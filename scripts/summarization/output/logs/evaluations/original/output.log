 Options 
 Pros.  Cons 
 Golf R – Quick, comfy, good price, manual (yay!).  Manual not available until later next year, looks are meh. 
 Z4 – Comfy, quick, hardtop convertible, manual, would be used.  Not much room, price (comparatively), BMW-owner reputation, looks expensive. 
 Mustang GT – Fun, quick, looks great but doesn’t stand out, good relationship with a Ford dealer.  Large, poor gas mileage (not critical, but can be a tie-breaker), worried about heavy clutch for city driving. 
 2012 TT RS – Fun, quick, 2+2 for insurance, unique without standing out a lot, did I mention quick?  Hard suspension, finding the right one (not driven hard) could be a challenge, wife not fond of styling, the tech looks old for bluetooth/nav. 
 Chevy SS – Manual! Low prices due to demand, V8 yum, decent interior, decent handling, doesn’t stand out.  Large, crazy gas-mileage, large, don’t trust GM much, still large 
 Taurus SHO – What I have, but it’s very large and not very connected. Kind of boring to drive, although it’s very comfortable and still quick. – Not interested in keeping 
 GLA45 – Quick, fun, nice interior, Mercedes quality, hatch practicality.  Expensive, looks expensive, no manual option. 
 M235i – Fun, quick, nice interior, nice size (allows me to bring my little dogs and wife at the same time), reasonable price.  BMW reputation, looks expensive, demand still so high it’s hard to find, had a bad experience last time I went to a BMW dealership. 
 Stingray – The obvious choice eh? Fast, fun, coupe has removable roof, looks to kill, reasonable price for what you get although straining budget.  Looks expensive, don’t trust GM, stands out especially on a younger male. 
 1967 Mustang – Considered buying an old one and getting a new interior put in. Love classic mustangs, looks great without standing out for expensiveness, can be made very comfortable, oh the cruising… I don’t know how to work on cars so would have to find a shop, not sure how expensive an interior would be (nice leather/soft-touch points/stereo/alarm/etc), would not handle well lik everything else on the list, anything added would not add to the value of the car so is money wasted. 
 Miata –  Nope. Thought about getting one with a v8, but I don’t want to buy one when the new one would be coming out within a year. Also, wife doesn’t care for them. 
 Your ideas!  Different than mine.  Different than mine.  ;)

Source: less basic income and more basic ownership. Basic income is a scheme to permanently defang the working class, and, most insidiously, it's promoted using language suggesting it'll actually be the best thing to ever happen to the working class. 
 So if I had a son, and I saved up money, I would buy myself and my son robots (or shares of robots). Those robots would work for me. Thus, my son would never have to work and gets comfort and happiness handed to him. And because our income comes from our robots rather than from taxes or wealth redistribution, you have no right to take that comfort and happiness away from him. 
 This could be all of society if we decided to directly own technotarians. 
 
 In honor of my gilding, I'll tell you how Vyrdism works. 
 First, read this: [As Vyrdists, We Must Accept A Truth Many Of Us Feel Sick Even Considering: The Free Market Works]( 
 So let me work it into a pyramid. 
 There's the base— Vyrdism is not anti-free market, so if you believe the free markets are the cause of all our problems, you're not going to like what I have to say anyway. You also probably think "free markets" is synonymous with "capitalism", which might explain why you feel that way. 
 Then there's the next level— Vyrdism is radically pro-automation and pro-technostist. As I said earlier, technostism is the promotion of automation. 
 There's the next level— [Vyrdists very strongly believe in the promise of worker cooperatives]( The ideas of worker ownership and worker self-management is one of the fundamental aspects of the idea. We believe that the Modern American Democratic left's insistence on promoting unions over cooperatives/collective bargaining over collective enterprise is what's caused the utter collapse of the Left. I personally blame the Bolsheviks for ruining Leftism; thanks to them, Leftist movements have decided that vanguard parties that treat a whole nation like an authoritarian-capitalist business is the only way forward, hence why we always get failed State-Socialist nations like Cuba, North Korea, Cambodia, Venezuela, etc. Not one Marxist-Leninist government remains save North Korea and Cuba, and no one is flocking to these countries. Nevertheless, the fact that Leftism  still  so often equals "bureaucracy and State force" even in the minds of Leftists themselves is troubling. 
 The next level— Vyrdists strongly oppose centralization. This means a love of things like blockchains, P2P, open source, free source, wikis, and 3D printing. We recognize why there's been such lopsided growth in recent years, why 'income inequality' is a big issue— we decided to throw off authoritarian modes of government but keep authoritarian modes of enterprise. Don't get me wrong, there's always a role for authority. However, the incomes of the poor and middle class have not risen anywhere near as much as the rich because the rich benefit from an authoritarian mode of power over economic matters. It's centralization in action. It's Statism by another name. 
 The next level— Vyrdists believe that political power comes from economic power. Attempts to alter economic power through political means have always failed and will always fail. After all— one does not establish dictatorship to safeguard the revolution; one throws revolution to establish the dictatorship.  So if you want to create lasting change, start/join a co-op, hook that co-op up to a larger federation, and keep building up from there. 
 The next level— Vyrdists like how feel-good worker co-ops are, but there's a point to supporting them. The intention is what separates us from traditional syndicalists. Once automation has sufficiently spread throughout society, we will be prepared, as we will own the machines. There are further ways to get involved in this in the off-chance you missed the initial opportunity, including [seed loans]( and [helotism]( 
 What did I mean up there by 'Grade-IV Automation?' I believe there are multiple grades of automation. 
 
 Grade-I is tool usage in general, from hunter-gatherer/scavenger tech all the way up to the pre-industrial age. 
 
 Grade-II is the usage of physical automation, such as looms, spinning jennies, and tractors. This is what the Luddites feared. 
 
 Grade-III is the usage of digital automation, such as personal computers, calculators, robots, and basically anything we in the modern age take for granted. This age will last a bit longer into the future, though the latter ends of it have spooked quite a few people. 
 
 Grade-IV is the usage of mental automation, and this is where things change. Grade-IV automation is where we finally see artificial general intelligence, meaning that one of our tools has become capable of creating new tools on its own. It is with Grade-IV automation that technostism, and thus Vyrdism, become possible (and, indeed, naturally begin occurring), as AI becomes capable of learning new tasks much more quickly than humans, and can instantly share its newfound knowledge with any number of other AI-capable machines connected to its network.

 Jay sneaks away from the team to rejoin his friends, but they recognise him as one of the 'terrorists' who destroyed Mercury Labs, and try to knock him out and turn him in. He is forced to flee. 
 Meanwhile the Monitor tests out it's new body on Stein and Ronnie, who just manage to touch before being killed. As FIRESTORM, they battle the Monitor and lose, but manage to escape alive. 
 At the end of the episode, The Monitor tracks and attacks the Legends, the Rogues and the two Rips. It appears that they are about to lose, but Ray, who had been experimenting with Rip's time sphere, creates a time portal. With the Monitor approaching, the three heroes accounted for (Our Rip, Ray and Kendra) jump into it and escape. 
 The first half of episode nine shows the three heroes arriving in Rip's time, where all of Earth's heroes are engaged in a full time war with the Anti-Monitor. Ray and Kendra discover their fates. Ray gets his first idea of 'becoming smaller', while Kendra realises that she is considered a vigilante, but is feared by the people. They both attempt to learn more, but Rip stops them. They are attacked by Anti-Monitor drones, and are forced to flee. 
 In the past, it is revealed that Sara, Jay, Snart, Mick Rory, and The Soldier all survived and fled to Starling City, with the Monitor having given up on them. As they go into hiding, FIRESTORM finds them and diffuses. Stein explains that he thinks The Monitor is going to go to ARGUS to upload itself into the Internet and become immortal. The heroes and villains agree to stop him. 
 In the future, Rip, Ray and Kendra meet with future Ray. Future Ray explains to past Ray that they are considered one of the greatest heroes, even without the suit. They fix the Time Sphere and the three are launched into the past. 
 At the very end of episode nine, Vandal Savage and Mr DeVoe arrive at ARGUS, having smuggled in a USB containing The Monitor. Savage assures Amanda Waller that his proposal for Earth's future will yield results. 
 The finale begins with one last flashback, revealing that Savage has a severe condition where any small injury could prove fatal. He is forced to live a sheltered life, and promises the world that some day he will be able to protect it, not with his body but with his mind. As a child, he writes his first plans for the Monitor program. 
 In the present, the heroes all assemble, with Rip, Ray and Kendra having returned. Ray has a new battery, which he uses to build a new ATOM suit while the others talk. Jay is still upset after being rejected by his friends back in episode 8. Kendra fears that her prophecy is about to come true, as Ray and Rip are the only ones confirmed to still exist in the future. Stein hears from a bug he planted on Savage that the Monitor is about to be uploaded, and the heroes launch into gear, with Stein reluctantly joining with Ronnie and becoming FIRESTORM again, and Ray finishes the ATOM MKII, which now has shrinking capabilities. 
 Meanwhile Savage talks with Waller, who rejects his proposal to upload the Monitor to the Internet (and make it the god that rules the future). He angrily responds by telling her that he knows his plan will work, and summons the Monitor's body into the building. It kills several ARGUS agents and shoots Waller. Before killing her, the Legends intervene. Rip and Sara escort Waller out of the building, and then chase Savage and DeVoe, while Kendra and Jay battle the Monitor. Kendra manages to slip a miniature Ray into the Monitor, and he begins to try and disable it. At the same time, The Rogues escort FIRESTORM to ARGUS's memory banks, to try and reject the Monitor program that Savage installed before it is too late. But The Rogues betray FIRESTORM and incapacitate Stein, leaving Ronnie powerless. They attempt to flee with an arsenal of equipment, but Snart feels guilty and heads back, only to end up fighting (and defeating) Rory. 
 Ray is forced to improvise without Stein's instructions, while Kendra and Jay tries to keep the Monitor occupied. And Rip and Sara chase Savage to the courtyard, and although DeVoe flees, Savage simply calls his army in for backup. Rip and Sara are surrounded by Savage's army, but The Soldier decides to intervene, breaking the laws of time travel, and saves them. Savage is apprehended and the Monitor USB is destroyed. 
 Ray manages to destroy the Monitor armour, and returns to full size. He flies off with the armour to destroy any traces of it by dumping it in the water. Kendra heads down to help Stein, and with him unconscious, she realises that the only way to destroy the last traces of the Monitor is to destroy the building, killing everyone inside, along with the two Rips and Sara. She can't bring herself to do it. Jay eventually realises that a piece of the Monitor exists inside of him, and he can coax the program inside the system to enter his body instead. Knowing he'll die, Kendra tries to convince him not to, but he decides that he has no life worth living anymore anyway. He absorbs it and, self-destructing from the information overload, departs into the forest, where he explodes. 
 In the aftermath, The Soldier comes to Sara and informs her that she has to die. Rip decides to jump in, having grown fond of the girl, and says that he will kill her himself once the job is done. The Soldier asks how Rip expects to live himself, and Rip replies that he won't change anything too severe, and can't exist in the future anyway. The Soldier begrudgingly agrees and travels back to the future, taking Rip's time sphere with him. 
 At the end, Waller dismisses the crimes against the Legends, and Rip assembles a new team, consisting of himself, Ray, Kendra, Sara, Snart and FIRESTORM. Mick Rory is sent to the STAR Labs pipeline, and everything seems happy. 
 However, we see in the closing montage (during Rip's heroic victory speech), that Rip still has a time sphere, which he is keeping a secret from the team. We don't know how he got it. And to close the season, we see Jay awaken, looking more robotic than ever. The Monitor then speaks to him, having been built into his system. It asks can Jay hear him, and Jay says 'yes'. End the season there. 
 If you read through all of that, or some of it, consider me impressed. Please leave a comment saying what you think of my season idea, and if you liked it let me know. I plan to keep this little essay typed out, and will be comparing it to the real show when it's released! Please let me know what you think!
