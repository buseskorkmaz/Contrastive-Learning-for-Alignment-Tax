"Long Story Short: I'm starting a new campaign of a kick ass game, Houses of the Blooded. I've been re-reading Dune, and also more recently S.M. Stirling's In the Courts of the Crimson Kings, so I've been all into desert style settings. 
 As I was writing the long intro for the game I had an ice water down the neck moment. I checked one of my player's LJ and sure enough, the campaign he just started in for the same game is a desert setting. DOH! 
 I don't want to compete with him and want to do something original. The characters are all playing young nobles and the themes for my game are: a rising merchant class, piracy, social castes, intrigue, Technology is almost 100% Organic, and possibly the discovery of a 'New World'. Airships and mountainous archipelago's could work, or some such, but I'm not sure. 
 Please Help me Out!","Can you help me think of a new kick ass setting that doesn't involve Polynesian archipelagos, deserts, standard European settings, Japan or China, or Greece.","Thanks for reading, I'll definitely be playing House of the Blooded.

"Commenting here for visibility, unrelated to Dirt 3(although I agree it's an amazing game with shit DLC): 
 Just tried Grid 2. In its own right, the game is fun, however, if you were looking for something along the lines of sim-racing, look elsewhere. It is INCREDIBLY arcade-y. From the gameplay footage and the first Grid, I expected better driving physics than this. There isn't a cockpit view. Indy cars drift. All cars drift. I use a Fanatec racing wheel, and it just feels like I'm playing those racing games at Chuck-e-cheese. 
 Unless I missed some type of option in the menu, I can't recommend this game for anyone who's looking for a racing game with the same feel as Dirt3 or NFS:Shift2. If you're not looking for a simracer, then get the game, it's tons of non-serious fun.","Grid 2 is fun, but driving physics don't feel real. Feels like I'm playing Dirt: Showdown, rather than Dirt3.","Thanks for reading. I'll be back next week.

"Currently on my 2nd read of all the books, and I just started ASOS yesterday. In Tyrion I, there's a very prominent line spoken by Tywin to Tyrion that we all know foreshadowed the Red Wedding: ""Some battles are won with swords and spears. Others with quills and ravens."" 
 &nbsp; 
 After reading this, it got me thinking that this may not be the first instance where Tywin Lannister has won himself a battle through means other than sword and spear. The next major battle he's known for (other than the current one with Robb/Stannis) is the Sack of Kings' Landing. Originally I thought there was no way for him to pull this move, he just got lucky. But then another Tyrion chapter from ACOK sprung into my head - Tyrion VI - where he and Shagga break Pycell's door down and take him into custody. 
 &nbsp; 
 In the midst of that piss-soaked ordeal, Pycell is begging for mercy by telling Tryion that everything he's done has been for House Lannister. He even goes as far as telling Tyrion that he was the one who convinced Aerys to open his doors to none other than Tywin Lanninster (sorry I don't have the book with me so I can't give a direct quote). Which made me think why would he have done so? Aside from being strategically placed there by Tywin himself (which seems unlikely), is it possible that Tywin wrote to Pycell (who handles the ravens in KL) in order to use him as a means of bringing his army into KL in the event that the battle is all but won by Bobby B? 
 &nbsp; 
 Yes it would have been a risky move on Tywin's part - we all know how Aerys goes about handing acts of treason. And it could all just be coincidental and Pycell recognizing that Aerys was a complete nut job and wanted to put his reign to an end. Either way, I thought it was a cool idea to share. 
 &nbsp;","Tywin wrote to Pycell during Robert's Rebellion and convinced him to open the gates at KL and effectively creating the ""Red Sack of KL.""","Thanks for reading!

"He's now a ""consultant"" for Ambit energy. Simply typing the search term ""ambit"" in to google and the third suggestion down is ""ambit energy scam"". My dad made an investment of $400 and pays $30 a month for a page on ambit's website. He told me in confidence that he gets $100 for every 5 people that sign up and that the real money is in the residuals he will receive if he gets other people to work for them. 
 This worries me because my dad has already lost a lot of money on really stupid investments. He is pretty much the sole provider for our family, my mom makes money but hardly any and she's pretty much burying her head in the sand on this one. I'm just worried about crushing his pride and sending him into another depression/alcohol binge. 
 I am 20 and he's 50. He calls me retarded and stupid all the time while he thinks he's a genius. I want to tell him its a scam and save him the hurt in his wallet but knowing my dad I could see him hyper-concentrating on it to earn money and proove me wrong and constantly bring it up every single day.","My dad is investing time and money into a scam, should I tell him? Even it means I will be mocked and called a fool for doubting his genius method? 
 Edit:  Thanks for the responses, I think I'm going to just drop hints like jengi suggested. I wouldn't be worried but since his other business has failed it seems like he is pretty focused on this as his new career. Even though he's a dick some times I can't knowingly let him invest too much into this.","What should I do?

"It's like time travel, isn't it? I know how it is, I used to work for the university of Vienna, which was established 1365 and the last time we updated procedures was apparently after the second siege of Vienna by the Ottoman Empire. 
 The only way to get mail to a certain department which was nestled within the department of Egyptian studies like some sort of academic lamprey was to by taking it there. On foot. Why? Because they didn't have a letterbox. And why didn't they have one? Because they adhered to some original part of the academic code when everything was housed in a single building instead of 50+ buildings erratically scattered all over the city. And why did they still adhere to this? Because they were overlooked when the post box licenses where handed out. In 1897. The last time you needed a license to own a letterbox was before the fall of the old empire in 1918. So why not mail it to the (comparatively) modern department of egyptian studies? Because all the mail gets delivered to the main building and library, four streets away, as the office in question and main building have seperate physical adresses, but the same mailing adress. The postal code is from a time when your mailman knew you by first and last name in an area that now houses 1.75 million people. 
 So you walk. Or rather, go two stops by tram, and then walk up six flights of stairs. To find out they're not there. But it wasn't possible to call them ahead of time. Because they have no telephone.
