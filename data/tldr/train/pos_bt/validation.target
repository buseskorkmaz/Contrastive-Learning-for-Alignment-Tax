how do you think about this? Will Batman's strategies of inducing fear will actually help against an entire criminal underworld who has been ruling Gotham for a very long time, through intimidation as well, in order to be hesitant the next time they will engage in criminal acts? IMO ... I am not sure, to be perfectly honest. I mean, plenty of people have encountered Batman a lot but he is mainly a superstition because of how Batman moves and operates. I think the main reason why he still operates this way, is because of the means of power. These crime lords have had that amount of power for so long that they spread corruption, oppression and also fear to all of Gotham's citizens. So, to induce fear to these criminals, they will think that there is something, or someone, who much more powerful than them, much more powerful than even the justice department (even though Batman is not exactly above the law) so that they know what it means to be feared and oppressed being something more powerful than them, same methods that they did to the people of Gotham Which I do say, there is a reason why many criminals are hesitant to do criminal acts because of something that they are not sure if it even real, but then again, Batman has been around for 75 years, so I am guessing .... a) Plenty of criminals do not believe in superstitious stories b) Plenty of criminals, especially these powerful crime lords, like Penguin, Black Mask, Scarecrow and so on are still willing to show who's boss and are not willing to bow down to anyone and willing to stay in power as much as possible, even against someone who around the law (not actually above it), as evidenced in plenty of comic book releases c) These criminals are still undergoing through criminal activities because of the example that I have just mentioned. So Batman's did not actually prevent crime, it actually escalated crime. Sort of, because plenty of comic book releases say otherwise
I'm not sure, to be perfectly honest. I mean, many people have met a lot of Batman but it is mainly a superstition because of how Batman moves and works. I think the main reason why it always works in this way, is because of the means of power. These lords of crime have had this amount of power for so long that they spread corruption, oppression and also fear to all Gotham citizens. So, to induce fear to these criminals, they will think that there is something, or someone, that much more powerful than them, much more powerful than even the service of justice that remains, even if Batman is not exactly above the law.
I believe that Batman's strategies of inducement fear actually help against an entire criminal underworld that Gotham has ruled for a very long time, by intimidation as well as to be hesitant, the next time they will engage in criminal acts? IMO... I'm not sure to be perfectly honest. I mean, many people have encountered Batman a lot, but he is above all a superstition because, as Batman moves and works. I think the main reason why he still operates this way is because of the means of power. These criminals lords have this amount of power for so long that they spread corruption, oppression and also fear of all of Gotham's citizens. So, to arouse fear, they will think that there is something, or someone who is much more powerful than they are, much stronger than the justice department (even if Batman is not exactly above the law)
So Batman's strategies of inducing fear will really help against a whole criminal underworld that has been ruling Gotham for a long time, through intimidation as well, to be hesitant the next time they get involved in criminal acts? OMI... I'm not sure, to be perfectly honest. I mean, a lot of people have found Batman a lot, but he's mainly a superstition because of how Batman moves and operates. I think the main reason why he still operates this way, is because of the means of power. These crime lords have had that amount of power for so long that they spread corruption, oppression and also fear all the citizens of Gotham. So, to induce fear these criminals, they will think that there is something, or someone, that much more powerful than they are, far more powerful than even the justice department (although Batman is not exactly above the law) (even so many criminals are in prison, they even know what is much more than the power of genealogy, and much more still are in the power of genealogy, so they are in the power of genealogy, so they are more than the genealogy than they are in the power of genealogy.

Basically, I'd need a good pair of headphones, which need to be comfortable to wear for medium-long periods of time (2 hours most of the time), for outdoor use and public transport, so they need to be closed so music doesn't leak out, either on-ear or circumaural because I hate IEMs and earbuds with all my heart. Neutral sound would be optimal for me. Since I'm using those with my phone, a microphone would be great to have, doesn't matter if it has buttons; if it does have buttons though, they'd need to be compatible with Android, since I own a OnePlus One. Last words: So yeah! This is basically it. I know it's a lot to ask, but I really have no clue! I had my eyes on the Sennheiser Momentum, and I saw some sites recommending the AKG451, but I think those are outdated. Can you please help a newcomer to audio choose his pair of headphones? Thanks in advance.

A write-off is something that you can deduct from your gross income. It lowers the amount of income you have to pay tax on. So, interest on student loans, IRA contributions, self-employed health insurance premiums, and HSA contributions - all are write-offs or deductible from gross income. The items I just mentioned are better write-offs than, say, charitable contributions or home-mortgage interest deduction because it only makes sense to write off the latter two if your itemized deductions goes over a certain amount.Summary: A write-off is something that you can deduct from your gross income.

I need to find a fitting that will bolt onto a 13mm hole and accept a 5mm tube. [See this diagram for a better explanation.]( EDIT: MYSTERY SOLVED! They are called "glands" which is apparently just another term for compression fittings according to wikipedia. I went back to the original site where they sell the larger fitting and I noticed it said that you have to buy the nut that secures it to the glass separately. I looked at the nut and it had an "M25" in it's name. When I googled M25 a chart came up showing thread sizes. I guess M25 is the diameter of the bolt shaft, so I realized I'm not looking for an exact fit, but a closest with out going over fit. I looked at the chart and M12 was the closest.

Its still a section of analytical philosophy and shouldn't be confused otherwise, and it still doesn't escape the same arguments I've posted as before. If intelligent design does exist, free will then exists within the theistic concept of modern religions. If no intelligent creator exists, then there is no free will and all of our knowledge if illusory as it serves biological survival and not the truth.

With renting and buying you seem to "throwaway" about the same amount of money in the short term. However, if you like more space, less rules, but less flexibility and plan on being able to stay in the same house for 10 years then buying is still the better option (especially if you can buy a reasonable house and be able to send extra money each year to knock down the wasted interest).

light is often accompanied by other forms of energy, radiation, and subatomic particles and could easily cool and form matter if produced in a large enough quantity; since matter, energy, and time are all relative it reveals that God either A) existed before time or B) created himself when he created the universe. Next, there are many cases of inbreeding in animals in the fossil record that especially occurred after mass extinctions, and abiogenesis would be like nature creating a clock out springs, gears, and machinery. Too much would have to be absolutely perfect in order for the clock to start that results in a margin of error being something that nature itself couldn't be capable of

If you can find someone who ran as a tea party candidate that had racist policies and platformed on such, I'll be willing to converse more. Individuals do not represent a group.

Animal experiences are not experiences worthy of human-experience-like respect Relevant OldBoy scene: [It must feel weird to eat an animal while it's still alive.]( Doesn't make it unethical though. (A question this reasoning raises for me, is why cruelty to non-human life wrong. I'd suggest it is wrong specifically because of the intent/conduct of the human inflicter, rather than the effect on the animal. Which is why attempted cruelty is wrong, and keeping potted-plants, fish and cats trapped in human homes is not. The presumed lack of malicious intent justifies the human's actions perhaps.)

My mom is moving out 2 minutes down the road after rashly blurting out to my little sister about the separation. Everything is messier. [EDIT] I feel people are concentrating on my losing my temper that one time with my mother. I understand that it was terrible and not at all a help. I want to stress that apart from that incident, I have been avoiding conflict and spend most of my time with Jenny and making her feel better, talking and playing video games.

Best friends with group of guys, they all did well for themselves, I had to move 5 hours away to get my act together, little to no effort on their part over the last 4 years with keeping in touch, but when I make an effort to see them they act like we're best friends still. Now all grown up and wanting to know if they're worth the effort or just let them fade away?
