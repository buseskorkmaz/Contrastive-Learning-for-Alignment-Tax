It did but, to be honest, it was nothing compared to breaking my hand and getting surgery there. Overall, I would recommend surgery to anybody who has a displaced clavicle fracture. The biggest pain was mental for me. My shoulder was noticeably shorter for a whole year. I have broad, manly shoulders and one was gimped by the bad healing. I was also considerably weaker. I let it get to me - hating the way it looked (this coming from a guy who usually never gives a shit about appearance). I also hated the way it felt - tense all the time. I'm glad the doctor fixed it, but now it feels really spongy after working out and it gets tired when I type for long periods which is a bummer because I am a newspaper journalist. TL;DR
Have to disagree with you here. Nitefinders don't shoot streamlines (very well). I you buy an Elite Blaster with the blue streamlines than you are fine but otherwise I would suggest looking at the Darttag line which has a number of blasters that work with the same darts as the nitefinder. TL;DR
A lot of you requested an update to my [original post]( The majority of you suggested that I speak to Brooke and/or attempt to walk in on the act. I decided on doing both. Sunday night everyone was back in the apartment. I had every intention of speaking to Brooke about the neighbor's comment alone, but before I could she said something that completely threw my theory off. She told Derek to get to bed so he wouldn't be tired for work in the morning. What. I knew Derek has a job on campus, but he had always worked the same night shifts. Being as casual as possible, I inquired how long he'd been working mornings and when he started. He said he picked up the extra shifts a month ago and worked at 9. (I leave at 7:45 so it's possible for me not to have noticed that). I spent the rest of the night trying to figure out whether he was lying about that, whether still he had some mornings here at home, whether Alexis could be seeing someone other than Derek in the mornings (like some of you suggested) or (again) if I was just a paranoid loser. I went to bed feeling emotionally drained and confused. The next morning I left for classes as usual and operated on autopilot. I alternated between thinking I'd run home to check on Alexis and thinking I had way too much work to run around based on a theory that I wasn't even sure about anymore. In the end, I walked out of my first class and straight to my car to go home. In a weird way, I sort of wish I hadn't. When I got to the apartment Derek's car wasn't there, just Alexis'. I walked to the apartment with my heart pounding all sorts of crazy. I don't know what I was expecting. Outside the apartment door I could immediately here a guy's voice inside. I heard him talking and laughing and a soft feminine mumble replying and giggling back. I've been on this subreddit long enough to see all the different reactions people have to this situation. I never once contemplated what I'd do. I pressed my ear to the door and see if I could make out what they were saying, but I could only make out a word here and there. There was a lot of giggling. Then, I heard the sound of Alexis being tickled and shrieking. Maybe I should've waited more. In retrospect I wish I did, but I couldn't take it. As soon as I started fiddling with my keys, it was dead silence in there. She was fucking Mark. I never mentioned Mark in the previous post but he's one the guys in the apartment next to us ( not the one that tipped me off). He's the only one I never liked. Fucking know-it-all douchebag attitude. Always made inappropriate comments towards both girls. Never thought anything of it. As soon as I opened the door, they both gave me a deer-in-headlights look that removed any naiive doubt I may have retained that the situation was innocent. I was planning on yelling at them or demanded answers, but (and this is fucking embarrassing) my eyes began to well with tears. I didn't want them to see that shit. So I said "Nice. Real fucking nice." and bolted back to my car. I heard Alexis yelling my name in the hallway and picked up the pace. I sort of expected her to be chasing me but by the time I got to the car there was no one following me. I drove to a park that's near the apartment and sat there in disbelief. My first thought, weirdly enough was How is my family going to take this? What the hell am I going to tell them? My family fucking loved Alexis. They joked about our wedding and regularly called her part of the family. Then I started thinking about living arrangements. Our finals end in about two weeks, there's no way I can handle moving now. I'm applying to an extremely competitive graduate program and I can't let anything get in the way of that. Definitely not this cheating bitch. I'm writing this from a friend's house. I explained the situation, he explained it to his parents and they welcomed me to stay in their home. I'm going to have to go back home to get some clothes sometime. I'm planning on going during this lab period I know Alexis can't skip tomorrow. It took her an hour or so to start blowing up my phone, but once she did it didn't stop. She started off asking me to come home so she could explain. Before I even had the chance to respond she sent another one begging me to come back because she was having an anxiety attack, something I always help her through. Maybe I'm heartless, but all I could think was good, you earned it . There was a pause and then she sent "I don't know why you get so jealous, we were just hanging out." I waited. She sent "Look, I know it looks super sketchy, believe me if I were you I'd think the same thing, but we didn't do anything. He needed advice on his girl problems. You have to believe me." No, no I don't. Normally I would have gotten a weird sense of satisfaction watching a cheater scramble to cover their ass, but my stupid brain just kept replaying all these great times we had together and wondering if she was cheating then too. I want to know when this started, but at the same time I'm worried it's been going on for longer than the month I've suspected something. I received a text later that night from a number I didn't recognize. It was the nice dude from next door. He said (paraphrasing because it was a long text) that he got my number from Derek. He was extremely sorry for what I was going through and that he would have told me sooner but he wasn't completely sure. He said he knew his friend was seeing a girl with a boyfriend, but didn't put it together until he learned the girl's name. As many of you suspected, the comment was him trying to tip me off. So yeah, I guess he's bro of the year. I don't think Derek and Brooke know yet. I haven't texted them. I haven't found the words. I know it's going to turn our living arrangement and friendships upside down. I guess I should message them before Alexis paints a different picture. I wonder what the cool neighbor said when he asked for my number. I don't think he told them, the would have said something... Right? Unless they took her side. Then I've lost my girlfriend and friends. Any advice on coping with something like this, especially from those who have been there before, please let me know. I don't have many friends to reach out to besides the guy I'm staying with. Alexis, Brooke and Derek were basically my family. Alexis and I had talked about spending our lives together. I have never been serious about a girl the way I was with her. EDIT: I am seriously moved by the amount of support you guys are giving me here. Please keep them coming, I may not reply to all the comments but I've read each one on both posts. I'm going to tell Derek and Brooke soon. I'll try to do a follow up when I have some sort of plan. TL;DR
Forget the reality of Batman for a moment, like the amount of training he needs to take to become that physically athletic or the impossible achievements that is needed to become Batman, or how one man is like an entire army against the entire crime underworld in the city of Gotham that is based of the city of Chicago …. I am talking about his methods of intimidation and inducing-fear into his enemies. Don't get me wrong, I love that about Batman and he is one of my most favourite comic book heroes of all time and somehow quite understandable, considering the plenty of mob bosses and feared criminal leaders have had Gotham at their fingertips for far too long and have been ruling it through terror, corruption and even chaos, so it is very reasonable and thoughtful process for Bruce Wayne for challenge Gotham's criminal underworld the same way that criminals do .... fear. So that all criminals would know that they are not in charge anymore and get a taste of their own medicine and fear is a very powerful emotion. It is an emotion that gives you great wisdom when there is danger around. That is why people become hesitant when they see an angry tiger looking at them dead in the eye like it is ready to pounce with its fangs and teeth ready and exposed, same for Batman when he is hiding in the shadows, looking like a demonic beast, who just came from hell to punish them for their sins. So, I am wondering ... will Batman's methods actually work? I am a psychology student, and we have come across a psychological phenomenon called fear-arousal appeal, which is a strategy for motivating people to take a particular action, endorse a particular policy, or buy a particular product, by arousing fear. This develops a lot of many media, mostly on television. But there is a catch, too much fear will cause too much anxiety to the person and they will often avoid that phenomenon, or in worst cases, it will give them so much anxiety because they will soon believe that what that induced fear is telling them, like you are worthless, or you are weak, and so on. And this has been done a lot in the past and failed miserably. That strategy often backfires and instead of making the people not stop that behaviour that the message was intending to portray, they actually do it more (Like a parent is always criticising about anything that the kid does and scold them, to the point that turns into abuse, but anyway) Too much fear will actually be too anxious and too harmful and studies have suggested that people are more likely to continue to behave in their delinquent acts Plus, we know that people don't actually engage in criminal acts by choice. Those who are criminals are people who have gone through tough challenges in life like poor environments, poor social support, low socio-economic status and so on. So, no one does these "evil acts" by choice. (which is somehow a good reason why I like Batman so much because there is a good reason why Batman refuses to kill and rather sends them to justice and focuses a lot on funding for the mentally ill and orphanages and for the poor because he knows that his enemies are not so different than he is because they were more than victims of unfortunate circumstances, just like he was, so he will willing to bring them justice but also willing to give them a second chance in life, over and over again.)

I've been in a relationship with this guy for the past year, and like all it started out great, and we encountered some problems, and we got through a lot of them. This past summer though, I got increasingly busy with summer course, work, traveling, and trying to spend time with friends only in town for the summer. Our relationship was good where we both knew we were busy and didn't need to be around each other all the time to prove we loved each other. Yet as the summer went on, I started to feel as if I was obligated to spend my free time with him. Not in way where he forced me to, but in the way where if I did have any free time I felt guilty if I used it for alone time rather than spending time with him. So I asked if for the summer we could take a break, just with our different schedules and what not, I thought it would help bring back wanting to be with each other for the sake of being with each other, if that makes sense. Turned out we are not really good at taking breaks, and we still went out to movies or dinner, and had sex and hung out. It just felt different though, like we really did want to be with each other, even though technically we kept calling it a break. Flash forward a month and I just get back from a three week trip, couldn't be more excited to see him, and to celebrate a year of being together. (Only because we decided the break was stupid, and we would just count our time like we didn't even take one.) Now that was a Monday, one of our best dates ever, come Wednesday he tells me we need to talk. So we meet up, and he starts off by saying how much he loves me and cares for me and would never do anything to hurt me, then starts to tell me about how while we were on our "break" he had slept with another girl. (Long story about who it was too.) So now I'm torn between technicalities and how I feel. TL;DR
Hey there, I'm new to this subreddit (just stumbled upon it). I have taken a look at the format page, and those are my info: Budget: €130, $160 +- 30 Source: OnePlus One, Android based phone. Requirements for Isolation: I'm not too worried about isolation, read on to understand. I would use this pair of headphones during my 2h trips everyday on the bus, and during the small walking way to school. Preferred Type of Headphone: I've used on-ears for a while, and I'd like to try out over-ear, or circumaural. On-ear are fine as well, provided they are comfortable. Preferred tonal balance: Not too sure, I've only ever listened to System of a Down and some dubstep occasionally. Neutral should be good, even though I enjoy bass. Past headphones: I've owned a pair of AKG K518LE, and they worked decently for me, until I broke the right pad accidentally. They were on-ear, but they isolated me quite well from outside, and there was absolutely no leak of audio, nobody would hear my music. That's a feature I'd like to keep. Preferred Music: Already answered before, mainly hard rock, metal, dubstep and occasionally some electro. Location: Italy, I usually buy from amazon.it and prices there are quite good. Summary ( TL;DR
Today....it was great. I realized that starting off fresh with a sorc wasn't going to cut it. I had to take it the good ole fashion way. Necro summoner. BoonDocks. That was his name. He still lives. He's in his 50's and currently going strong. But it's not because of that, that he will be remembered. It is his journey that he will be remembered for. The journey that started with a 2 complete strangers doing tombs, and when BoonDocks joined it became a 3 man game. Note that at this point BoonDocks had not passed act 2 and thus realized he could party with these tombers and potentially finish act 2. Little did you know, another fellow joined and came along, another necromancer. Now making it a 4 man trade. We realized that our name was deceiving after shortly beating Duriel, so we remade our game and called it Act3 start or something along those lines. And there, a great journey began. More and more people joined. We joined forces. We lived memories. We lived our childhood dreams once more. We were in an 8 man party going from Act 3 onwards to Act 5 in Nightmare mode. We had three necromancers full of skeletons and summons, while we had a brave sorceress teleport on HER OWN WILL to the several new places in nightmare mode. I can't forget to mention we had an assassin who sat with her traps (note she said she did no damage, but looked like she did tons of damage), then we had a paladin who's skills and stats were totally wrong, and last but not least we had two remaining sorceress dishing out their meteors and their frozen orbs. You could not believe the lag this 8 man team made. It was like back in the day when everyone hated necro summoners. We lived memories. We lived strong. And we remembered the good times. Cheers to you all. Thank you for spending the day with me. You will forever be remembered. TL;DR
So I have a gig coming up in a few weeks and I noticed that out of the 5 other DJs playing, 4 are all listed as playing Electro and/or Dubstep (the 5th is playing DnB/Breaks). I play Techno, Deep House, Tech House and some Progressive. I asked the promoter if he was sure he wanted me to play those genres and he said he likes what he's heard from me from my mixes and a couple of other places I've gigged at. If that's what he wants, I'm not going to complain. It's a gig! What I want to know is, what are a few tracks that would go over well for the above genres that fit into the type of music I play? That is, what are some Techno/Tech House/Deep House tracks that an Electro/Dubstep crowd would probably really dig? I'm not asking for help planning my entire set. I've got a pretty solid collection of tunes that usually work well for a group that appreciates Techno etc. I'm just looking for a couple of tracks that maybe I can mix in/out with the DJs before and after me and still keep the dubsteppers happy. TL;DR
first post: second post: I talked to her earlier tonight. It was a very, very, VERY mature and well-mannered conversation. We broke up. We both realized that neither of us were happy with the relationship, and that we didn't want to continue hurting each other or treating each other poorly. She claimed she wanted to be single for awhile since she's learned that she's not willing to make the emotional commitment to a relationship, and wanted to sort out her own personal issues. We basically left the conversation as friends, and on good terms. We're back where we started before we started dating, and that's honestly a best-case scenario for both of us. It's like a great big relief. I can finally stop worrying about her for good. TL;DR
She probably saw a guy in a turban and thought he should have been the one searched. TL;DR
ugh. this is a gross one and TMI but I had a baby last year. A couple of months after I got my first post partum period. My OB said it would probably be lighter and it was. So I set out for a trip to the mall. Now I should probably say that I was at least 20lbs heavier than I am now, holding a baby because she refused to sleep in her stroller, and I was sweating my balls off in a poorly chosen outfit (I was dressed for 50 degrees and it was more like 70). So I'm sweating and noticing a large amount of ...for lack of a better phrase... swamp ass. Not really thinking much of it I decide to leave and head into the parking lot. I start noticing more and more wetness but Im thinking, okay im walking pretty quickly in the hot sun. I put baby in the car, get in and go WTF. Red all the way down to my knees. Yep. OB was wrong, my period was super heavy. TL;DR
Probably my best friend bullying me. Let me Clarify. So I've been living in the same house all of my life on the same street, filled with pretty nice neighbors, though no one my age to play with for the longest time, until I was about 8 or 9. There was a new family that moved in to a house a couple houses down at the start of summer, my parents told me that it was a family of 6 with a son about my age. Lets just call him J. Me and him instantly became fantastic friends and spent the whole summer together, I'd mostly go over to his house as he had the better gaming console and his family seemed nice, though a little bit more un-civilized than a normal family would be. I remember almost every week sleeping over or rather staying up all night playing videogames and eating pizza. At the end of the summer I found out that J. had enrolled in a Catholic school rather than the public school I was going to so I was a bit upset about that but still, after school whenever we could we would hang out. As we grew older I saw his family somewhat start to fall apart, his 2nd oldest brother ran into trouble with some drug dealers and had to hide, for a couple of weeks there was always a cop car circling our neighborhood, and I'm sure there was many other things that I didn't know of that happened in that house, yet we still stayed friends up to me and him going to 8th grade. It turned out that he got expelled from his catholic school for what I did not discover until much later, telling a jewish boy to "Go to the showers". Me being the innocent minded kid that had only been introduced to Halo by going over to J's house and rarely watching PG-13 movies (I was somewhat of a goodie-goodie) didn't think anything of it because I thought that it was a mistake. I later found that he was going to my middle school, my mother also not knowing until later that he got expelled from his old school asked the consoling office to put me and him in as many classes as possible so he could adjust into the school with my help. This is when stuff started to get bad. The first couple of weeks were fine but I felt something was wrong, instead of me and him hanging out after school he would be at other friend's houses, me being the more unpopular person didn't really have any other friends that I could go to so I would just sit around all day, watching TV and playing videogames. About a month into class is when things really took a turn for the worse. Back in middle school I was short and chubby so I was already picked on by others, but you would not believe how much it hurt wen as I walked into class J said, "What's up porky?", it completely caught me off guard and was the most devastating thing to here him say, even though I thought of him as a friend at the time. Over the course of the first semester this continued and I made the biggest mistake of not telling anyone else about it. At this point I was a mess, I never went outside and was on the verge of suicide, Thank goodness my mom noticed, it was due to her constant nagging about asking what was the matter that I didn't take my life. We had a good long talk, just me, her, and my dad, over the problems and she immediately went to the principal about it. J had to come into the office with his parents and I did with mine and he apologized to me, as we were leaving I never forgot the look in his dads eyes towards his son and didn't want to know what he did to him that night, J. didn't go to school for the rest of the week due to the suspension he was given by the principal though I don't think he would've anyway. Though this didn't stop the problem, only delay it. Next semester the same thing began to happen, this time I went to my parents again, and they went to the principal. Though all they ever did was slap him on the wrist, tell him no, and give him a one day suspension. I became depressed again and started spending all the classes I had with him in the office, just doing boring generic school work, I stayed home a lot of days from school and that didn't really change. Come highschool I had no classes with him and come Sophomore year discovered that he got suspended. I never saw him again at school and only occasionaly saw him on the street. I later found out from new friends that he became a low beat drug dealer, someone I'd never wanted to be related with. The rest of highschool went fine from then on out. TL;DR
I work at a small pet store and by virtue there are only one or two people working at a time. My friend RJ and I both have been working here for over a year and being in high school, we probably weren't the ideal employees to be working the store solo, regardless we have been doing so every Friday for over a year and have yet to have any major issues. Tonight was the night that something would go wrong. It was near closing and there was only ever one person in the store at a time. I was working the register while RJ was in the back stacking up dog food. A lady walks up the counter and hands me some stuff to ring up and I promptly do so. Before she pays, I go to add her to the laptop we keep by the register which we use to keep info for our rewards club. She tells me her name and I whip around to go punch in her name and BAM, RJ's water bottle goes bottom up. Needless to say it was in the wrong place at the wrong time and now the computer is covered in water. The lady at the counter obliviously sees this and says something pseudo helpful and I slickly assure her that the computer is totally fine. I proceed to pick up the computer with one hand, hovering it over the water while I swipe her card. I smoothly play it off as if this happens all the time and then politely usher her out, apologizing for the delay. Just as she leaves, RJ comes up to the front. I pull a cool "uh, hey you want to get some paper towels" and he goes to the back to get some paper towels. When he gets back he is in a state of panic when he sees the computer. Me being a self proclaimed computer whiz (I've been building computers for a few years so I know a little) I decide that some paper towels and a good shake will get the water out and we will be all good; that was not the case. As I go to unplug the mouse and other various cables the thing shuts down, this was the first big issue. RJ says quizzically "did you just shut that off?", and I reply with an shocked "no I did not". Now, RJ is not the best person to confide in under pressure so I knew that keeping him calm was a good idea but at this point there was nothing I could do. RJ, knowing I work with computers, told me to do what I needed and he would go mull around the store. Frankly I'm pretty sure he was more worried that I was. Long story short, I crammed paper towels in every orifice of that computer that they would stay in and then put an entire tree worth of towels on top of the keyboard and closed the screen. At this point there was nothing else that I could do so I began thinking of ways that I can minimize the fallout from this. Mid thought, RJ comes up to me and says, "You gonna call Dave (our boss)", so me not wanting to be a total ass, I call him up. Keeping to the mood of the night, I pretend that it was just a drop of water and I shut the computer off so that It wouldn't short out. My boss buys it and I tell him that worst case we swap the hard drive out and stick it in a new computer that I'll buy. I wasn't too worried about buying a new computer given that the one there was no less than 8 years old at the time. So it turned out to be not too bad right?No. Dave asks if I saved the spreadsheet we use to keep customer info before I "Shut it off". Yeah all of that days data was gone. Problem. Lucky for me my boss was in a good mood and he didn't make a big deal over it, partly because he only thought he lost a days worth of rewards info. I left work that day, a few more unfortunate things happened to me between then and the time I got home, and so I decided the only way to end a bad day was by going to sleep before more could happen. Now its the next morning, someone else is working and I'm not there. I hope to god that the store can operate without the computer and my boss doesn't tear my ass in two when he realizes how much he has lost. To my surprise, the computer booted up perfectly which proved to be nothing short of a miracle considering it basically killed itself the night before. The true miracle was not that the computer survived however, but the fact that for nearly an hour when I was dealing with this crisis, not a single person came into the store. TL;DR
I'm not a CPA, but I like to do my own taxes. A write-off is something that you can deduct from your gross income. It lowers the amount of income you have to pay tax on. So, interest on student loans, IRA contributions, self-employed health insurance premiums, and HSA contributions - all are write-offs or deductible from gross income. The items I just mentioned are better write-offs than, say, charitable contributions or home-mortgage interest deduction because it only makes sense to write off the latter two if your itemized deductions goes over a certain amount. TL;DR
If you are a creationist, this post does not apply to you (cause you clearly don't understand that Jews have their own cultural mythology, like literally every other culture). However, I find a similar idea coming from bloopers who believe that humans are just so above nature. If we accept the premise that humans evolved from an earlier ancestor, then we must admit that both our biology and behaviors are influenced by that evolutionary process. We have sharp teeth, because cooking and eating meat is part of what it means to be human. I personally don't have trouble with vegetarians who do so because of political or religious reasons, even though I may disagree with them. But I absolutely cannot stand vegans, because their absolute denial of our evolution means that we cannot even share pizza together, or scrambled eggs, or cereal. I believe that men especially need meat in their diet more than women. Likewise I cannot stand people (usually in the Cult of Feminism) who deny basic sex differences and say that its all cosmetic. Men and women ARE different, and this balance is part of what makes human beings successful. Sure, we cannot know for sure how exactly EvoPsych theories actually play out, since we cannot test them. However we can still make an educated guess because we know about the environment our ancestors lived in and behaviors that are beneficial. A man who is okay being cuckolded will not pass on genes very far, while a man who has an aversion to being cucked is more likely to engage in mate guarding, thus ensuring paternity. One of my favorite parts about the "Gender Studies is Nonsense" documentary series on the Red Pill sidebar is when the filmmaker goes to see an evolutionary psychologist and shows her the video of the "gender studies" specialist who says all differences are taught as part of the "social construct." Her reaction is just pure incredulity at the extreme nurture over nature blank slate ideology. Nurture does have an impact, but it is always built on top of existing biology, since you cannot nurture something that is not alive. We should definitely take EvoPsych with some skepticism, but IMO bloopers deny it so forcefully to preserve their worldview that it becomes difficult to take their views seriously. My hypothesis on this topic is that the extremist nurture view is a holdover from the parents of the baby boomers who won WWII against the Nazis. TL;DR
I'm sittin here in front of my house after a smoke sesh with friend he had to take off but not after givin my a dime free:) anyways. I'm here at a [6] getting eatin by Mosquitos.

I met this girl in school about a month ago, got her number and hung out multiple times. We made out multiple times and I told her I liked her but she said to keep things casual. I'm not sure if she likes me or not. Fast forward to last Friday, I sent her home and she texted me thanks and she had fun that day. Afterwards, she told me she's going out to _ . So I texted her "Nice, I love too". I did not receive any replies from her yet. TL;DR
In recent times I've felt my personal thoughts on this have been wavering and I find that frightening, at the same time I can't imagine I'm alone on this and am curious what the overall "feel" other people have been having is. It took some creative thought, and your participation, but I think I figured out a way to conduct a non-formal "reddit Poll". So here's how I've imagined doing this... First off, if you like the idea of this poll becoming successful and garnering as many responses as possible, upvote the post itself to maximize visibility, and hopefully the number of respondents to the poll with it. VOTING IN THE POLL: below you should see the 2 options to the poll in one-word replies made by me.... It's simple, upvote your choice in the poll. Number of upvotes will correlate to the "vote" count. Ideally i'd like for any discussion about your feelings on this subject to be under one of my "vote option" comments , so that the "first level" of comments is nobody but me and the voting options I have placed there. This will hopefully avoid forcing people to search too hard to look for the option they'd like to vote for. TL;DR
At its core working for someone is a contract. The employees of wal-mart agree to the terrible conditions when they sign their contracts. Its called at will employment. It is supposed to be symmetrical because the worker can quit at anytime without legal repercussions and the company can fire them at any time. I won't get into the plethora of reasons this is not symmetrical. With no union to bargain for a better contract these people get the take-it-or-leave it treatment. With a union, you dick over one employee hard enough for the union to take note, and the next thing you have is a strike, without the union all you get is more hiring or lower morale depending on how the employee takes it. TL;DR
So now I'm really confused. Who is in favor of men being allowed to wear dresses? I posted a [negative reaction]( to men wearing dresses which was not well received. Conversely, in this instance, MRAs argue against Daniel Craig dressing in drag in support of international women's day. The community seems to be in favor of traditional masculinity half the time, but favors feminisation and blurring of gender lines the other half. Which is it? TL;DR
Let me start with saying a huge thank you to everyone in this subreddit that replied to my post. Now that the dust has settled a bit, I’m honestly kinda overwhelmed by the number of people that went to huge lengths to tell me about just how serious this situation was/is, deep dived on resources, ect. I got PM’s from people that worked for local and state governments and private agencies that were outside of my state but offered their contacts. I had people that spoke Russian/Ukrainian offering to help contact the Ukrainan Embassy and offered me contact information for Embassy departments. People even contacted us offering money for Tony’s immediate needs in the event we decided to take him in. I’m sincerely touched by the genuine concern all of you had for Tony and his siblings and I hope one day I can tell Tony that despite everything that’s happened, there’s people out there like you guys that care about him. The information you guys gave us helped us act fast and got the ball rolling on this situation faster than me and my boyfriend would’ve figured out alone. I talked with the cops about the situation and honestly? They were just as confused as I was. The person I talked to on the phone was just as stumped but he agreed that at a minimum they did need to do a welfare check. I’ve had experiences with welfare checks before and I had the nagging feeling that something just wouldn’t go right…and someone PM’d me the priority line for my state’s child protective services hotline. I got someone on the phone right away, and as soon as I mentioned that trafficking could be going on and that she was advertising the kid on Facebook (it was a public post here too, people), they acted with a quickness. I gave them all the information I had on Mary and Tony and all the information I had from Mary about Tony’s adoption. The person I spoke to right away said that she suspected that the adoption MIGHT NOT EVEN BE LEGAL. I was floored. I e-mailed all the screenshots I had to the person I spoke with and asked for a followup if that was at all possible. I said that myself and my boyfriend were willing to take Tony on a temporary basis if necessary, but the CPS representative said that likely wasn’t possible. Then, the waiting game began. Last night was probably the most stressful night I’ve ever had- hell at one point, I was ready to drive out to Mary’s house myself but was stopped by my boyfriend. It was tough. The cops followed up with us at approximately 2:00AM. Note that I haven’t heard from CPS. The officer I spoke with was very cautious and limited in what he said, but he told me that CPS arrived at the home shortly after he did. In not so many words, he implied that Mary had been talking to someone about meeting Tony the very next day and that CPS’ suspicions were confirmed— Tony’s adoption was not legal. Tony was rehomed to Mary and her husband from another state where placement needs to be approved by a judge. He didn’t elaborate further except to say that other issues came to light and all of the children were removed from the home for their own safety by CPS. He didn’t say how long they were there, but said it was “a long time”. I was asked to drop off all e-mails and printouts to the station in the morning, and I agreed. My boyfriend and I wanted to make doubly sure that all of our bases were checked, so I called our local FBI office who said they lacked jurisdiction in the matter but would be writing up a complaint and referring the issue to the State Department. We called the Ukrainian Embassy and made a detailed complaint and I included the contact information I had for the officer from the department. The shit really hit the fan when I went into work to printout the e-mail. Our company is pretty small and the company owner, (I’ll call her Big Ange because of her resemblance to the Mob Wives lady) had gotten wind of Mary’s email. Big Ange was FURIOUS, and waiting at Mary’s desk to see if she would show up for work. My friend reported that Big Ange waited from 7:15 - 9:30 AM, and that Mary CAME TO WORK WITH A SOB STORY ABOUT HOW HER KIDS WERE BEING UNFAIRLY TAKEN AWAY! Mary wanted time off from work to “clear her name” and “devote herself to re-claiming her family from this misunderstanding”. I wasn’t there to witness this, but Big Ange, who has six kids herself, apparently ripped Mary a new asshole. Mary has been dismissed and rumor has it that Big Ange may or may not allow her to claim unemployment. My head is honestly still spinning from everything that has happened. The past 24 hours have been insanity. I’m so grateful that the system worked as quickly as it did. I only hope it works out a long term solution to this problem and that Mary doesn’t get to reclaim her kids. My heart is breaking for Tony and the other kids right now…I don’t know what the fuck was happening in Mary’s house that made CPS remove them that night, but I’m going to sleep better knowing that they aren’t with psycho ass Mary and her husband, at least for awhile. What the future holds for Tony and the other kids (especially because Tony’s adoption was apparently illegal) makes me sick…but I’m going to wish for the best. I need a damn drink. TL;DR
My GPA is good, too (but I'm writing this instead of studying for an impending exam so maybe not for long), my best friend from high school has decided to become a pervert (so we've fallen out of contact), my other friends from high school are in a university in another city, the only person I made a meaningful connection with in first year has a crippling League of Legends addiction that prevents me from ever talking to/hanging out with him, and I haven't really gelled with anyone else. I blame being a non-drinker in a de facto relationship who isn't living on a college compounded with a complete lack of interest in any of the clubs/societies on campus as well as my personality and niche interests being incompatible with my peers, but it's actually social anxiety reinforced by past failures preventing me from bothering with meaningful friendships. TL;DR
First, let me say I'm sorry if this is too far off topic. Like I said, I am looking for a very specific type of fitting and I wasn't sure where else to ask. I am building a formicarium for ant keeping. In most formicarium setups you have a nest and an outworld. The nest is where the ants will sleep and raise their young, and the outworld is where they will forage for food and water, collect resources for the nest, and dispose of their trash and dead bodies. These two areas are generally separate containers that are connected by vinyl hose/tubing. The nest I am looking to purchase has two entrances [seen here.]( One is 1/2" in diameter the other 5mm in diameter. The outworld I am looking to purchase comes from a different company. It is essentially a glass box with several holes cut with both a 27mm diameter and a 13mm diameter. The company that sells the outworld happens to sell a really nifty connector that screws against the glass with a nut and has what sounds like a variable diameter port for the hose to connect to. I don't know if variable is the correct term, but the product page on their website states that it will accept 10mm to 16mm tubing, which the 1/2" hole on the nest happens to fall into. [Here is a picture of the fitting.]( [And here is a picture of the fitting in use.]( And here is the product page selling the fitting. So as far as I understand things, this connector will accept a hose between 10mm and 16mm. The larger opening in the nest in 1/2" which falls right in the middle of 10mm and 16mm so this should work fine. Now the problem is the smaller opening in the nest. It's 5mm and the smaller hole in the outworld is 13mm. The company that manufactures the outworld does not sell any sort of adapter for the 13mm hole. [Here is a diagram I've made to give you all a better idea of what I am trying to do.]( I posted a picture of that white connector to /r/whatisthisthing and got a pretty quick response telling me it's a "male PVC compression adapter". That appears to be correct, but there are a couple of problems. I figure 13mm is on the right side of 1/2", but when I find these adapters with a 1/2" male end, they seem to go the other way. By that I mean the male end will be 1/2", but the tubing diameter it accepts is usually like 3/4". It makes sense as it is a "compression" adapter. I've also noticed that these adapters don't seem to have a range of tubing diameter they accept like the one I linked earlier. There is probably no way I am going to find a 1/2" to 5mm adapter so I really was hoping to find something like a 1/2" adapter that accepts 1/8" - 1/4" tubing. The best candidate I've found so far is this . I could probably think of a dozen ways to jerry-rig this thing together, but I want it to look nice and I'd like to find a similar fitting to the one offered on that website. TL;DR
Technically, I'm an IT spec / Journalist, so first and foremost I use it for a lot of mundane computer stuff. On top of that the system handles video editing and work with large data libraries just fine, and there is the occasional game session. TL;DR
Then it is misclassified, because it should be the Philosophy of neuroscience of free will, and not neuroscience of free will. Thats why the specialization exists. Thats why its a wiki, and not an actual educational class at Harvard, Oxford, etc. This is miss classification at its best. Science has no capability whatsoever to define itself, nor can it define ethics, morals, or metaphysical laws. Point in Case. This has been known since the 14th century, Hume and and onwards. If there was any news that somehow broken tradition with Hume's prior arguments, it would be largely discussed in the academic society. I'm glad you brought this up though, because its important to correct such miss classifications since they're mostly a result of post-modernism rather than rightly within the thought process of Analytical Philosophy. You should probably do some research on specific sects of philosophy, and probably read some Hume as well; maybe read up on some people who actually know what they're talking about and avoid Sam Harris. His book on the moral landscape was already butchered by both atheist and theistic philosophers alike for falling prey to Hume's is and is ought theory. I still think this is a troll; any person in academia wouldn't make such a comment lest be smashed to ribbons by their philosophical peers. TL;DR
Shit man, i do this with games too. I bought mgs4 on day one, played for like 30 minutes and never touched it again, traded it for fallout3, played for like 1 hour and that's it. Bought the orange box, played ep1 for a little bit and that's it. Played two levels of portal, a little tf2 but never played again. Bought sly cooper 2 because i loved the first one, it's sitting there collecting dust. Shadow of the colossus, i managed to get up to the 10th boss after two years. A big part of the problem is Cod4, it ruined every other game for me, that's all i play, And sf hd remix. I have lost my patience to play campaign modes in games, i'd rather just shoot and knife people. TL;DR

So I partially understand when people are kinda stressed in HL and that the occasional Gazlowe and Nova mains are a bit frowned upon. When playing HL, I really try my best to win, including the draft and even if that means I won't get to play the hero I wanted to play. But in UNRANKED there is literally nothing at stake. So can we please use this format to have some relaxed and fun games? Sentences like "oh god 2 spec nice troll pick" don't make any sense in the first place and even less so in unranked. I'd honestly rather try a 5 spec comp than playing Kael/E.T.C./Rehgar yet again - I already saw the latter in HL a few times, I believe. If you are not so confident about the draft, that is your chance to see if and how you can make it work - without the risk of losing anything if it doesn't! :) First pick Nova? In HL, I'd say: Meh. In unranked however, the question should be: What can we do to make that work? So we need wave clear and maybe quite a bit poke so that Nova can roam around and kill people? Which ban will support this slightly suboptimal choice? Use those weird picks to get experience with bad comps, you can capitalize on that later. When you encounter the pesky Nova main in HL later, you might know what to do and might have a shot at winning despite not getting matched with the Korean pro team you deserve to get matched with. And ffs, don't ban the pre pick of your own team just because you don't agree with them. That just does not achieve anything. If you see me pre picking a Hero you are not too sure about, you are right: In unranked, I test heroes I am not confident with. I have a brief list of heroes I want to play, but won't do so in HL because I'm not good with them yet. So I go to unranked and pick the best of my 'bad' heroes to improve. Ban that one and you get another one that's even worse. Yes, you can stop me from playing Abathur (because he is totally not good on Cursed Hollow), but you can't force me to play Kael/E.T.C./Rehgar. Here, have a level 1 Chromie instead. TL;DR
Hey guys, I'm working on a new website as a spring break project for fun and need your help. I've been playing since last summer and only recently also got into disc collecting/trading/hoarding. If you're like me though, When you're looking to buy something you usually just google it to find a store that is near by and you can usually find what you are looking for. Searching for local disc golf stores though is not that simple. I have found so many small stores that carry discs but do not actively promote it or list it on their websites/social media. I often find the best deals, best discs, and friendly service at these smaller stores compared to Dick's or Sports Authority. So i've been working with a few friends to make a website where you can search by name, city, state, or zip code to find stores that sell disc golf gear near you. We're giving info on the company, pictures of the store and stock, and a list of discs they carry. We're looking into more features but really want to focus on the important info first. For example, If you're from the Portland area and play Lunchtime disc golf course there is a small tobacco shop less than a mile away that stocks mostly Innova and Trilogy plastic. I've found some sweet OOP Star plastic discs for $11 each and i was given the fourth one free after buying three discs! I stopped by there out of curiosity after seeing a small Innova banner near their window. Without that banner I would have had no idea that they sold discs in there since they dont come up when i type "Oregon disc golf stores" into google. I will be posting a link to the site later this week and asking for site feedback but I right now I need your help now getting a list of local stores or places you buy discs. If you give me a store name and city/state I can probably find them with some facebook and search engine help. PM me if you want the website URL. It's pretty bare and ugly right now but if anyone wants to try it out while we work on it you're more than welcome to. Thanks TL;DR
When I was younger, I remember my dad telling me how my mom had been through a lot in her life, but the only detail he really brought up was that she had been abandoned in the desert as a child and to not bring it up with her. I listened to him, and even at a young age, I knew it was something I'd find out when or if she was ready to talk about it. Many years later, I've finally finished high school and am soon moving out for college. I was having a long chat with my mom about all kinds of things, and she starts telling me more about her childhood. Turns out, she had a neglectful and abusive father. He didn't hurt my mom or her sister, but he assaulted my grandma and one day, he came close to killing her. She was able to run away before that happened, but couldn't get her kids, so they were stuck with their father. Then, one night, he takes my 8 year old mom, her younger sister, and their cousin out to a very remote area of a large desert, in California I believe, and just drives off, leaving them to die. The cousin was older than the other two, so he guided them the best he could back to civilization. They lived off cactus, but came close to dying. They somehow made it back, but I honestly can't remember how, and I think she doesn't really know either. After that, they tried to get back to their mother, but she had become homeless and they couldn't find her. Their mother also couldn't find her children, but she had no way to provide for them. So, my mom and my aunt both ended up in foster care. My mother has a disjointed memory about one of these foster homes about being huddled in a closet while eating a box of Nilla Wafers. She heard screaming and saw "bad stuff on the walls", which I can only assume to be blood. My mom struggled with telling this part, and she told me herself that she's forgotten details because she thinks it's mostly a repressed memory. Her and her sister jumped foster homes a lot, until they finally reconnected with their mother, who had found housing with family and a job to support herself. For a long time, I thought my grandma had been sort of the "bad guy", because I didn't know why she'd ever let her children be abandoned. Once I heard the full story, I realized my grandma cared very much for her children and how much it devastated her for that to ever have occurred. My grandma now has dementia which is rapidly becoming worse, but she's lived a long 80+ years, and her latest husband took her on many adventures to all parts of the country before he passed away at the age of 96. TL;DR
I'd say it's less personal and more institutional. The law is written so that the agency involved collects money whenever it can because otherwise handing out support payments would become a huge drain on the state. The people who wrote the law don't want revenue streams they will use for other purposes impacted by little things like unwed mothers and deadbeat dads so the law is written in sloppy fashion to let the agencies collect. TL;DR
Hello! My friend and I have been trying to find a place to settle down. Currently we're thinking about Governor's Retreat, the empty housing plot by I4, or a random location on the outskirts of the map. Most people suggest to not build bases by looting locations so I'm iffy about Governor's Retreat and the I4 location. If anyone has any advice or suggestions it would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!

He is nominally a bail bondsman in the loosest sense that he has a license. He is also an idiot who is lucky that he is on an island in the middle of the Pacific which makes it harder for people to leave to even go to another Hawaiian island. It also depends on the state law as to who and how you are allowed to recapture fugitives. I call him an idiot because while he many nominally have the right to do it how he does, he does it in a stupid way and opens himself up to a big chance of civil and possibly criminal liability. [He was once charged for illegally arresting someone in Mexico]( Even a half way decent bail bondsman or bounty hunter would check and even alert law enforcement if they were arresting someone outside of their state. Plus they would know that it is illegal in almost every country in the world to make such an arrest. Even several states, Oregon for one, don't allow a bondsman to pick up a skip or they consider it kidnapping. This even includes driving to the state, the skip getting into the car willingly, then driving back to where the bond was issued. Other states don's allow extradition to certain states, but also don't allow you to pick them up like in Oregon. The bounty hunting law that most bounty hunters and bail bondsmen use for their justification is a [Supreme Court case from 1872]( You don't want to be doing things relying on a case that is over 100 years old as your only safety margin. The bail bondsman or bounty hunter (depending on whether or not the state allows bounty hunters) has a limited time to bring the person into custody in the jurisdiction where the bond was set. The bondsman typically doesn't actually pay the money to the court, at least in my experience, until after this time has elapsed. As to the bounty hunter, typically the award is the fee that the bondsman was paid for the bond, which on average is 10% of the face amount of the bond ($100,000 bond would pay $10,000 fee). This means that while the bondsman may not make any money, he doesn't lose money either. Now, most states, but not all, allow and almost encourage the use of surety companies which are just insurance companies. What happens here is that if the person skips and is not brought in to court in time, the county/state (I haven't had experience with federal because the rules tend to be much stricter and defaults can occur even if the person goes to court) goes to the insurance company. Then the insurance company gets seeks indemnity from the bondsman. The bondsman then seeks indemnity from the co-signor and/or bonded person. One of the ways that these insurance companies protect themselves is require a substantial deposit by the bondsman before allowing them to write, a pledging of assets with a security agreement, to write. They also typically charge somewhere between 3-10% of the fee charged to be placed in a build up fund. This fund is controlled by the insurer, and is used to pay for forfeitures if they occur. Now some bonds are far better than others, so it depends on the specific case. Sometimes the person has money and/or property and the bondsman can be reimbursed. Many times however, the person is getting a bail bondsman rather than paying the fee itself because they can't afford to pledge the full face value of the bond. Again, this applies to my experience, I am not sure if some states don't allow personal bonding and require the use of a bondsman. So your odds of getting the money back are fairly slim. Before, sometimes the bondsman could negotiate a reduction in the amount owed if the person failed to go to court. Lately though with all the budget problems, this is not happening at all and the courts are requiring full face value reimbursement. In my state, what happens when a forfeiture is paid, the prosecutors office gets 25%, the municipality that made the arrest gets, the county gets 25%, and the state gets 25%. It can change depending on the exact crime and type, but for the most part this is a good rule of thumb. Therefore, they have an incentive to get as much as possible. So basically, your bail bondsman is more of a risk assessor and insurance agent than someone who goes and hunts down people. Hope this answers your questions, but if not, please feel to ask me any more you have or need clarification on any points. TL;DR
I'm currently dating an amazing girl, but she is struggling with depression, self harm, and suicidal thoughts. She tells me that her dad won't accept that shes hurt and needs help, that she's tried to tell him different ways but he doesn't get it. He thinks shes just being over dramatic at times. I tried to sit down and talk to him about getting her help possibly through a therapist, but he said that he would have to talk to her mom and her about it and see, and that ultimately she has to look to god. It's been over a week now and she doesn't think he will ever do anything about it. I never told him that shes depressed, self harming, and occasionally taking multiple pain meds at a time to "mellow out" but I'm worried shes trying to overdose. I only told him that she is "sad" and she really needs to see a therapist, and that I wouldn't go into details with him because I didn't want to break her trust. I would've said depressed and suicidal, but he came off as offended and taken aback that I could know something about his daughter that he doesn't know. I couldn't find the way to tell him she's suicidal, he wouldn't have taken it well i'm for sure, the way he is, he would've been mad at me and her, and possibly made her go over the edge. I don't know what to do. She has cut herself for the past four nights in a row, and taken multiple pain meds to try to calm down/overdose. I go to sleep not knowing if she will wake up and text me back. It's really really hard and I need help. I tell her every day how much I love her and how i'll always be here for her. She tells me everyday is harder and harder to get up everyday, and she doesn't want to be alive anymore. She told me that i'm the only reason she still tries just a little bit (not in a clingy "I'll kill myself if you leave" but like "You mean so much to me that I haven't fully given up yet") TL;DR
I think i may have a symptom of social anxiety, where i laugh at things that aren't funny, however mostly, if I'm by myself i can stay easily composed. Firstly, i don't mean laughing as in laughing out loud, more of the shaking kind of laugh thats quiet. For example, if i was listening to a coir with friends or family around me (people i knew), and someones voice broke, i would quietly laugh. But sometimes i can't stop laughing, like for minutes i stop and then start again. This is amplified if a friend was to laugh as well, because i would keep laughing as long as there laughing. Another example has occurred when i had to read something out load in class and if i found something funny, i would kind laugh and it my voice would be shaky. This is one example that i think links to social anxiety, because reading out loud can be an uncomfortable task. Now, the worst situation that i laugh in is one thats situated around bad news or a tragedy. If someone told me that a child died or someone i knew or had met died, i would generally feel bad. However, if the tragedy is about someone that i have never met and have no feelings for, then I'm more prone to laughing. Its kind of like i have an empathy gap. An example would be, if a friend told me there friends mother died in a car car crash (this hasn't happened btw). The way they explain it is something that would get to me, almost because i feel like my response is fake. I'm not a person that laughs at anything so this is why i think behaviour is odd. If i could stop this behaviour then i would, and I'm afraid it may affect me in the future. TL;DR
I was on the fence too about which was better. My dad always told me to buy a house as soon as I could afford it because renting was throwing money away. I did my research and did eventually buy a house but not before learning that I'm throwing plenty of money away in that route as well. My house here in NY was 275,000 for 2100 square feet and was new construction. Closing costs ran me about 10,000 (not including the downpayment) and each year I pay about 300 more in homeowners insurance than renters insurance and about 8000 in property taxes that I really don't see much of back in my taxes because I don't have enough other expenses. (everyone told me I'd get back 1/4 of my interest and property taxes but that just hasn't seemed to be the case) So I'm paying about 8000 a year plus right now in interest I'm losing about 700 a month in interest (3.875% interest rate). So over these first 3 years in my house I will on average spent about 15,000 a year that I don't see back. The rent in the same town for a nice apartment that is half the size of my house and no yard is 1200 so there I would spend about 14400. About the same amount out of pocket that is just lost. I don't take the calculations of the mortgage payment that actually goes toward the principal into account here because that is actually money that is just in a way being saved that I will get back when I sell the house one day. TL;DR
Those accu-check things are only to see if you're PISSING ketones, not whether you're ketogenic. The correlation is good for newbies, but poor for "veterans". After a few weeks/months you should be keto-adapted, which effectively means your body uses basically all the ketone bodies it produces. Early on your body produces excess ketones, this is what newbies call ketosis whereas it's actually ketonuria - ie your body discarding ketones because it hasn't established the required mechanisms to use them appropriately yet. If you want to know for sure, get a blood monitor - but FWIW after a while you just know whether you're ketogenic by the general feeling you have. TL;DR
When I was in high school my parents (mom) would wake me up at 5:15 every morning to get to school by 7, because she knew I would go back to sleep and would wake me back up in 30 minutes, when I would ACTUALLY get up and ready. I have the same habit now that I'm away at college. I always wake myself up 2 hours before any class to make sure that I have all my work, catch up on anything I forgot, or just to make sure I get to class on time (haven't been late or missed a class once this semester). It's weird that it stuck with me even after I left. TL;DR
My boyfriend and I are 20, and we've been dating for 11 months. I don't know what to do. I hate concerts. To not only have a hard case of ADD and social anxiety stemming from my incredibly terrible case of depression, i hate going. I like music, but I'm small. People step on me, people hit me, push me, and i cant even see anything. So a typical concert consists of me getting hit in the face, stepped on, and staring at the back of someone's shirt. I don't understand how people enjoy themselves and are dancing, and i don't. It seems weird and unnatural. And i feel depressed because everyone has a good time and i cant. My boyfriend loves concerts. The first one, i got sick. Despite me always telling him to stay, he makes me leave and he gets all sad and cries afterwards. The second time, he made me try ecstasy, and i freaked out, and again.... We left. I told him I'd be okay and for us to stay and that i just needed to sit for a bit because the crowd was scaring me, but he made me leave. Again, he cried. The third concert, i got sick, but we stayed. Mainly because i didn't tell him i was sick afterwards and left to take care of my sickness when i went to the bathroom and held the dying pain the entire time. Friday night, i got elbowed in the eye. The main guy came on, and it caused me to cry (from pain) and have a panic attack. I tried to hide it and just stay there till it passed. My boyfriend turned me around to ask if i could see; and saw me tearing up. (I cant hide my emotions. It's too difficult. ) and then he's put in a bad mood, and keeps trying to get me to leave so we can go home, while i stay put and say no. I try to dance with him, while trying to calm down, and he got so angry he starts yelling, and finally we go home. I didn't want to leave because again i fuck up. We went home and he cried because he really wanted to see the guy. Every concert we go to, he always really wants to see them. I have no interest in concerts. Even if i like that person too, i don't really care. He doesn't want to take someone else or go alone. So i go. When I feel sick, he won't stay. He makes me leave even if I can go home alone by myself so he can enjoy himself. And again i feel like shit. I try to stick it out for him, and i feel like a huge disappointment. He then starts crying and saying i need to calm down and to try to not be so negative all the time. LIKE I HAVE A CHOICE. I WISH I COULD BE HAPPY. And i finally felt alone. I feel truly alone because I thought he understood I can't just turn on my happiness. I got very depressed and suicidal and felt the need to self harm. I normally don't get that bad. Since then he has been very cold towards me but still demanding attention from me. I don't know what to do. He wants me to go to another concert in two weeks....I don't even know if we are still going. He doesn't talk, he doesn't want me to take him out or do anything fun. I am still incredibly depressed. I feel terrible. I feel worthless and a disappointment. I guess since he's at my apartment still, it's not as bad. He has his own apartment but stays at mine all the time. I'm really depressed. He's the only person besides family who knows im depressed and I can't even talk to him. People just think I'm really shy. He just wants me to comfort him, cuddle him, but does nothing for me. I'm sad too. I guess I deserve to feel this way, but I can't help but feel like things are going to end. I hate waiting around because I'd rather be dumped already and get on with the pain instead of being paranoid and waiting for it. I can't talk to him about it because he just gets depressed and cries again. I'm going home after my exams this week to get away and havent told him. And before anyone mentions I need to seek help, I've tried. I was going somewhere on campus, and they put me on 7 or 8 anti depressants that didn't work, and the last one gave me seizures. I ended up in the hospital and broke my nose. I went back and told her what happened, and she said the medication DOESNT cause it. (IT DOES.) and i went back on, only to have a seizure again, and almost bleed to death. (I called the campus nurse and she told me to let me bleed it out, after i told her I was bleeding out cups, and i eventually just called 911 before i passed out) i went a few weeks back when I heard that doctor had left, but since they had already "helped me" they can't take me again. I'm currently trying to find a doctor nearby where it'll take my insurance and is close by. TL;DR
Ok then 1) God has no origin because I explained earlier that God existed in a time before time. I explained that when he spawned light he also spawned time, however that light was also accompanied by heat and kinetic energy (since photons are particles that technically have mass), also it is entirely possible that other subatomic particles could accompany the light. The fCt remains that God would have no way to explain to early jews what the hell a "sub-atomic particle is. 2) the bible may be interpreted in different ways depending on how each individual views the world. That occurs with any text and denominations are born mostly due to a single churches take on the scripture and churches often fuse tradition with religion. That is partially why I am non-denominational. 3) In abiogenesis scientists have been able to synthesis organic compounds, but actually creating life is far more complex than even humans can achieve even under the perfect conditions. That is like nature making a car out of car parts. Everything would have to be perfect in order for even the most basic microbe to spawn and even then it wouldn't guarantee survival in the barren wasteland that was primordial earth. Life is very fragile until it gets established, and the early cells would have needed a food source and a safe environment in order to survive. That would require the cell to contain the DNA/RNA to synthesis the necessary chemicals to be able to metabolize a certain food source; something that would be almost impossible for extremely basic DNA/RNA. 4) You talk about rapid evolution and used dogs as an example, however it is actually a repeating sequence of letters that allow dogs to be able to drastically change their shape. If fact all dogs are virtually genetically identical and dogs are also so closely related to wolves that the two can mare without any ill effects to the offspring genetically. 5) the Noah's ark theory is something I originally thought of. You talk about the negative consequences of inbreeding yet all throughout the fossil record examples of excessive inbreeding can be observed especially after mass extinctions. In fact all the modern wild pigs in America descended from just a dozen or so animals that escaped from the Spanish and into Florida. Also, I am a firm believer in micro-evolution, and the Hawthorn fly is actually the perfect example of what I think evolution is based off of Behavioral, Geographical, and Temporal isolation due to adaptive radiation. I never claimed all evolution was wrong; I simply pointed out that certain aspects of macro evolution are more "wishful thinking" than fact. TL;DR
Well let's hit this one by one, and we'll talk about each one individually. 1: where is it stated that this is a tea party member? Was this sponsored by a candidate? Who? 2: in context of congress being called slave owners, wouldn't "Niggar" be a contextually correct? That's what slaves were referred to at the time. I believe "slave"would have been a better choice, but it definitely had an attention grabbing aspect. For one, you're using it years later. Yet again I'd like to see a candidate that sponsored this individual. 3: yet again, where is this stated to be tea party? And, which candidate sponsored this sticker? 4: who is this fellow carrying this sign? Yet again, is that a candidate? Or even better, what happened to this individual after this photo was taken? Was he allowed to stay, or was he confronted? TL;DR
It seems to me that killing a lifeform is the most extreme form of suffering which can be inflicted on that lifeform - thereby ending all its future experience. The 'wrongness' of killing a healthy chicken does not stem from that fact that the chicken might suffer or anticipate it (the 'wrongness' would still exist if the chicken were instantly vapourised Dr. Manhattan style - or expertly slaughtered) but rather, as you posted elsewhere: >You would have to believe that animal experiences are not experiences worthy of proper respect - meaning that you can end their experiences at any time without remorse. Plants are "just as alive" as animals, maggots, or anything else living. 'Where we draw the somewhat arbitrary line between things we can kill in good conscious and things we cannot' is due to anthropocentric assessment of non-human experiences and how killing the lifeform makes us feel (e.g narcissism). How else do vegetarian's justify ending a plant's or fungi's or fish's or squid's life in good conscience? If I were to personally raise animals for food, I might feel more remorse when I ate their dead bodies. By seeing (or believing that I understand) more of their experience, it might be more difficult to assess them as not being worthy of respect. But, that would not - as my ownership of the animals demonstrates - mean that the animals are worthy of human-like respect. The amount of remorse that one feel's is subjective. I might feel worse about cutting the head off the Mona Lisa, than cutting the head off a chicken, than squashing some bugs, than bleaching my toilet. The amount of remorse I feel does not correlate with the amount of life that is destroyed. So, to tweak what you said: Animal experiences are not experiences worthy of human-experience-like respect. Unlike humans, animals are a commodity. They may be justifiably owned, traded, ridden, caged, caught, killed and eaten without remorse for the animal, although remorse may be a understandable reaction. TL;DR
I'm really flat chested so much so I can get away with no bra as my boobs practically don't exist and I love it. I am not flat-chested, but sometimes I actually wish that I were more flat-chested just so that I could feel more comfortable in my own skin. TL;DR
Not including Chaurus that is. I write this because I started a new game the other day, and as often happens when you have a lot of mods installed, small things can start to go awry, triggering other things. So anyway, we're riding the carriages down the mountain to be executed, only, something goes wrong, we're going too fast! The First carriage crashes into General Tullius, slamming him, and his horse, into the wall of the tower. My Carriage, ran into the tangle, hit something and leapt onto two wheels, almost tipping over but not quite, we threaded the needle through the melee and made it into the courtyard first. TL;DR
I thought I'd add this comment which may help. The Sub isn't about POUNDING out bass frequencies, although it does do this. It's more about the cross over between small speakers that simply cannot reproduce low frequencies and larger speakers that can. What you are buying is not a 'bass cannon' but detail. If you listen to older music, (I'm guessing) it was mastered for people who predominantly didn't have access to decent home entertainment and while there's a difference it's not as stark. Listening to more recent music the difference is astounding. TL;DR
First off, he's super dope. This guy was everywhere doing everything. Casting, helping in the booth, helping with the side computers, running around the venue dealing with specific problems, signing autographs, I even saw him earlier this weekend go on a food run. All of which joking around and laughing and overall having a fantastic time. Since the Red Bull Lan was so empty it had a almost intimate atmosphere to it and it seemed like we were constantly getting treated with a little Rob here and there. The great part was being able to actually watch Rob cast. Listening to him and watching a game is awesome, hes a great overall caster. But anyone who was at the lan can vouch for me that watching and listening to Rob as he casts is down right side splitting. His facial expressions, hand gestures, interaction with the crowd, and especially the way Day9 and him interact with each other as the game is progressing is something you can really only get the full grasp of if you were there. IDK if you'll see this Rob but you were awesome!!! I got your autograph and your girlfriend dubbed me "TheLoudestGuyAtTheVenue" so Thanks for making the RBLAN even more awesome!!! TL;DR
I am in Silver 1 and really trying to get to Gold but it is even harder whenever people simply quit due to some people talking to you in a "rude" way. It's the internet! I won't sugarcoat this and I will say that sometimes I'm that person that tells you, "Dude seriously, dont try 1v5 the team, have some map awareness ffs". Then, let's say in this scenario, the person gets butthurt and says something along the lines of "I'm not having fun anymore, just gonna feed, f*** this trash team", when we were only 5-12 (We could still comeback). In the end, if the person is harassing you, there is always an ignore button (Of course there is a fine line between telling you what to do in a "rude" way and actually bullying you). Another subject is when jungler takes blue from an 0-4 mid, obviously, the mid will just feed it to the enemy mid and keep matters worse but what does our mid do when this happens? "Omg, jungler didnt give me blue gg afk". Just bothers me that people wont take ranked as seriously as I do and simply give up or quit when things look rough. TL;DR
Thanks for the replies, even though there wasnt that many, it was nice to see people wanting to help out. Again, sorry for the wall of text, a lot has happened over the holidays. Here's the original post about the situation: My sister and brother visited the family home over the holidays and in short, Christmas was a disaster. Petty arguments, pissing eachother off - tension was high. And my little sister was oblivious to the root of the problem, but managed through it as its a pretty normal dynamic in my family. To make matters worse, my mother royally fucked up by casually telling my sister IN A CAR JOURNEY HOME, that herself and my father are splitting up. My little sister just sat beside me on the couch and said gently; "mom told me about her and dad. I just find it hard to picture". She was in shock. I am sorry to say but I lost the plot and started shouting at my mother that she fucked up and we should have told Jenny as a family, and that nothing should have been said until concrete arrangements had been made, because the house is chaotic. She just screamed back that Jenny is her daughter and I shouldn't tell her how to parent her own child. I couldn't argue with her and I was too angry. Eventually, through the advice of my older sister (who I showed this thread), my mother is moving out to a house just down the road from our family home. Literally a 2 minute walk. I don't know how this will work out. Obviously it'll be good not to have her and my dad around eachother and arguing, but I just have a feeling she will come back to the house all the time for supplies and "her stuff". She has also stated that Jenny will be spending one week at "hers" and one week at the family home with my dad. I personally feel this is too much too soon and that they should get a proper mediator to sort this out, but they won't listen. This is such a crappy update but basically stuff has happened but it's not resolved yet. I have hope but I know it's not going to be easy. Having your parents constantly crying and bringing up the broken remains of the relationship isn't nice but I'm glad I can be there for Jenny. TL;DR
Last week, after a near-successful escape attempt from a busted tank, my rosy boa Hotwheels escaped successfully from one of the better safety tanks. I cried, and was convinced that we wouldn't find him. There was no way. He was small enough to escape the maximum security prison tank, then he probably made it outside through a gap in the floor... So, after carefully reading and judging, and getting opinions, I picked up a ball python, Beatrix. She's too big to escape the same way he had, and has mostly shown interest in sunning herself from her tree. I thought about Hotwheels every night, and hoped he had made it to Florida to eat alligators, just like a big snake... Then, this morning, my mom woke me up saying MOTHER FUCKING HOTWHEELS WAS IN THE BATHROOM . I quickly picked up the little bastard, who quickly musked me in return. I deposited him into his old (broke) tank, and did some quick patches while my mom and I left to pick up some more snake equipment for him. Now, I have two snakes...and love them both. However, when my boyfriend comes to live in the south this summer, I will be passing Hotwheels onto him. He's cool with this, and is actually really excited, but knows that I still love the shit out of that little orange guy. TL;DR
Between 2003 and 2009 I lived in a big urban city and went to a really great university. I started a student group with a bunch of my friends and made some new friends as the group got up and running. Over the years I became very close with these friends, met their families, spent vacations with them, was best man at a wedding, loaned them significant amounts of money, lived with some of them, and partied with them way too hard. The partying lifestyle got the better of me and I started messing up in my classes, and in 2009 I decided to transfer to an easier university closer to home about a 5 hour drive away. I always thought that these people would be my friends for life and we often joked and talked about all of us growing old together. Since I moved my relationship with them has changed dramatically. When I first moved I was pretty broken up over having to leave what had come to be home to me and I didn't put much effort into keeping in touch. Neither did they, which made me want to keep in touch even less. After I started at my new university I stared to feel better and made more of an effort to reconnect. I called and texted, but rarely if at all did I get a response. In 2010 they made their only trip up to see me for a day. It was really great to see them, I showed them around my new town, went out to a great dinner, and did some drinking and reminiscing. I have made almost 10 trips down to see them since that have been fun trips, but things aren't quite the same, there is an awkwardness and an unfamiliarity between us that wasn't there before. I recently finished earning my degree and got a great job, which pays well and allows me to take weekend trips to visit them. I visited them twice over the last two months and had a pretty great time. I finally felt confident around them, they are all successful and educated so I was finally starting to catch up with them! It also felt less awkward! What a relief! The problem is, besides the trips I took and the messages about the trip, they haven't reached out at all. No happy thanksgiving, christmas, new years. I know the holidays are busy for everybody, but I thought I would have at least heard from them a little. I'm ready to stop trying, but I want to make sure I'm not being unreasonable. My main issues are that they never made a real effort to keep in touch when I left the area. I thought my friends that encouraged and enabled my partying while I was struggling in uni would be the ones to support me when I finally got my act together. I feel like chump for continuing to hold on to these old friendships when I don't get any type of commuication or acknowledgement in return. Now that I'm finally done with uni and working my way up the corporate ladder I thought we would all be able to reconnect considering we are all once again in similar points in our lives, but it's still not happening. When is it time to just let the friendships fade away? TL;DR
I'm not in the military either, but let me offer this perspective: It is not entirely unreasonable to refuse to delegate to the civilian government the responsibility of determining who your enemies are, or to feel that the government is too compromised by politics and ideology to appropriately assess and respond to threats to our nation. Both of these positions have flaws, but I don't believe that they necessarily carry a lack of respect for the military. I can even see how they could be fair reasons for deciding not to enlist. However , deciding whether or not to enlist based on how one administration responded to a single event is myopic. If you're going to consider serving our country via the military, you should have some idea of the fact that situations and administrations change, and that enlisting -- even in peacetime -- requires that you accept a wide range of possible civilian governments and their likely responses to unforeseeable situations. The notion that it's fair to decide whether or not to serve based on Bush's actions alone does suggest a lack of respect for the military, in that it belies a lack of understanding of why a thoughtful person might enlist despite political misgivings. Not everyone who enlisted in the wake of 9/11 accepted Bush's idea of the role of the military, and not everyone enlisting today accepts Obama's. I won't be so presumptuous as to try to pigeonhole what motivates those who enlist despite not necessarily agreeing with the civilian government; I am not one of them. I'm hopeful that some who serve will see this and offer their viewpoints. TL;DR
