Your theory sounds solid enough. Use your ear. Do some playing, and some wild improvising, and you'll begin to see things clearer. Above all, think of each sound that comes from your instrument as beautiful while beginning your practice session, and throughout. P.S. If you're old enough, and choose to, try having a beer before playing a tune or improvising. I've found it an interesting experiment. P.P.S. Buy Kenny Werner's book Effortless Mastery . It's helped me cut the crap out of my music-doing.

Catching up with a friend for drinks who I have had a sexual past with (non-romantic), do I tell my SO about our history? Or is it a need to know basis and he doesn't need to know? EDIT: If I was going to bring it up, how would I do it without it seeming totally random? (I am over thinking this!)

Try to change something in the past that has little-to-no effect on the current timeline so that upon return to the present, nothing would have changed except the size of your bank/stock/whatever account.
but I guess I could have left it out. So if you want to put the blame on me I'm okay with that, just don't bring it up anymore the situation is over. I'm taking responsibility no one else in the teams fault. If you want to have a civilized discussion on mumble ill be on tonight so feel free to find me, otherwise lets just drop this, because it is truly a pointless discussion and I have come out as taking the blame. Thanks, Dr. Dodge

Boyfriend's mom has been having a midlife crisis for the last 3-4 years and wants to be our drinking buddy and supermom all at once. She is intrusive and clingy and I can't get my bf to set boundaries without being accused of trying to break him and his mom up forever. Need to know if I'm being unreasonable, and how to approach this problem.

I hate to burst your bubble, but this isn't as big as you think. They already streamed TI4 via ESPN 3. They aren't giving us a shot. They have nothing to lose by streaming Worlds on ESPN 3 because most people aren't even aware it exists. They just wanted attention. They don't care about eSports. They don't care about its development. BTW, they had an International 4 preview show ACTUALLY ON TV. It was on ESPN. The real channel. They aren't even giving us that

make sure you cover yourself should your moving map fail. (Dead iPad, GPS database error, etc..) Edit: Should add: I have taken a year off of flying due to school, and I cannot remember if you need to check your VOR receivers before using them for a VFR flight, ( I know IFR flights req VOR receiver checks within past 30 days) not to mention some VOR's are NOTAM'd unusable between certain radials and altitudes, those are a few other things to consider before you decide "meh, ill just track VORs."
Is there a good tutorial on learning the Blender interface? EDIT: /u/NeoRoshi 's tips helped a bit, but now I'm stuck on another extremely simple task. I need to get the File Menu back so that I can save and export. I have searched through every view, but after switching off the File Menu, it appears to be gone permanently, unless there is a hidden keyboard shortcut. EDIT 2: Found it inside the Info Header

I do not support Legacy. You can say, I am negative, but considering the fact Legacy=/=Pre-EoC, it won't bring back much players, and just screw the combat system. Don' get me wrong, I love both new and old combat, but Jagex just beating the dead horse with Legacy. Feel free to downvote me, IDC.

the employees executing the trades and manipulating markets likely will go to jail while the employer will probably pay a big fine. Edit: Just to clarify some points, fines may only be imposed on provable manipulated trades. This reduces the scope of fines pretty significantly from the "billions and billions" people expect when you factor in that it can only be imposed on profits relating to the manipulation. So yes, LIBOR affected a lot of people, and ton's of money, but there is no law that says they can get retribution for everyone. It would be very similar to a trader manipulating Apple through a "rumor." Apple is a huge chunk of the S&amp;amp;P, so everyone who owns a 401k that is invested in the S&amp;amp;P 500 is affected. However, the SEC can't charge the individual or firm for the losses relating to those, essentially, derivative transactions. Also, not saying any of this is right or wrong, just how it is.

I'm a big religious baby and told my wife I have a porn addiction. i love you guys. edit some of you have asked if she let me back in the bedroom and how things are going. She said she has to think about it. And she deserves that because I've said and done some stupid hurtful things in the past. The true victory here is I was able to realize that and get past my pride. I started out thinking "i'm not coming back until she asks me back." That kind of thinking is what got me in a broken relationship in the first place. i've also learned alot about love. I used to think to love someone they had to love me back. That has changed in me. love is not about what you get. love is about what you give. I love my wife and I want to give her a husband who can be there sexually and isn't all hopped up on dopamine looking at porno. Also, love is an action. Every time i'm able to show her that i love her, it may take some time, but most of the time she eventually reciprocates some love back to me. anyways, thank you all for your kind words and I wish you luck in fighting the good fight!

THEY lied to us. THEY (point somewhere) want us to believe that all their rules and commandments were sent down from God (point up) when in reality (point down) they were written to oppress the people and blame their parents' sins for their own suffering. Mommy, why do we suffer? Oh, it's sin. It's not political oppression, it's not ignorance of medicine, it's not genetic defects or viruses, it's because our parents sinned. Easy explanation, nobody wants to find out anything. The people are content, and the priests and the king win.

Girl told me she's not looking for relationship because she's going off to college, senior year, no worries. Told me "if I wasn't going off to college and it wasnt senior year, I would be trying hard to be your girlfriend." Did I screw up and she's sugar coating or is it sincere?
She told me that she wasn't looking for a relationship because she was going to college, so she didn't worry about it. She said, "If I didn't go to college and it was a senior, I'd try to be your girlfriend." Did I mess up and she's covered in sugar or is that sincere?

Split damage weapons RULE at SL20. Dark Hand is bae and so is being essentially unkillable. EDIT: I would like to mention that although the ring set I recommend is mostly end-game gear, I can assure you that it is not necessary to be functional at all! With just the 19 levels on VIG, you can still be essentially unkillable without relying on the rings because the low weight of the set-up allows you to wear heavier (and presumably more protective) armor. In fact, given that the 15% damage taken increase of the Prisoner's chain overcomes the cumulative life of the Life Ring and Ring of Favor, it is more optimal to use something else (not to mention the Ring of Favor increases at this low level, aside from health, are not really game-breaking); I just wear them because it allows me to use a wider range of armors for fashion souls. Hornet ring adds ~130 damage to my riposte (the same as a single R1) so you can safely remove it; I use it because that face-crush animation is sick. Apologies if my initial wording was misleading, and have a great day!
The black hand is bae and so is essentially uncontrollable. EDIT: I would like to mention that even though the set of rings that I recommend is mainly the end-of-part equipment, I can assure you that it is not necessary to be functional at all! With only the 19 levels on VIG, you can always be essentially uncontrollable without counting on the rings because the low weight of the setting allows you to wear a heavier (and probably more protective) armor. In fact, since the 15% increase in damage taken from the chain of the Prisoner exceeds the cumulative life of the Ring of Life and Ring of Favor, it is more optimal to use something else (not to mention the Ring of Favor increases at this level, aside from health, are not really revolutionary); I wear them simply because it allows me to use a wider range of armor for fashion souls.

guy rejects girl, guy gets annoyed with her friendship, girl backs off and guy tries really hard to talk to her even though she doesn't really have anything to offer. Why?

Boyfriend wants nothing more to do with his former best friend but I'm still friends with both.
Customer returned some items and got a $20 credit. She then demanded that we give her $20 off her next purchase, and got pissed when we refused.
Am I smart to wait for a warmup or is it go-time for firewood? EDIT: No, i'm not out of season firewood for this year. I'm just trying to get ready for next year. Seems like I am definitely jumping the gun, we're way behind depending on how you look at it.

I feel like I've got my old self back again. EDIT to add, because I just remembered! She remarked that it seems that I am rarely posting on Facebook these days.. ha… I told her that is because I am spending 8 hours a day on the job search instead. :-)

Here are my 2 questions: Should I use the assembly instruction set or is there some fancy C library? Will it screw up if I multi-thread my operations? Sorry for the self-post by the way...I've looked at the FAQ and stackoverflow before, and I still didn't find a well-written documentation about it. Thanks for you help! :)

serious reservations about the article, but there are some points worth considering. Deserves a follow up study from an institution capable of doing this work justice. Edit: Oh yeah, and they also didn't include a negative control for at least some of the experiments, which is just weird, especially when you include a positive control. Edit 2: They actually managed to mislabel the graphs in Fig. 1 as well. Skepticism growing. Edit 3: To respond to some of the comments. Yes I know there's other distribution patterns than a perfectly linear dose response curve. I was just surprised that in Fig. 1 they only reached significance on the highest and lowest parts of the curve, with the same effect size for a 6 order of magnitude difference. I am a student and am currently doing biology research, but not on cancer, so there are some subtleties that might have slipped by me. I also wrote this at the tail end of an all-nighter because I have a presentation to give to a number of PIs in my department today. No, I am not a Monsanto shill. Yoojine might have some good points on stuff I missed below.

I expect that a break-up between Mike and Rachel will only increase the drama, instead of end it.
My friend acts like he wants to date me and tells me he doesn't want to date anyone, including me. I'm confused.
My friend pretends he wants to go out with me and tells me he doesn't want to go out with anyone, not even me.

LoL has some issues but anyone that has spent any time playing other games should have played at least one game with many more bugs that have taken longer to fix and balance issues so deep that the only way to fix them is to permanently ban specific characters or strategies (and I'm not talking "we have to always ban Kass" perma ban, I'm talking "Riot disables Kass in every tournament or deletes him from the game")

Plus, do you really have a better game to play right now for last gen systems?
