although we didn't have our beer market killed by prohibition, the number of breweries did dwindle during the 20th century, and interest in beer equally so, but beer is most definitely on the up in the UK now.
Although we did not have our beer market killed by the ban, the number of breweries decreased during the 20th century, and the interest in beer the same, but beer is definitely on the rise in the UK now.
Although our beer market is not destroyed by the ban, the number of breweries has decreased in the 20th century, and the interest in beer is just as great, but beer is certainly on the rise in the UK now.
We borrowed a friends car, jumped a railroad track, messed his transmission up, backed home to the same spot we found the car and didn't tell friend about the adventure.

Seriously, read the whole thing. But if you really can't be bothered, I started getting paranoid because of my ex, she lied to me a lot and spread rumours that I hit her after the break-up

had a dream about death and rebirth, felt like i was being possessed by something, now im scared. :)   I would like to mention that this subreddit is seriously amazing. If it didn't exist, I would not have any place to discuss these things in a mature, meaningful, intelligent way. The responses i have been getting have been exactly what i have been looking for and more. You guys are a life saver and a force of good in this world. Seriously. If this didn't exist i would have to deal with so much b.s. trying to find people who could have these sorts of conversations/exchanges of ideas in my city. That would be a daunting task indeed. Thank you. yes you.

Got high as a kite, bike brakes unusable, completed errands, turned down more weed/alcohol, watched the hell out of Batman.

Wonderful bf of 1.75 years is fabulous except he has random spans of time (usually a few days) where he disappears off the face of the planet for no reason. It bothers me a lot, especially since he's so unpredictable with communication since he goes from being on skype at around the same time every day to totally disappearing with absolutely no notice or clues beforehand. I wish I could say I'm stronger but it's hard on me emotionally, because he's not a rock - I can't count on him to be there for me. How do I get him to stop taking me for granted?   Someone help?   NOTE: Advice to DTMFA will not be taken.   NOTE 2: During warm phases I'd say we talk about once every 12-24 hours, and during cold phases he could go up to a week if I didn't intervene (i.e. by calling his mobile phone and by some stroke of luck manage to catch him and saying things like "hey stranger" - but he hates when I call his phone so I stopped).   NOTE 3: We communicate the least out of all our friends in LDRs.

In terms of raw damage you have to have literally the entire enemy team of 5 standing within cleave range for Battle Fury to have any measurable advantage, and in return you get shittier stats. This is of course only speaking for Omnislash level 1, but ideally as a "rush" item, you want the item that will make it stronger early on so you can farm quicker. Now, this isn't accounting for a lot of factors obviously- whether or not you're autoattacking during the jumps makes a difference (since it was very early game that I considered, I just assumed that neither item would give you the speed necessary to attack during Omnislash) or for factors like the fact that if you hit an enemy with extremely low or possibly negative armor from debuffs, that the cleave damage could actually deal more than a direct attack against a heavily armored hero, since cleave damage is calculated based on the primary target's physical armor, but in the simplest terms, Aghanim's Scepter is a clear winner in the early game. In the late game, against big groups, I agree that Battle Fury makes the bigger difference, but when you're that farmed, Scepter remains relevant since it gives you more time for invulnerability and more time to dish out autoattacks, which is why I pick up Battle Fury really late.
In terms of gross damage, you must have literally all the enemy team of 5 standing in the clean range for Battle Fury to have a measurable advantage, and in return you get some crap statistics. This only speaks of course for Omnislash level 1, but ideally as a "rush" element, you want the element that will make it stronger early so that you can grow it faster. Now, it does not take into account many factors of course- if you are self-attacking during jumps makes a difference (since it was a game very early that I considered, I just thought neither one would give you the speed necessary to attack during Omnislash) or for factors like the fact that if you hit an enemy with an extremely weak armor or possibly negative debuffs, that the cleve damage could actually treat more than a direct attack against a heavily armored hero, since the cleve damage is calculated on the basis of the physical armor of the primary target, but in the simplest terms, Sim is a clear game winner, Sim is a clear game.
In terms of raw damage, you need to literally stand the entire enemy team of 5 in column area for Battle Fury to have measurable advantage, and in return you get crappy statistics. This is of course only for Omnislash level 1, but ideally as a "Rush" element, you want the element that it's stronger early on so that you can farm faster. Well, this is not for many factors of course- whether you're car attack during the jumps makes a difference (since it was very early game that I looked at, I only assumed that no element would give you the speed that is necessary to attack during Omnislash) or for factors such as the fact that if you hit an enemy with extremely low or possibly negative armor of debuffs, that the gap damage could actually be more than a direct attack on a heavily armored hero, since Cleave damage is calculated on the basis of the primary target physical armor, but in the simplest words, Aghanims Scepter is a clear winner in the early game. In the late game, battle against large groups, I puff gap the time, that I's more time, that I'm the rough gap, that I's more time.
In terms of gross damage you have to literally have the entire 5-stop enemy team within the range of neckline for Battle Fury to have some measurable advantage, and in return you have more bullshit statistics. This is, of course, just talking to Omnislash level 1, but ideally as a "rush" item, you want the element that will make it stronger early so that you can cultivate it faster. Now, this is not to notice many factors obviously- whether you are or are not self-attacking during jumps makes a difference (since it was a very early game that I considered, I just assumed that none of the elements would give you the speed needed to attack during Omnislash) or by factors such as the fact that if you hit an enemy with very low armor or possibly negative debophes, that the scot damage could actually come in more than a direct attack against a heavily armored hero, as the scot damage is calculated on the basis of the physical armor of the primary target, but in the simplest terms, Aghanim's Scept is a winner in the early game.
Russian (and Chinese) AAMs are very much behind the West.   Wait, I'm not done.   Russia has no real GaAs or GaN industry so you can imagine how good their AESA is going to be. Nor can they build good IR imagers (why do you think they buy Thales imagers for their tanks?).   Frankly many of the Russian/Eastern European guys who knew what they were doing (there were a lot) bought a plane ticket in the 90s, coincidentally the Russian/Eastern European education system went to shit right about then. Russia has about a 0% chance of catching up to the West.

When faced with a home robbery, yes, but on the whole you are 12 times more likely to kill a visitor or family member than an intruder, and your risk of successful suicide triples.

One business was better (and doing more good) than the other. One race is not better than any other, nor is one gender or belief system, and no one group is doing more or less good,  so I don't see how it applies. Feel free to get my head straight on how it does if I'm missing something, which I get the feeling I am.     If you want a cold, hard, moral-free answer, here's my crack at understanding issues not tied with general morality:   Communism would suggest the government should.   Free market systems suggest the government shouldn't.   Evolution suggests the government shouldn't.   Christianity gets kindof weird when money is involved (none of this was about money until you presented a business example, if they were people fighting Christianity would say it should but it's more complex than that).

One of the cases was better (and doing more good) than the other. One race is no better than the other, nor a single system of gender or belief, and no group does more or less well, so I don't see how it applies. Don't hesitate to tell me how I'm missing something, what I feel I am. If you want a cold, hard and moral answer, here's my difficulty in understanding issues that are not related to general morality: Communism suggests that the government should. Free market systems suggest that the government shouldn't. Evolution suggests that the government shouldn't. Christianity becomes a bit weird when the money is involved (none of these questions was about money until you presented a commercial example, if people fighting Christianity will say it but it's more complex). So I think I want to know what perspective you want. My perspective is not worth much. So I can't believe that I defend the concept that discrimination should be stopped.
A business was better (and more good) than the other. A race is not better than any other, nor is a sex or belief system, and no group does more or less good, so I don't see how it is. Feel free to get my head, as it should just be, when I miss something that I feel I am. If you want a cold, hard, moral-free answer, here's my crack in understanding questions not connected with the general morality: Communism would suggest the government. Free market systems don't beat the government. Evolution does not beat the government. Christianity becomes somehow strange when money is involved (no one of them was about money until you presented a business example, if they were people who fight Christianity, would say it, but it's more complex than that). So I think I want to know which perspective you want. MY perspective is little worth. Besides, I can't believe that I should defend the concept that discrimination should be stopped. Wow.

Regarding physical labor jobs, it's all about choices. There is no legislation that will equalize men and women in physical labor jobs as long as pregnancy is a mitigating factor in ability to do physical work. How is that unfair? If you do the work, you get the pay. The fact is that women often choose not to get into these jobs because they don't want to be in the environment. Is there discrimination in the workplace; of course it is...we all know it still exists, but this report is just being disingenuous in how it relates the info it is trying to get across....   Oh yeah, one more thing; I'll just leave [this]( here. Read it at your leisure.

Can someone explain the difference between getting pre-qualified, pre-approved, and whether we should look for a mortgage broker?
These Germans hadn't caught a break in centuries before arriving in the US. That's why they tend to lump when compared to the rest of the melting pot.   BTW, my mom was a German who grew up in Africa before moving back to Europe. After that, it gets complicated.

I just had some terrible experiences in WvW and want to understand what anyone could possibly enjoy about it.   Edit:  After reading the responses, it seems that I should take the time to learn some of the nuances of WvW. I was trying to derive a certain kind of gameplay in a mode that I didn't understand while using a build that wasn't suited for it. It sounds like I'm still not going to get Factions-style PvP and that's just a fact that I'll have to get used to. I'm done griping for now.   ... For now...

FU by smoking from my roommate's pipe which may have been used for other substances or perhaps I bought laced pot.   I ended up stopping to smoke regularly once I moved out of the college residence. From time to time I'd take a puff off a J but not much. The last time I got high was New Years 2012.

Had success at MTTSNG/MTT, feel cash is weakest part of game, back to work in 1 month from baby leave where I won't have time to play MTTs on weeknights so it's time to get better at cash since it's what I'll be mainly playing then, and what better way then to learn from the bottom.   EDIT  - I made a post a couple weeks ago regarding an updated "Guide to Beating the Micros" and I will be adding to that as I play through the limits and in some time will have that to add for the newer players to read as well.
I've had some success at MTTSNG/MTT, I feel that cash is the weakest part of the game, back to work in 1 month from the baby's leave where I won't have time to play MTT on weekdays, so it's time to get better in cash since that's what I'm going to play mainly at that time, and what better way to learn from the bottom.

So, here's the deal, When I put the game in [windowed mode]( It works nicely but cuts off some of the actual gameplay screen, so I would like to play in full screen mode, however, when I do play in [full screen mode]( that happens with it looking like a box, what you can't see is that there are black bars on the sides much like those youtube videos that nobody wants to watch, I can work with black bars at the top and bottom, but this just does not work... How can I fix this?Summary:So, here's the deal, When I put the game in

The law didn't change and it was upheld in 2014 in a court case.         Regardless of everything else, this all seems completely normal to me. You chose to lie on your taxes for 6 years that you weren't selling products (prints or digital images). And now the state is coming after wedding photographers.   Nancy Drew would be sipping some tea right about now with her feet kicked up on a table.

I agree but the issue that OKC would face is that they don't have a starting point guard to replace him with? They don't have a point guard capable of filling the starting point guard spot, and Westbrook isn't playing the position badly enough to justify putting in a player that is sub-par.

Libyans felt they would be successful in overthrowing Qaddafi's government due to recent events in neighboring countries, the influence of the West in creating legitimacy for their cause, and that Qaddafi would not respond with force.  Qaddafi had no choice but to try to repress the protests in order to hold on to power, which quickly deteriorated into a civil war.

I agree but the issue that OKC would face is that they don't have a starting point guard to replace him with?

Men do not understand women (in a lot of senses), women do not understand men (likewise), because of inherently different interests at the base level. Any insights gained are, as far as I'm concerned, a bonus and should be celebrated. (But that's just my opinion and I would never use the differences to justify abhorrent behaviour)

you need to either go pick it up or nicely ask to pay somebody at your college to forward it. all else, tell them to return the package to the original sender and MSFT will eventually send you a new Xbox. To ensure this, make sure your information is up to date. But, this way would take the longest amount of time, probably something like 6-10 weeks.

A doctor ordered general and STI lab tests. The insurance company refuses to cover them as preventive care (under the Affordable Care Act) by saying the CPT codes don't match, therefore they are routine and not necessary. I am stuck with a $700 bill.

15 students trapped in a high school. A student must murder to escape. The remaining students hold a trial to determine the killer. If they correctly identify, killer is executed. If not, everyone but the killer is executed, and life goes on.   The story is great, and the characters are great. I highly recommend it.

It bothers me that talented writers and boxing enthusiasts like /u/noirargent and /u/youhavethenerve are needlessly and endlessly being harassed, simply for being dedicated to making /r/boxing the best boxing forum on the internet. I'm afraid that if this whole "clone" business goes too far, we may lose another fantastic contributor to this community. Please, don't let this happen again. We all know how "Star Wars: Attack of the Clones" turned out. Fortunately, this doesn't have to be an episode II for our community, if /r/boxing uses the jab a bit more...   *One more thing - if you guys are going to continue degrade this subreddit with your troll tactics, you could at least make more creative usernames.

version of the other thread:   If you can spend hundreds (thousands) of hours into the multiplayer, you could be a little bit curious and spend 6 hours to play through the campaign, enjoy (or hate) the developers' work around the universe of the game, and grab some new camos, skins, double XP, and (potentially) guns in the process, unlocked forever for the multiplayer.

Don't be super aggressive early on, wait until you have a chance to kill something and make sure you don't feed.     Choose your starting items well, it can make the difference between you killing the enemy carry or simply sapping xp.     Get AC and a Heart/Octa Core as your core items, BKB and S+Y are also sometimes good.     Choose your situational items based on the situation, not your guide.     Use common sense when playing, winning is more important than your K/D/A.     AC is a better 1st big (5k) item than Heart.     I'm lazy so I didn't bother comparing Octarine, if anyone wants to do that, I'll give you reddit silver.     Stop flaming, people will like you more.

Stumbled upon the DLC   Edit: Sorry, wall of text not wally enough. Wanted to add that the DLC content is AWESOME. Artorias was probably my most fun boss fight. 20-some-odd tries, but had a blast with it.

Share ideas of pokemon that can be trained and used for casual battling without having to connect to the GTS/Friend Safari.   Edit: Listing the options below as I and others find them:     Wobuffet - Any defensive Nature, Shadow Tag. 252 SpD, 252 Def, 6 HP. Counter, Mirror Shield, Encore, and Destiny Bond. To get Encore on Wobuffet, breed a Wynaut and make sure that if you're breeding two Wobs together you use the Move Deleter to get rid of Safeguard on the parents so it opens a slot for Encore. Hold Leftovers or Shell Bell.     Calm Ludicolo with Ice Beam, Giga Drain, Scald, and Leech Seed. It's ability should be Rain Dish in case you encounter a rain team. Have it hold leftovers. Its only weakness is flying, poison and bug. Give it 252 Hp, 204 SpD and 56 Speed. -Thanks to HisPanic-Attack

Make sure that you don't rely on punishment to raise your children. If it was an accident, don't punish them, just tell them why it was bad and not to do it again. If they hurt someone else or their property, punish them and make sure they know why it was wrong. Above all, make sure that your children KNOW that they are appreciated and thank them or reward them when they do hard work or get good grades. I also believe it is a good idea to have them read about the hard times that those in the past have felt. Narratives that help you live the experience of losing a family member due to the Holocaust instills a sense of righteousness in children, as long as it isn't cynical.   P.S. Seeings how I am only 23, I may seem a bit unqualified to give advice (and I know I myself still have a lot to learn), but I've babysat both family members and the children of friends in the past. I'm the go-to guy for babysitting because I apparently have a way of making children wanting me to babysit for them again. I try to use the same formula for "parenting" as I posted here (no punishments however, can't do that!) and the children really respond to being told "Thank you little guy!" or "That some great work!"

If you look at trends in art, fashion and music, followed by photography, the opposite of your statement is true. Since the global economy took a dive, a sense of genuinity and non-flashy took over but it takes time before this becomes mainstream.

Relationship is mostly great, but girlfriend has totally unexpected outbursts about what a shitty person I am every 30-60 days.

I have no frame of reference so any input from similar relationship experience is appreciated.

I've been diagnosed with Post Traumatic Personality Disorder, which as I understand is somewhere between Post or Complex Traumatic Stress Disorder and Borderline Personality Disorder.  Some symptoms that I present seem to mimic BPD, some mimic PTSD, it's becoming cancer in my marriage, probably compounded by a year of psychedelic drug abuse.  I think have a pretty good plan for the way ahead.  Any advice anyone has would be really great.

Neither ending is truly missable or force you to restart the game.   Edit 2:  If you get any items in either final chapter, they follow you when you're put back to where you were.  None of these items are game breaking if you decide to do the false final fairly early.   Edit 3: Finishing the false ending just puts you right before the crystal you use to activate the ending, not the beginning of the chapter. Also, all items obtained in the final dungeon do not respawn in the final chapter.

Hipsters are generally hypocritical/paradoxical, won't admit to being hipsters, and generally don't see the irony of creating a culture of counter-culturalism.   Also, I forgot to mention it, but there is a large percentage of Mac owners who are hipsters. That may tie into at least Reddit's hate of hipsters, as I would argue a large majority of redditors are PC users who dislike or have a distaste for Mac. Working at Best Buy, I can predict with about a 93% accuracy when a person is looking to buy a Mac just because of how they look (and yes I'm pulling this percentage out of my ass now, but we do have a running tally at work of who has accurately predicted the Mac sales, and I have the highest count of correct predictions compared to incorrect predictions). And I recognize that's called profiling, but it's sales, it's something you have to learn how to do well if you want to sell well. Every company that involves sales knows how to do it to some degree. Also, this is just me wanting to add in a little something about my profiling skills, but I can predict with crazy accuracy when someone is coming in to buy a laptop for their kid in order to play Minecraft. Also, I freaked out a woman the other day when I also guessed her kid's age correctly (I always say twelve no matter who the person is, because that seems to be the median age of Minecraft players, and the kid happened to be twelve).
I don't see the irony of creating a culture of counter-culturalism. Also, I forgot to mention it, but there is a large percentage of Mac owners who are hipsters. This can be linked to at least Reddit is hate of hipsters, as I would say a vast majority of redditors are PC users who don't have or have a distast for Mac. Working at Best Buy, I can predict with about 93% of accuracy when a person is looking to buy a Mac just because of what they're looking at (and yes, I'm taking that percentage out of my ass now, but we have a large number of who accurately predicted Mac sales, and I have the greatest number of correct predictions in relation to incorrect predictions). And I recognize that it's called profiling, but it's sales, you have to learn how to make someone buy me well.

Working at Best Buy, I can predict with over 93% accuracy when a person is looking to buy a Mac, just because of how they look (and yes, I pull this percentage out of my ass now, but we have a running number at work that has accurately predicted the Mac sales, and I have the highest number of correct predictions compared to false predictions).

Steven vs. Amethyst. I'm thinking that Amethyst will be brainwashed into joining Yellow Diamond's or the other Diamonds' side. This is very likely because in On The Run Amethyst completely lost herself into fighting pearl because she was so outraged by the fact that she was a Kindergarten gem.

if melee assassins cant outdamage / outduel people or split push / dive when enemy makes a mistake, etc, then playing them will always be ineffective and pointless because ranged champions can deal the same damage as them from a safe distance, while usually having a better laning phase, ranged AA, more cc, better mana costs, better build paths, more options in playstyle, better sustain, better teamfighting, better wave clear, ability to siege, etc, etc. also, melee carry build paths suck.   sorry for the long post and please try not to base your entire opinion/response of melee assassins off of scenarios where a fed guy caught you OR off of zed, because he is in a class of his own! ^_^   PS: im d3 if that matters, not amazing but im definitely not clueless lol ;p   edit: grammar etc
If the killers of melee cannot compensate or defeat people or split the shoots/dive when the enemy makes a mistake, etc, then playing will always be ineffective and useless because the champions of range can do the same damage as they do at a safe distance, while they usually have a better phase of laning, varied AA, more cc, better mana costs, better build paths, more options in the style of play, better support, better fight the team, better get up, better seat, etc., etc. also, melee transport construction paths suck. sorry for the long post and please try not to base all your opinion/response of the killers of melee out of scenarios where a fed guy caught you OR out of zed, because he is in a class of his own! ^_^ PS: im d3 if it counts, not surprising but certainly not without lol;p edit: grammar etc.
If Melee's assors get off / overdo people or split push / diving, if enemy makes a mistake, etc., then playing them will always be ineffective and pointless because ranged champions can handle the same damage as they do from a safe distance, while usually using a better Laning phase, ranged AA, more cc, better mana cost, better build paths, more options in playstyle, better get better team fighting, better wave clear, siege ability, etc. etc. also, Melee wear build paths suck.

Anxious to move to new-less-old-and-busted design, opening /r/diamondclubtheme for testing even though not all style work is done, could move the theme over sooner if you guys want TO DO IT LIIIIIVE (almost anything is better than the current style).   [EDIT]  Okay, I went live, report problems here.   [EDIT #2]  Did some work on the sidebar, check it out. Also added flairs for Brian and Justin (so they're easy to notice)   [EDIT #3]  Added <>s around everyones name, because that seemed like the correct thing to do.

I have not found anything to be OP with the ghost heat bumped up to 4 from 3. Recommend keeping this change in place going forward. Possibly re-evaluate after Clan ERMLs get reviewed. Based on how many variants are helped by this, even if there's one or two that become a bit OP, address those via quirks but leave the GH change for the sake of the rest.

1) I owned the approach.  You gotta.  The interaction will flow so naturally after that 2) It is natural to qualify yourself in between showing attraction.  LoveSystems posits this as a linear stage from attraction--> qualification --> comfort --> seduction.  It's not necessarily linear, but you have to solidify one before you get to the next.  Comprende? 3) I was successfully able to move to comfort stage.  However, I could've amped the interaction a lot more.  I was afraid, and I wanted to look like a normal human being.  I didn't call her a DOG and stare her down, but alas, she only stayed at a 5 out of 10 on the emotional scale.  AMP MORE AMP MORE!!!   Thanks guys.  This was my first post.  Keep at it!

I think because no one has complained that warning signs are too muted we must all see similar colors.
Play Rift if you want a traditional MMO that's Free to play. Play WoW if you want the best experience and don't mind paying. Runes of magic is in free fall and has greedy publishers. Its a great game, and if you WANT to play a WoW clone, I suggest looking into the private servers of Runes of Magic.

We had to move our wedding date up by a year to July 30th and I managed to plan and book our entire wedding within a week. Some of our cousins are mad at us for not inviting them which we had to do because of our budget. On the plus side we just heard from the bank that we were approved for a mortgage amount much higher than we need! I'm much happier now that we are having a smaller wedding so to anyone considering something similar I say do it!!

Road Not Taken is difficult but fun. I would like to hear winning strategies for this game because I can't get past day 5!   EDIT:  A few other things that  may or may not be helpful to people....(please feel free to add your own tips):   I have noticed with bees I can grab them and throw them away real quick and they will chill. 'Coons and moles you can throw in the fire for good food. 3 hives thrown together to make a honey that's worth plus ten.   I don't know what to do with wolves. They will eat deer but I can't figure out how to get rid of them.   I also can't figure out what to do about hawks. Those pesky buggers!   When the black demon thing is in the room I just let it hit me. I don't know how to avoid it, other than running out the door.   ALSO  In my basement it says I can ban some objects. I have banned bees but they still appear. I wonder what is the point? The other things I can ban don't really pose any sort of threat or difficulty.

Game updated, now requires premium. I lost progress and premium bonuses make me feel like I cheated.   Edit: turns out I was talking out of my ass. I bought the premium account and all my progress was kept intact. Its just confusing wording from the devs. By "unlocked", they meant that they can be accessed. The player still has to progress through the missions. I'm not sure if its placebo,  but the game performs better,  and PvP is pretty fun. I just hope that players will buy the game so I will have more people to play with. :-)

I'm not sure if his placebo, but the game works better, and PvP is pretty fun. I just hope the players buy the game so that I can play with more people. :-)

Christians don't throw their lives away.   I meant 'you' in a more general sense (religious people in general), and there are evidently many many religious people who throw their lives away because they believe they'll go to heaven or something like that. And also people who throw others' lives away. Convince someone he's doing God's work and you can make him do terrible things with a smile on his face.   Good for you that your faith empowers you, but I'm tired of seeing good things attributed to gods because it diminishes the efforts of people, and all the bad things attributed to "free will" and human corruption.   >there's no control for this experiment and one could attribute my current worldly success to luck and probability   I'm not claiming it has to do with luck, I'm claiming it has to do with you putting effort in and achieving things for yourself. You are doing those things, not anyone else.

But yeah, that's it. I'm about to turn 22, feel no happiness in having successfully circled the sun another time, but instead feel sorrow and anxiety that I'll be alone forever, mostly due to who I am.

I won an award for being the best performer on stage at the Grand Ole Opry after being only a half time member of a show choir for most of the year.

EDIT: This might be a strange activity on the outside with minimal exposure but in high school I truly had a passion for this and loved every moment of show choir.

I won a prize for being the best performer on stage at the Grand Ole Opry after being just a half-time member of a show choir for most of the year. If you like something, but they are not automatically surprising on it, practice and put on hard work. One day amazing things can only happen. Probably the best life lesson I have learned too.

Wall of Flesh is an anti-aggro deck which likes killing the enemy board whilst keeping its' own alive, it struggles against other heavy control decks and Loatheb, but it's a fun and viable deck to play on ladder and is a treat for people looking for a change of pace in the current HS meta.   Feel free to ask any questions about it and I'll try to answer all of them. If it receives enough recognition I'll continue this trend with the other 8 classes (6/8 are finished currently)

Do not hesitate to ask all the questions about it and I will try to answer all. If it gets enough recognition, I will continue this trend with the other 8 classes (6/8 are currently finished)

Introduce special attacks that would require prayer switching into some lower-intermediate to lower-high level monsters, balance it so that you'd don't truly have to unless you want to. Make the difficultly/telegraph of the attacks progressively harder as you gain more slayer levels. This puts a learning curve into a necessary end-game mechanic.   Thank you for your time.

Make the difficult/telegraph attacks progressively more difficult as you gain more layer levels. This puts a learning curve in a necessary end-of-game mechanic. Thanks for your time.

there is no cross distro installer, which is why it's harder to install software in Linux.   Anyway, for Minecraft you just install openjdk-jre from the Debian repo, download the Mincraft jar and start it with: java -jar ~/Downloads/Minecraft.jar

I think that we should start clarifying if we're talking about feminists who make a difference by calling them movement feminists or if they don't by calling them ideological feminists so that when we talk about the former (usually radical), the latter (mostly moderate) doesn't mistakenly think we're talking about them.

A McDonalds cashier touched me. I ran away without telling her how inappropriate it was.
My boyfriend's boyfriend (who used to be my boyfriend too) has now given our boyfriend an ultimatum to choose between us. I'm 99% sure he'll choose him, but should I wait and see if we can work this out, or do I cut and run since their relationship is so unhealthy?   UPDATE:  Thanks for all the advice, Redditors. You all really help me find some perspective. FYI, in case you're interested, boyfriend dumped me on Thursday. Sucks, but I pretty much figured it was going to happen. I think from here I'm just going to be working on taking care of me first (I've been taking responsibility for WAAAAY too many people lately), and not concern myself with them. Personally, I think they're doomed, and have said as much to both of them, but they can't/won't listen, so que sera, sera. At this point, I'm not sure if I could let myself trust the boyfriend that just dumped me again, so even if they break up, I think this relationship is probably one for the history books. Oh well. Fortunately, poly is awesome, and I happen to be dating a new guy (I was dating him before all this blew up), who is the least jealous and possessive person I've ever met. He's really been a great support for me through this. So, sucks, but it's over, and I feel like I have some closure, and can move on at least.

The media is scared of the Robertsons and with good reason. They cannot control this family and they have not compromised their beliefs.

all I am is a Peter Gibbons - ever since my long-term girlfriend broke up with me, every single day of my life has been worse than the day before it. So that means that every single day that you see me, that's on the worst day of my life. This is despite implementing all the changes and suggestions people usually make when someone is in this situation.   Thanks for taking the time to read this, I really appreciate any help or advice :)   Help?

Comcast and TWC are deliberately and routinely restricting services, creating geographical monopolies, and lobbying against the consumers interest. They are blatantly violating two core sections of antitrust laws. These practices are deemed by the courts to be so obviously detrimental that they are categorized as being automatically unlawful. Could someone lawyer me a bit and explain why they are not being prosecuted, but instead, are merging?

Comcast and TWC are deliberately and routinely restricting services, creating geographical monopolies, and lobbying against consumers’ interests.

Lip balm is great to put on before you fall asleep.
safe choke play isn't an oxymoron.

I have problems saying no to food. What do you do to manage your impulsivity around food?
Do you think the straw hat crew will get more members?
Caught red handed running a stopsign,I knew I didn't need to provide anything about CHL in my situation with gun in car (not on me). But this is also the same if I was being detained for anything else. If I'm not carrying, I don't have to say a peep about having a CHL. BECAUSE if I AM carrying, I'm expected to bring it up immediately.
I knew I didn't need to provide anything on CHL in my situation with a gun in my car (not on me). But it's also the same if I'm being held for something else. If I'm not wearing, I don't need to say a word about having a CHL.
I knew that in my situation I didn't have to provide anything about CHL with a gun in the car (not on me), but that's the same thing when I was locked up for something else. If I don't wear, I don't have to say a look at a CHL. BECAUSE when I wear, I will address it immediately.
Are the burbs or inner city Portland better for a young left-leaning atheist family of 4 with young children?   Thanks for all the great responses.  We are hoping to pack it up in the RV and head out to visit sometime this week.  Any recommendations on the best route of finding a place to rent and discovering neighborhoods with good schools??

Are the Burbs or downtown Portland better for a young left-wing atheist family of 4 with small children? Thank you for all the great answers. We hope to pack it up in the camper and visit it sometime this week. Any recommendations on the best way to find a place to rent and discover neighborhoods with good schools??
Told my dad I hated him and immediately regretted it.
