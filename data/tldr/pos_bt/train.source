Summarize: I'll chime in before this gets buried. Although I'm only 22 myself (bearing in mind the drinking age is 18 here), it's certainly true that even since I've been drinking there has been massive growth in interest in craft beer and 'real ale' as it'll often be called here (although arguably different things... For the sake of argument).   You're right in saying we didn't have the prohibition to destroy our brewing heritage, but any older drinker from here will tell you that 20/30 years ago British ale earned it's reputation for room temperature, brown, flat ales, after big breweries took over the trade and moved to homogenise the market, along with the continental lager influx that was as far as I understand, very similar to how the big 3 took over the beer market in the US with bland pilsner style beers.   Now there's a huge resurgence. I go to a beer festival in my home town each year which now has over 1000 beers, and pubs are reopening off the back of the increased interest and diversity that an ever increasing number of new breweries are offering the public.   I'm on mobile now but here's one article  regarding the increase.Summary:
To sum up: I myself am only 22 years old (taking into account that the drinking age is 18 years old here), it is true that even since I have been drinking there has been a massive growth in the interest in craft beer and'real ale' as it will often be called here (though possibly different things... for the sake of arguments). You are right to say that we did not have the prohibition to destroy our brewery heritage, but any older drinker here will tell you that 20/30 years ago British beer gained its reputation by ambient temperature, brown, flat ales, after the big breweries seized the trade and moved to homogenize the market, along with the continental influx of beer that was as large as I understand it, very similar to how the big 3 took the beer market in the US with bland pilsner-style beers. Now there is a huge resurgence. I go to a beer festival in my hometown every year that now has more than 1000 beers, and the pubs are sheltering from the growing diversity that are increasingly being offered in the new beer.
Summarize: I'm going to chill before it's buried. Although I'm only 22 years old (taking into account the age of 18 here), it's certainly true that even since I drank there has been a massive growth in the interest for craft beer and "real beer" as we will often call it here (although we can say different things... For the sake of the argument). You're right to say that we didn't have a ban on destroying our brewing heritage, but any older drinker here will tell you that 20/30 years ago British ale gained his reputation for room temperature, brown, flat beers, after big breweries took control of the trade and moved to homogenize the market, with the influx of continental beers that was within my reach, very similar to how the 3 big took the beer market in the United States with beers of style pilsner bland. Now there's a huge resurgence in my hometown that has now increased the number of beers.
Summarize: A friend left my house with another friend.  He left his car in my driveway.  A couple of other buddies were at my house and suggested we take his car and go jump it over the railroad track.  There was a dirt road that had a railroad track at the top of a hill.  There was a rapid drop off on the other side, so you could get considerable air.  "Ok," I say and we head out.  We jump it a few times before the car's transmission goes out.  The car would only go in reverse.  We back the car back home in reverse.  We were miles from my house and we even had to back it down main street.  We put it in the exact spot we found it.  The friend comes back, says his good-byes and gets in his car to go home.  Shortly, he comes in the house furious.  "The jerk sold me a lemon!  I've only had the car a week and now it's leaking transmission fluid!" It was extremely hard for us to keep a straight face.  Before anyone calls us jerks, the car wasn't worth much and we got it all fixed up.  I told him about it 10 or so years later. Man, that was a fun day.Summary:
Summarize: Agreed.  As I mentioned in a reply to a now buried comment.   This is terrible journalism and economic method.  Author uses a poll asking what people believed the inflation rate was  over the last year .  Counters this and says everyone is wrong by finding  the annualized inflation rate over 30 years .Summary:
Summarize: This has been bothering me for about 6 months now, and I still don't know how to feel about it. Basically I left my ex around 4 months ago after over 2 years of being happily in a relationship. The reason for that was trust. I couldn't trust her. She made me so paranoid and then blamed it all on me, that it was all in my head. She denied it all and made me feel like I was insane and that it all was inside my head. I still feel unsure about everything, I'm having a hard time trusting people etc. Anyways, I'll get on with what pretty much happened over the time, hope someone has time to read what I have to say.   Basically, all the problems started before we actually were "officially" in a relationship. She had this guy, a very good friend of hers. It was more like a FWB type of thing though, and she had apparently had feelings for him at some point at least, but he never wanted anything serious. Between the beginning of our dating and our official relationship thingie they still had something going on. They did have sex once, and casual making out and such. GF told me after about a year, which was quite odd to me. I thought that I should probably be careful with this guy.   Took a few months again, AFAIK they didn't hang out or anything anymore, nothing. Everything was just great. My GF did have a habit of being very flirty with other guys (we'll get back to this later). Then his old FWB was in contact again. I didn't like it at all, but she just told me they're really good friends. And one evening she was drinking with him and some other friends of hers. Well, apparently this guy had been talking a lot of shit about me, trying to make me look  really  bad. Also tried making out with my GF, and from what I heard from her she didn't answer the gesture. What also made me feel quite bad was that her friend was encouraging her to cheat on me for a few months. Yet my GF kept on hanging out with that friend of hers who wanted my GF to cheat on me.   Later on, a few other guys came along. My GF was extremely flirty with them, especially when I wasn't around. All of this I heard from her friends (some of them who are very good friends of mine as well). She denied it all. Thoughts were running through my head, I was wondering if I'm just really too paranoid. I constantly heard about my GF flirting and being intimate with several guys. Anything within the limits of touching genitals or kissing. She kept going on, denying it all. She even did that at her own party when I was just behind one door throwing up in a bucket. She was taking care of me for five minutes. Her friends took care of me for several hours and told me that she's doing it again.   This went on with her ex-FWB and some other guys for some time. Then I just had it. She kept hanging out with that ex-FWB of hers really often. He constantly came up with ways to see my GF (they were neighbours, so that gave him the advantage). I  knew  he wanted sex from her and I mentioned that to my GF. She denied it as well, telling me he just wants to be friends. After a while, I decided that I've had it. I talked to her on the phone, she was hanging out just with him at her place. Of course knowing what he had been trying for many, many months and all the history they've had I just didn't tolerate it. The next day I went to her place, told her that that it's over unless she stops seeing him. She didn't choose me.   After the break-up I did a lot of talking with me and my ex-gf's mutual friend, who has been one of my best friend for years now. It was devastating to find out how within minutes of me leaving her place after breaking up with her she went and had sex with that ex-FWB of hers. She also had told her friends she had known what he wanted all along. We were good friends with my ex after the break-up. Still, she lied to my face more than ever. To me, she said we still have a chance to work it out. To her friends, she told the opposite. Then followed the most dick move she could do. She started spreading a rumour to people (we have LOTS of mutual friends) that I had been violent towards her and hit her. I still have no idea how many people believe her, but I've made it clear with lots of people. Then again, she told most of our mutual friends, her family etc.   I just can't believe how she could do all that. All that time I thought she would be the love of my life, the perfect girl for me. I loved her with all my heart, shared all of my secrets with her (even one I've never told my parents or anyone else) and did everything to be loyal to her. I still feel that I'm not enough. Not for her, not for anyone. My self-esteem has always been terrible. This has made it so much worse. I've been drinking like fuck every weekend after the break-up and it feels like it's the only thing keeping me going. I have no motivation in anything and I constantly feel paranoid of the fact that people think of me as someone who beats women up. Who'd believe me, anyways?   A month after the break-up she also met this guy and a week after meeting him they're together. At first when seeing her at parties and such she went and made out with him right in front of me on purpose and she's still doing that at times. I just don't get the point. Everyone thinks that's awfully done by her as well, seeing how we had quite a long relationship and she just jumps into a new one right away ditching everything I had with her. Didn't feel good either, no..   We sometimes talked about how if we'd break up it'd go on without a fight and we'd stay best friends. I believed in it. What I believed in even more was that I would spend the rest of my life with her. She told me the same things. The best experiences I had ever had were with her. Then she just smashed it all to bits. I feel crushed, reddit. Helpless with all of this. I'm just hoping someone would bother reading my wall of text, maybe relate, maybe have advice for me. If not, at least I have all of this typed out.Summary:
Summarize: Don't worry. I have the feeling this is a way for my brain to test what will be my reaction if I did something extreme. My brain is constantly telling me:     jump from the window   kiss a stranger   kill a cute animal     But not in a assertive way, more like a "what if?" It's like if you are near a cliff. People experience the feeling to jump. This should be enough to put you in a safer position ("I am feeling I could jump, that would be unpleasant, better to back off")   I would be  way  more scared if I couldn't have these thoughts, that would make me unprepared and unable to control such thoughts when the situations are stressful.Summary:
Summarize: I posted on r/occult last week, but i don't know of any other subreddit that could do this interpretation thing justice. i will try to describe this recent dream i had as well as i can. I just woke up about 10 minutes ago, so its still kinda fresh.   So there was a lot of stuff going on at the same time in my dream. first, i was in a starbucks coffee place ordering a coffee and i kept having a weird conversation with the barista. don't remember the details, but i do remember that i would unconsciously stare at him in a menacing way while he was working, and he would stare right back. i would blink back to consciousness within the dream and apologize or shake it off. (I used to work at a Starbucks). Then, i started seeing messages within certain objects and stuff, for example i saw some 'occult' message within a worn-down warning label on a debit card machine. i then went to the middle of the coffee shop, and sat next to a table, and i had the overwhelming feeling that people thought i was stoned or something, and thats why i was acting so weird.   There was this girl there too, getting a coffee with her boyfriend or something. She notices me and i start talking to her about stuff. i get my coffee and we go out the door. meanwhile i am talking about how its weird that nothing really exists on its own, in its own right, like how the sidewalk is just a thought in our mind and is built on the feelings we have  of walking on it, etc. She heads down the street with her boyfriend, leaving me behind to think about this stuff on my own.   then, basically everything dissolves and im looking at my neuronic pathways and brain matter and ideas. i am massaging these ideas in order to relax them, relax my mind, and expand my mind to a deeper place. it feels like a muscle, sort of. maybe a muscle of information.   The next few things are a bit blurry, but i will try to recount them as best i can. few things first. these are some things that i was thinking about and that shaped my dream. my grandfather died last week, and i just saw the dark knight rises yesterday. I have been reading the invisibles by grant morrison and also prometheus rising.   Ok. so i remember someone was standing on a cliff looking down and there was an immense drop down an unbelievably dark cavern below. dark, grey colours. someone was filming him standing on a thin ledge getting as close as possible to the edge. then a lot of things happen. i get a very very strong pull towards feeling this connection/undercurrent of my life and it is trying to tell me something. this intuition pulls connections together and i realize that the theme is death. i hear it as all these feelings and themes and pictures of the invisibles comic and dark knight movie and prometheus rising thinking this book is genius all together (felt like i was recounting specific instances in my recent life that were meaningfully connected to this idea) while i piece together the sentence; death. and rebirth. rise from the ashes. I realize i have to die and be reborn, so i let go. I have now let my 'ego' die. i am now barely conscious and i can feel/hear myself talking in my sleep. it honestly felt like there was some sort of demon or evil-ness in my body. my voice is calling out for my brother for help, and it seriously sounds like a demon. its not my voice. theres two different pitches to it, high and low pitch, super scary. i then wake up from this state, and feel good. i still feel like im dreaming, and i am hyper aware of by bedroom and my body.   ok. that's the gist of it, i think. there was a lot more to the dream than i have written, i just wrote the stuff i remembered. and im not a good writer anyways. sorry. but if anyone could help me understand what the fuck just happened, please do! ill try to remember more details if i recall them. thanks!Summary:

Summarize: Except he pretty much said himself that he just picked a randomish sounding number, and I can think of no reason why he wouldn't have done that.  Especially given the point he seemed to be making.   EDIT:   > The answer to this is very simple. It was a joke. It had to be a number, an ordinary, smallish number, and I chose that one. Binary representations, base thirteen, Tibetan monks are all complete nonsense. I sat at my desk, stared into the garden and thought '42 will do'. I typed it out. End of story.   >--Douglas Adams   Unlike (apparently) most of his fans, I believe him.   EDIT 2:   I'm still getting a lot of replies so I'll try and explain  why  I believe him. The complete lack of a meaning and the randomness of it was really  the whole point , if you read the context in the story. It wasn't supposed to be a profound metaphorical statement about the meaning of life, it was supposed to very deliberately be the complete opposite of that; a  staggeringly disappointing lack of profundity  as the punchline to a shaggy-dog joke. A race of people had spent thousands of years building an all-powerful computer, and waiting for it to finally answer their question...the final result was supposed to fall completely flat and be  absurd and meaningless . That was what was funny about it. As a writer if I were trying to come up with a number for that context, I would carefully make it as random and unimportant a number as I could possibly think of. If it had some meaning to me, I would reject it as an appropriate number to use to make that joke work. And really the fact that so many readers do seem to take it so seriously anyway almost makes the joke seem even funnier in hindsight, and shows you how well written it was.Summary:

Summarize: One time I came home and couldn't find my cat, I didn't think much of this; as you all know, cats frequently do their own thing and come out when they want to be seen. I went into the kitchen to grab a quick snack. As I reached into the fridge I froze, what was that sound? Meh, it's probably just the house creaking. But wait, it happened again; it was coming from inside the walls...   I am not the superstitious type, but this was starting to freak me out. I decided to investigate, leaving the kitchen and turning down the adjacent hallway. As I closed in on the source of the scurrying sounds a voice broke the silence, "mrrrrrRRRROOOOWWWWwwwwww, mreeoow". What the hell, where was my cat!? I looked around, there was no sign of him. He meowed again. Still no cat in sight. I looked down towards the large ventilation next to my bedroom, inside two cute, albeit scared, eyes stared up at me from the darkness. I briefly stood there in shock, then went into the garage to get a screwdriver so I could remove the vent and let him out. Took me a little while to figure out how he got in there, but eventually I figured it out. There is a unfinished room in the basement of the house, inside it is a small 2 person sauna, beside it a bunch of boxes of things in storage. The cat climbed up the boxes, on top of the sauna, along the top of the open door, into the roof of the room, and finally into the ventilation system which had no cover on it there. I have no idea how long the little guy was trapped in there but he has yet to attempt it again.Summary:

Summarize: Single-handedly: British Airways' frequent flyer awards policy. I figured out I had enough reward points on my credit card (never spent any for 10 years!) to upgrade an insanely long flight I need to take in 6 weeks, as long as I transfer all of them onto my frequent flyer account (which is not reversible). I was all excited to not ruin my back, legs, health and mental well-being having to fly cramped into the small economy seats for 15 hours (and twice within 4 days, at that).   What they do not tell you when you sign up for the frequent flyer stuff: the availability of seats for frequent flyer rewards is ridiculously low. This includes upgrades to bought seats. And with ridiculously low, I mean that it's impossible to get any seats on well-traveled routes but easy to get seats on totally weird destinations and combinations of flights, even if you plan ahead for a year. And then, after 24 months, all your accumulated miles vanish, since you don't want to use them on shitty flights and they become void if not used.   Also, they make you pay horrendous taxes and fees on any rewards-seats, up to the point where it is literally hardly any money-saving at all to book an economy seat with your frequent flyer miles.Summary:
I thought I had enough reward points on my credit card (never spent 10 years!) to upgrade an incredibly long flight that I have to take in 6 weeks, as long as I transfer them all to my frequent flyer account (which is not reversible). I was excited not to ruin my back, legs, health and mental well-being have to fly narrowly in small economy seats for 15 hours (and twice within 4 days, at that time). What they do not tell you when you register for frequent flyers: the availability of seats for frequent flyers rewards is ridiculously low. This includes improvements for purchased seats. And with ridiculously low, I mean it's impossible to get seats on well-traveled routes but easy to get seats on totally weird destinations and flight combinations, even if you plan for a year.
In summary: One-handed: The frequent flyer awards from British Airways. I found out that I had enough reward points on my credit card (never spent for 10 years!) to improve an insanely long flight that I have to take in 6 weeks as long as I transfer all to my frequent flyer account (which is not reversible). I was all excited to not ruin my back, my legs, my health and my mental well-being that has to fly in the small economy seats for 15 hours (and twice within 4 days on that). What they don't tell you when you sign up for the frequent flyer thing: the availability of seats for frequent flyer rewards is ridiculously low. This includes upgrades to buy seats. And with ridiculously low, I mean, it's impossible to get any places on well-travelled routes, but simply to get seats on completely strange destinations and combinations of flights. This includes upgrades to buy seats. And with ridiculously low, I mean, it's impossible to get any places on well-traveled routes, but simply to get seats on completely strange destinations and combinations of flights, even if you plan a year ago. And then, after 24 months, they don't want to pay to be empty, if they don't want to pay for your flight, if they disappear.
Summarize: Unaided: British Airways’ frequent flyer award policy. I realized that I had enough reward points on my credit card (I never spent anything for 10 years!) to improve an incredibly long flight that I need to take in 6 weeks, as long as I transfer them to my frequent flyer account (which is not reversible). I was all excited not to ruin my back, legs, health and mental well-being having to fly tight in the small economic seats for 15 hours (and twice within 4 days, on that). What they don’t tell you when you register for frequent flyer things: the availability of seats for frequent flyer rewards is ridiculously low. This includes improvements to buy seats. And with ridiculously low, I mean it’s impossible to get seats on well-traveled but easy routes to get seats in totally strange destinations and flight combinations, even if you plan for a year. And then, after 24 months, all your accumulated kilometers disappear, as you don’t want to use them on crap flights and become empty.
Summarize: Edit: GOLD!? I love you people! Thank yooou and happy holidays! :D   I'm afraid your algorithm has an off-by-one, or possibly off-by-two, error.     On most microwaves the user must also press "start" after hitting 2, 0, 0   On many, but not all, microwaves the user must press "time cook", or a button with a similar function, before pressing 2, 0, 0, "start"     Therefore, while your logic is almost correct, it would actually be beneficial to mash the start button if the time was under 2:30 or 3:00 depending upon the make of the microwave.   However, once we factor in the hand-movement complexity it becomes a different story. If we wish to enter the time using numbers, we now must deal with between 3-5 buttons (assuming cook time < 10:00) to press per microwave usage instead of just 2-3. This makes it less likely that a single hand placement can satisfy all button presses.   Lastly we must consider the cognitive processing required for the numerical input method. If we wish to use a single hand placement for hitting 3-5 buttons (if this is possible at all) it will surely take much more cognitive power to figure out the correct positioning and confirm that this is a valid solution to our button-pressing problem. To avoid this issue we may wish to press the buttons using only one or two fingers. This is certainly a worthwhile choice, but it does mean we will have to move our hands more to compensate in the decrease in cognitive power dedicated to solving this problem. Note that both scenarios require more cognitive processing than simply mashing the start button does, since mashing the start button only requires users to look at the number and mindlessly hit the start button until it matches the desired number. In other words, using the button mashing method we do not have to process information beyond pattern matching. We do not have to calculate hand position, process the semantic meaning of the symbols on the display, or process the semantic meaning of the symbols used to denote our desired time.   Due to these complications, there is no clear 'best solution' to this microwave button pressing problem. One must consider the cognitive power available to the user (a monkey can likely mash the start button with better accuracy than using the numerical method, a distracted person might not want to think about it, etc). In addition, the desired times may require anywhere between 3-5 button presses using the numerical method and this, along with the cognitive power of the user, affects the hand movement complexity. Considering all of these things together is the key to obtaining the optimal solution to this problem given a certain cognitive capacity available to the user and a certain desired cooking time.   Of course, calculating the optimal solution requires cognitive processing power in and of itself. For this reason, users may wish to employ a heuristic with a "good enough" probability that they will find the optimal solution to the problem based on the criteria above. Interestingly, this probabilistic method, if implemented correctly, may be the best solution to this problem in practice by reducing the overall time and cost of the algorithm.   In other words, it's probably best to estimate a number such that, if the desired cook time is greater than the number, the numerical method is used. Otherwise, the start button mash solution should be used.Summary:
To do this, it is possible to do the option "compatible", we must make the function "compatible". We cannot use the method "compatible" to make the function "compatible". In most microwaves, the user must also "start" after having 2, 0, 0, 0, many, but not all, microwaves must press "time dependent", or a button with a similar function, before pressing 2, 0, 0, "start" Therefore, while your logic is almost correct, it would actually be beneficial to mix the start button if the time was below 2:30 or 3:00 depending on the brand of microwave usage. This makes it less likely that a single hand placement can be another story. Finally, we need to enter the time with numbers, we now have to use between 3-5 buttons (assumed cooking time < 10:00) to press the use per microwave number.
Summarize: I'm from Charlottetown. I left on a bike trip on June 23 and went down Nova Scotia, over to New Brunswick, down into Maine and across the states to Ottawa, where I am now.   Before I left on my trip we had constant shitty weather.  On the day that I left and all through the maritimes (through the states, too) the weather has been gorgeous and hot, I've only been rained on twice.Summary:
Summarize: Just some insight to what it's been like:   We knew each other for the first year, we became good friends. For a week she became distant and didn't talk much. She started working where I work, so we'd see one another alot. One day she came in, and she had a mad look on her face. Didn't look at me when I spoke to her and I asked if she was ok. She said she was fine, just not feeling that good.    I tried changing the subject to something we spoke about a week ago, and she barely answered. She started working on something I was working on(putting together an item to sell). I helped, and I knocked over something by mistake, and she's like "Dude, come on..". I stopped and just looked at her. She didn't look up, just stayed quiet and ignored me. I just quietly said bye and walked away. I did not speak to her until she started speaking to me again. We became cool again. She tried to get me into her Bible studies class. I'm not really all that religious but she insisted I go. So I spent a summer going with her every Thursday. She was inspired by it, and even though we didn't share the same beliefs, I admired how passionate she was in what she believed. We became better friends after that. At one point it was ruined because a few idiots made a rumor about us. She was mad at me, didn't speak to me. Then we spoke again and she just wanted some space, and I agreed. She did not want to talk about it though. Before we agreed to give one another space, she just hated the idea of talking it out. She pointed it out to another friend that if there's something she's mad about, she does not like to talk about it. She'd rather read her bible and pray. She came back around and for over a year we've been great. She was more of my wing-woman. I did like her but the fact that I'm not as religious as her makes me feel like it cant work out. She was also always there to give me advice when I had problems with someone I was seeing as well.   But she's been a big inspiration to me. She use to call me out on being pessimistic. Said I need to be less negative and focus on positive things. And the fact that I could be more social. So she made me wanna be a better person. I started losing weight and being more outgoing. This was at a time when she was with someone. But she would message me sometimes to see how I was doing. Eventually she broke up and we would go out and eat sometimes and I'd help her with homework and sometimes take her home. I'd always make time to help her if needed. Either to cover her, or even let her borrow my car when her's was broken down. She'd bring me food sometimes, or a coffee. I'd do the same for her. At one point I was away and she asked if I was at work. Told her no, and found out she brought me food. Felt bad, but also felt happy that she thought to do that. For her Birthday I got her a blank leather book to write in, and a card telling her she's the most inspiring person I've ever met and I'm thankful to know someone as amazing as her. She loved it and gave me a big hug. Felt like our friendship was stronger than ever.   The situation:   As of recent, last week, everything was good. We talked about helping her finish a t-shirt design for a fundraiser and I made time to help her out. She didn't call me on Tuesday. So in the morning when I saw her, she was happy to see me. So I asked what happened the day before. She told me she went running. I said "oh ok, that's cool, hey next time let me know and I'll run with you". She said "no it's ok". I asked "Why not?" She replied "Because.. I kind-of don't wanna run with you" I said "oh ok" It made things awkward. And recently she flaked out on a few things we planned. And I asked her why she kept flaking out last minute. Said to her "why is it when we plan something, you back out thr last minute like "nah Im good."" She interrupted me by replying "You want me to start saying no from now on?". I realized it upset her. Wasn't suppose to be that serious. She walked away, I walked up to her, and she said she did not want to talk about it anymore, because she would get annoyed. I took a deep breath and decided to change the subject. She was reading notes and made jokes with me from some things she was reading. So for the rest of the day, things were good again.. Somewhat. I felt bad for what I said to her, so I felt some shame as to how awkward I made things. Also a customer went off on me because he felt the price of his purchase was too high so he started insulting me. I felt upset. I told her and she reassured me to just let it go. She made a joke to bring the mood up. Later she left. I spent the whole weekend in Vegas. Still feeling bad over the situation. I wanted to see her so i can apologize for it. Saw her on Friday. She looked mad. I asked if she was ok. She told me because of what I did, the friendship cant be the same. I was puzzled and asked what happened. She did not answer. I told her that whatever I did, if it's over what I said, i'm sorry for that. She didn't seem to listen.  She did agree to talk later. Next day she was working directly with me. Not a word was said. She was just quiet and in a bad mood. What hurt me most was she'd joke with others but it felt like she held a big grudge. I asked if we cant talk, she said "NO".   I was like "Why are acti.."   "Don't bother me!". She interrupted.   "Look I just wann cle.."   "Your bothering me!"..   I just stopped and walked away. My heart dropped and I was so confused. So yeah. I'm on my way out from that workplace. What hurts the most is, this is how she will remember me. And I just want her to know that whatever I did, if it's about that morning. I feel terrible.   =========================Summary:
She gave me a little pleasure, she gave me a little pleasure. She gave me a little pleasure, she gave me a little pleasure. She started working where I was working, so we saw each other a lot. One day she came, and she had a crazy look at her face. She didn't look at me when I talked to her and asked if she was okay. She said she was fine, but she wasn't feeling so well. I tried to change the subject of something we talked about a week ago, and she barely answered. She started working on something I was working on (by putting together an object for sale).
She didn't understand that she was 'we were not far away and didn't speak much. She started to work where I was working so that we alot each other. One day she came in, and she had a crazy look at her face. She didn't start me when I spoke to her and I asked if she was okay. She said she was good, just didn't feel good. I tried to change the subject, what we talked about over a week, and she barely answered. She started to work on something I was working on, just remained calm and ignored me. I just said goodbye and went away. I didn't talk to her until she started talking to me again..
She started working where I worked, so we met often. One day she came, and she had a crazy look on her face. She didn’t look at me when I talked to her and asked her if she was okay. She said she was fine, but I wasn’t feeling so well. I tried to change the subject to something we talked about a week ago, and she barely answered. She started working on something I was working on (I just kept a subject to sell). I also helped her, and I also realized something by mistake, and she told me that she didn’t want to talk about anything else. I stopped and just looked at her. She didn’t look at me, she just kept quiet and ignored me. I just said goodbye and I left. I didn’t realize what she told me.

Summarize: I'd have to say that is exactly what they were offering. If you remember the first years of TOR and it's community they restated things that we're MMO like, w/o auto-combat, with an emphasis on story. It's a fantastic game, is it special? No. And GW2, untill now, was never sparking anyone's radar for 'special'.   The issue everyone sees with the MMO genre is this: It's boring. TOR has probably the most exciting first character experience I've ever had. It does not, however, deliver on the PVP side. PvE side has a lot of promise. But we do not see any of the amazing fights they could do. Seige of Kaon and Puzzle Bosses should be BioWare's future in PvE. Not Big Boss Man fights.   GW2 has the fantastic idea of bringing it's original concepts for GW1 to a full-fledge MMO stage utilizing tactics from DAoC (on the PvP side) and WAR/Rift (on the PvE side). However, GW2 is going to have to succeed in the one place the failed dramatically in before, PvE. I think they've got a good chance and the ArenaNET team is a fantastic set of developers.   Onto the actual topic: While ArenaNET is fantastic, they were also this fantastic pre-GW. After GW launch they became very lackluster in how they were dealing with the game's meta. They were very clear on PvP and their direction on the changes of abilities. I can see GW2 changing the way they were back then. I can also see them giving people a run for their money.Summary:

Summarize: I usually fix my car myself but when my car died on the highway I had trouble figuring out it was the distributor that needed replacing. from the highway I had it towed to a garage because I had no time to fix a car and went to get the car the next day. The guy replaced the distributor a $150 part. He charged me $800. I explained that I know how to fix cars and I know the prices of parts because I have replaced a distributor before. Not even 10 minutes of politely saying "fuck you" and he charges me $200. That is still a $100 profit for that garage but I was happy with that price, paid and left.   I've rebuilt engines, replaced suspensions, gutted interiors and fixed rusted floorpans, replaced multiple brake systems, built a turbo system for my current car and I'm currently doing a headgasket on that car so I do know my shit for the most part. I just could not believe the first time in years I don't fix my car myself I get that shit pulled on me. never again will I go to a garage for anything I can do myself.Summary:
Summarize: I define fiddly as having so much bookkeeping that you have to give it nearly as much thought as playing the game itself. Constantly checking counters or sliding up/down on different tracks, checking multiple cards for effects each turn, etc.   By my definition, something like Agricola isn't fiddly at all. You simply refill the board each round, and it tells you exactly what to put where. Takes no thought. Castles of Burgundy is the same. You have to set out new tiles several times, but it's easy.   Sentinels of the Multiverse is certainly fiddly by this definition. Everyone is constantly checking various counters and anti counters and the villain cards and environment cards. Fiddle Fiddle Fiddle. Eldritch Horror is pretty fiddly, but really only one person needs to manage most of it. Miniatures games tend to be fiddly, but that's what people like about them.   I try to stay away from fiddliness in games because I teach a lot of them to a lot of differently skilled players. Games where you have to keep track of a whole bunch of stuff outside of gameplay tend to throw people off if they're new to games.Summary:

Summarize: I recently started watching Lost, I was very carefull not to read anything as I loaded this subreddit up.   I know nothing about Lost, apart from the fact they are stranded on an island, I just have one question.   Some of my friends said it wasn't worth watching it but I watched a few episodes regardless. I didn't know weather or not to fully commit to watching it or not, until... I watched the episode called numbers.   I loved this episode for some reason and before I fully commit to watching it I just want to know if the numbers are a re-occurring theme throughout the whole of Lost? Do they just last a season or two?Summary:
Summarize: background: i am 17 andmy parents dont know i smoke so i have to keep my smoking a secret, but they are fully aware of my brothers smoking habits though) I was coming home from smoking at my girlfriends, i was at a 6. when i came home my mom was downstairs waiting for me which seemed kind of odd. i said hi and tried to act normal. after a brief coversation she went into the kitchen and asked me to follow. when we went in the kitchen my favorite pipe "spyro" was sitting on the counter and i knew i was fucked.  i tried to act like i couldnt tell while my mind raced for an explanation. i quickly said my brother had left it in his room and i was holding it for him (he lives about an hour away at my dads house) which she didnt believe. i didnt back down though and stuck to my story. i went upstairs to confront my stepdad and tell him my story. he then said he didnt believe me and pulled out a bowl that i must have left in my hiding spot and forgot about. so then i start to think that im fucked again. i told them that it was my brothers as well and i was planning on throwing it away but i was too sketched to transport it through the house. (to this day my stepdad still doesnt believe me). my brother worked the nightshift so there was a good chance that he was working at that time but my mom decided to call him. i then for the third time thought i was fucked. thankfully he didnt pick up so i sent him a text telling him to go with whatever they say. but me stepdad picked up on me texting and put two and two together so i tried deleting the message before he looked at my phone. so now for the 4th time i thought i was fucked. but the gods shined upon me and the messages finished erasing right as he took my phone. in the morning my brother called my mom back and took credit for the pipe and said he didnt remember leaving the weed there but it was probably his. i owed him big time and later smoked him out for helping me and now my parents trust in me has been slowly restored.Summary:
I told her that I had taken the time to smoke at my girlfriends, I was at 6 when I came home my mother was waiting for me, which seemed strange to me. I said hello and tried to act normally. After a brief blanket, she went into the kitchen and asked me to follow. When we went to the kitchen my favorite pipe "spyro" was sitting on the counter and I knew I was fucked. I tried to act as I couldn't say while my mind was running for an explanation. I quickly said that my brother had left it in his room and I held it for him (he lives one hour from my father's house) that she didn't believe.
Summarize: So Friday my buddy had about 2 grams of some decently dank stuff so he left it to me to make firecrackers with some of it and he'd roll the rest. I used graham crackers, cookie butter (tastes just like cookies holy moly) and a little olive oil. Fast forward about 7pm, the firecrackers are made, the joint is rolled, we are on our bikes riding down the nature trail behind his house. We stop at a spot, fish a little bit and decide to start the sesh. We eat our firecrackers, and light up. We keep riding down the trail and while walking our bikes up this huge ass hill it's starting to hit my buddy, I don't feel it yet. So we decide to turn around and head back home, but his chain comes off his bike, he's like whatever. We get on our bikes, forgetting the huge ass hill and next thing you know we are bombing this bitch. I hear him ahead of me saying to the people that had just started walking the trail, "Watch out, I have no brakes... OH FUCK, I'm going too fast!" He speeds past these people and I follow and eventually we make our way back home. While walking, we encounter this big ass dog in the street barking at us with no collar. I stare it down. I felt a connection with the dog. The dog had a connection with me. I told it to stop and go home and it left! Wow. So now we go to our neighbor's house (about 9pm) and hang out. She's having a party Sunday (today) and she needed help setting up. We get there and I am starting to feel it.. my friend is already baked and I know I'm about to get hit hard, too. We move some stuff and sit on the couch and our neighbor comes over with some company and they start cracking jokes. I hear them, but it doesn't feel real. That joke wasn't funny, why am I laughing? Bro, you feel this shit? After what felt like forever laughing at these adults they leave, but one guy lags behind and comes over to us.  We are putting pillow cases on couch pillows at the moment.   "What's up?"  "Nothing." "Yall drink?" "Nah, not really." "Yall smoke?" My friend and I make eye contact and know we have to say no. "No." "Bullshit. come on now. I got the bong" "We don't have any weed." "I do, let's go fire up." My friend looks uncomfortable so I speak up fast and tell him no, but thanks for the offer. He tells us to think about it and we say ok. "Dude, we have to leave, he is the devil!" "He has weed!!" "No, we are already high as shit!" "So?" I convince him that we can't and he understands. Meanwhile, we figure out that we are too high to put the pillows in the cases and we just sit back down. After about 10 minutes we try again and this time all 4 pillows have their cases. (about 11pm)   We decide to go somewhere else in the house and we relocate to the living room where Batman is on, the one with Bane. So we sit down and we are stoned out of our minds and my friend lays down, but I am watching Batman. I'm so into Batman and as stuff happens in the movie I narrate what happens as I type it into my phone. Next thing you know, our neighbor says she needs more help. My friend looks at me and closes his eye back. Shit.. I have to help her.. I make myself back to her and see what she needs. I don't even remember what it was, but I did it.. I sit back down and she needs more help. I go help. She then takes me to her room and is saying something and I'm trying to follow and she gets a 50 out of her purse.   "I can't take this." "Why not?" "We barely did anything." "You guys helped a lot and I appreciate it so here." "You sure?" Then she punches me in the chest and says "Take the fucking money." The hit is pulsating through my whole body. I thank her and cooperate and head back to finish watching Batman. It's over. I grab the foam board (I needed for a project) I managed to cut precise as shit sometime earlier while high, and we head home. (12:41am why do I remember that?)   We walk across the street and reality still feels like a dream. I'm at a solid 8 (I suppose the higher you get, you start to adjust your scale, right?) and we are hungry. We cut up some chicken, I'm giving my friend directions while still high, we add some taco seasoning sauce stuff and I'm trying to lay down on everything in sight.. The counter, the table, the sink.. I'm done.. The tacos are finished and I add a bunch of seasonings. I raid their pantry and my friend is just looking at my like I'm crazy. I eat. I drink water, we head to his room. He has a decent sized bed so I sit on one end and lay down and he's on the other end. I eventually fall asleep listening to some Samurai Champloo..   Next morning I wake up. "Yo, did this shit and that shit and xyz happen?" "Yeah." I check my pocket for the 50. Holy Balls, it was real! I'm at about a 3 and things are warped, but I had control.. I cruised down to sobriety about 1pm.   Jeez. Next time I get that high I'm freeing up the whole weekend lol.  But I'm glad I still had decent control while I was that high. I could process things, I kept paranoia away, but I had to pay attention. I'm especially glad I could turn down a bad guy trying to push more drugs and alcohol on us.Summary:

Summarize: Hi reddit,   My LDR (300 miles) bf (m/21) and I (m/21) have an almost perfect relationship (1 yr, 9 mos) in so many ways. Our personalities mesh extremely well, we share the same values, our families like each other, we're committed to each other for life (I am to him and he tells me he is to me). The other week I surprised him for 9 days and it went beautifully well. He took me in with open arms and it was clear that he has always been loyal and faithful to me. He showed me off to his friends and spoiled me rotten with both affection and good food. We have a lot of chemistry and the sex is normally very good (with some bad days because I was jetlagged coming straight from Asia when I saw him). I could only speak for myself when I say that I'm very attracted to him and it seems that it's mutual.   The problem is that he sucks at communication. I mean, he's not AWFUL at it, but on a scale from 1-10 I'd give him a five. He goes through periods where he is excellent, and then drops off the face of the earth for a few days at a time, out of absolutely nowhere, and he's completely unreachable. Like, it's honestly impossible to tell when he's going to disappear, he just does, and it usually doesn't correlate with mood or anything, it's just completely random. I really don't get his psychology. Like, he appears to care about me but then vanishes.   I learned about the mancave argument, but men who are entering caves often show some kind of hint, like, "I'm feeling really shitty, i need to get things sorted out." But his vanishing is not always to go into a cave, especially since when he's having a hard time he usually vents to me about it instead of going into a cave (he more often than not takes the traditionally female route with problems). When he emerges, I like to pretend nothing happened as he usually does, even though I feel like interrogating him in order to understand why he'd disappear like that. Note that I notice a positive correlation between him disappearing from facebook and disappearing from me. (When he goes NC with me he never does anything on fb). But since he talks to me so much more than his LD friends and family, you can't even compare, but his parents say he doesn't talk to them either during these moods, except during their prescribed Sunday night chats, during which he usually keeps the chats quick and still ignores me if he's in a "cold phase" (though sometimes that's when he breaks the silence since he's on skype anyway.) He always gets mad at me when I question his loyalty or ask him where he's been, because it upsets him that I "don't trust him" (It's not that, I really do trust him, I just want to understand why he disappears because it toys with my emotions). He tells me I overthink things.   It's never been because of something I did wrong. Normally when I do something wrong he's very good at lambasting me about it (I like that about our relationship - he tells me what he feels so that resentment doesn't get a chance to build).   My friends say (and my intuition too) that he disappears because he's simply not a thoughtful person about people who aren't around in person. He doesn't think about talking to me, he just thinks "oh, I can hang out and watch TV in the common room with my friends, [insert name of show] is on!" He doesn't think about me when I'm not around, doesn't consider me in his small decisions (but usually weighs my opinion heavily in his big/important decisions) he doesn't care about how I'm doing on a day-to-day basis - he assumes I'm a strong woman and can hold my own, doesn't want to indulge in missing me in fear of ruining his grades... I've heard a whole range of explanations. I just want answers and asking him just gets him so frustrated with me, telling me that I overthink things and am being ridiculous.   It's not a "busy with work" thing. He has loads more free time than me. My bf is super quick and efficient with getting work done. While I was with him he got a 15-page report and powerpoint presentation done in around 10 hours total (over the course of 3 days) and he's done with class so he has all day free, and has zero extra-curriculars or jobs, so work is not a valid excuse. I know he has projects due but it's doubtful he'd ditch me for them, esp since he almost always procrastinates by talking to me while he's working.   I left his place on Tuesday morning and the last time I heard from him was Tuesday night when I told him I got in okay and he seemed distracted. Normally after we visit each other he usually sends me a sweet romantic text, email, or fb message about how much fun we had and thanking me for coming or having him at my place, but this time there was nada, just one text asking me if I had enough money to get from the train station to the airport. It's surprising because I organized a nice surprise, brought him lots of gifts from where I was in Asia, we had a great time, and I was able to lift him out of a slump. Based on our visit though, I wouldn't say the spark is gone at all. It's alive and well.   Our relationship is otherwise perfect. He just sucks at communicating. I spoke to some of his female friends (all are very genuine, honest people, and either gay or in committed relationships, don't worry) and they all totally sympathize with me and don't understand his behaviour either. They said if they were me they'd do the same thing (try to chase him) or worse (hit him upside the head, one girl joked), one of them even suggested I post it on reddit, so here I am.Summary:

Summarize is as if he has reconciled himself because he is not really so good that we share the same values, our families as each other, we are committed to each other for life (I am to him and he tells me he is to me). The other week I surprised him for 9 days and it went very well. He took me with open arms and it was clear that he was always loyal and faithful to me. I could only speak for myself when I said that I was very attracted to him and it seems that it is both. The problem is that he sucks in communication. I mean, he's not like AWFUL with him, but on a scale of 1-10 to say that he has nothing to do.

Summarize: You're right, in the early game, if the entire team is clustered together then Battle Fury is better, but it makes it weaker in a 1 on 1 (which is when it truly shines and when you need it for early ganks) and it makes you dependent on enemy positioning.   Say the enemy team is standing together close enough that each individual Omnislash hit will cleave them. With a level 1 Omnislash you deal 175-250 damage per slash and have 3 slashes. We can expect the average of each slash damage to be roughly in the middle of that range, which is around 213 damage. So the total primary target damage dealt by Omnislash, on average, would be roughly 640 damage. The chance of being hit by a slash given Omnislash's random search is 1 in 5, assuming no creeps/illusions/Meepos or whatever. The chance of receiving 35% cleave damage is 4 in 5, since it would affect you if you weren't the primary target. This means the expected average damage per hero of Omnislash comes out to:   (640 x (1/5)) <- how much they'll take from direct hits, on average   +   (640 x 0.35 x (4/5)) <- how much they'll take from cleave, on average   =   128 + 180 = 310 damage per person   With Omnislash at 6 jumps by Scepter, this is now   (1280 x (1/5)) = 256 damage per person   So in the early game you get a pretty negligible increase in damage, on average just over 50 extra physical damage per person- this is like a creep melee attack. And this is assuming the entire team of 5 stands within cleave range. But this is very situational and Scepter gives you much better stats overall, which is why I prefer it. Also, in the early stages, it's rare to see constant five-man grouping, and a Scepter ultimate is much more effective against a single opponent or even two opponents than a Battle Fury ultimate.   Say you run into two people standing within Cleave range. If you have Scepter the average expected damage is   (1280 x 1/2) = 640 per person   That's a ton. That's like two Finger of Death casts. With Battle Fury it becomes   (640 x 1/2) + (640 x 1/2 x .35) = 320 + 112 = 432 per person   This is an over 200 damage difference between the two in favor of Scepter, even with multiple opponents. It still stands true with three opponents:   (1280 x 1/3) = 430 per person   versus   (640 x 1/3) + (640 x 2/3 x .35) = 210 + 150 = 360 per person   Only with 4 people does it break even for Battle Fury, and just barely:   (1280 x 1/4) = 320 per person   (640 x 1/4) + (640 x 3/4 x .35) = 160 + 168 = 328 per personSummary:
Summarize: you are right, in early play, if the whole team is better grouped then Battle Fury is better, but it makes it weaker in a 1 out of 1 (which is when it really shines and when you need it for early ganks) and it makes you dependent on the enemy's position. Say that the enemy team is pretty close that each Omnislash individual touched the cleavages. With a 1 Omnislash level you do 175-250 damage per slash and have 3 slashes. You can expect the average of each slash damaged about in the middle of this beach, which is about 213 damage. So, the total primary target damage inflicted by Omnislash, on average, would be about 640 damage.
And if the whole team is clenched, then Battle Fury is better, but it makes it weaker in a 1 to 1 (that's when it really shines and if you need it for early ganks) and it makes you dependent on enemy positioning. Say, the enemy team is close enough that every single omnislash will hit them split. With a level 1 omnislash you will have 175-250 damage per slash and 3 slashes. We can expect the average of each slash damage to be hit in about the middle of this area, which does not creeps/illusions/meepos or whatever. The chance of 35% damage by Omnislash, on average, would be 4 in 5, as there is the chance of being hit by a slash given omnislash random search, is 1 in 5, provided that no creeps/illusions/meepos or whatever.
If the entire team is grouped together, then Battle Fury is better, but it makes it weaker by a 1 over 1 (which is when it really shines and when you need it for the first ganches) and makes you depend on the enemy positioning. Let's say that the enemy team is standing close enough for each of the Omnislash impacts to divide them. With a level 1 Omnislash occur approximately 175 to 250 damage per slash and 3 slash occurs. We can expect the average of each slash damage to be approximately in the middle of that range, which is approximately 213 damage per each. So the total primary damage treated by Omnislash, on average, would be about 640 damage per each of the slash effects. The probability of receiving slash damage is more than 5 per each of the slashlash effects is 1 on average, assuming that there are no more than 5 per slashlashlashlash effects.
Summarize: To add to your post.   R-77s are not only rare but outdated as well. Russia has very weak electronics development and production capabilities. Rumor has it they were using bought/stolen/counterfeit US Texas Instruments ICs, obviously much less capable than whats available to DoD. Mass fraction (therefor delta_v) is unimpressive, just look at the photos of operational missiles and you can see the motor isn't that big. Grid fins are high drag in the regime missiles operate and anyone who says otherwise (and some Wikipedia experts do!) has never seen any data from them.   Rumor has it that the R-27 had something like a 4% P_k in the Ethiopian Eritrean war, the pilots on the Ethiopian side were experienced Russians so the pilot quality excuse doesn't work here.   R-73 was impressive for 1982, but it is 2015 now. Even back in 1983 it's IR seeker was nothing special except for it's ability to do 40 degrees off bore. The R-74 doesn't have enough upgrades to make it anywhere near competitive with Western SRAAMs.   If we look at the Chinese end of things their most advanced missiles the PL-12 is R-77 electronics (shit) in an indigenous missile. So pretty much an R-77 with better kinematics.Summary:

Sure, both were difficult, but locking on made the KotS phase much harder and I ALWAYS lock on. On top of this, the Nameless King telegraphed his moves heavily and seemed to act much more predictably than the KotS. Nameless King was responsible for 3 deaths while KotS caused 6.

Summarize: I could stand behind such a petition if in the interest of equality, it also included that rapists would not be able to sue their victim for child support, should they have custody, and specifically included female rapists. Here's an example of what I'm talking about, from the shining beacon of legal excellence that is [Florida /s](   There is one other complication: As of right now, we define both child support and custody as the legal right of the child alone, ignoring any conflicts with the other rights by simply trumping all rights of the parents,  even if they are rape victims.  This effectively means that as of right now, a rapists crime  can  be argued to be irrelevant with enough time and a "good^1" enough lawyer. In order to challenge this, we would need to challenge the definition of child support/custody as superseding the rights of parents, which would as a by product unravel legal arguments in support of imprisonment of those unable to pay child support, and against Legal Paternal Surrender, and possible result in a wave of challenges to existing child custody and support cases. In short, it would require either a patiently ans carefully constructed legal reform that overhauls the status quo, or it would be chaos in the courtroom.Summary:
Summarize: Presence of a firearm in the home reportedly results in death or injury to household members or visitors over 12 times more often than to an intruder.   I've heard this statistic mentioned many times throughout various gun debates, but I've never once seen the article or source it was written in directly linked. I did a little sleuthing on that statistic, and was pretty disappointed by the lack of decent citation and figure releases. I was also disappointed by the poor scopes and tones of the studies. I'll elaborate:   The original article was very difficult to find and is not commonly cited by articles mentioning its figures. Here it is:   First off, the article is a biased editorial, not something written with the intent of displaying proper facts or data. The article contains no charts or tables and doesn't specify the scope or method behind any of the statistics it refers to.   To comment on some of the statistics mentioned:   > Suicide is the leading cause of death among gun owners in the initial years of acquisition.   Well, no shit. People buy guns with the  intent  of committing suicide. Better public health care and federally-accessible health records would pretty much eliminate this problem.   > Out of 395 fatalities occurring at a family home where a gun was present, suicide accounted for 333 cases (84%); 41 were domestic violence homicides, and 12 were accidents, while only nine were shootings of an intruder.   This study comes from one private survey conducted in the 80s in the greater Seattle, WA area ([link to study mention, again without showing extended figures or collection method]( It is not representative of the USA as a whole, and as such the numbers presented don't come anywhere close to any national surveys or estimates. It's also worth noting that Washington's suicide rate is higher than the national average, though not by much ([source](   And now, our favorite figure to mention:   > Presence of a firearm in the home reportedly results in death or injury to household members or visitors over 12 times more often than to an intruder.   [This]( is the only source used to bring up that figure. It's another editorial article written by a medical chairman who has spent years writing polarizing articles on gun crime and drawing tons of criticism for his poor methods of data presentation.

It's all about the tax code and working around it. Why would you pay more taxes than you have to? This is how people become billionaires.   The stock market will net you, on average, 3-4% interest unless you get really lucky. You pay 15-20% in taxes, what if the market netted you 15-20%? Everyone would jump in! That's the tax code.

Summarize: So me and my ex of 3 years parted ways a year ago, which was for the best for the both of us. We were incompatible in terms of where we were in our lives, maturity, sexually and maybe even personality wise. Both felt like shit at the end of the relationship and the decision to split up was mutual. I broke off any contact after we split up and though I glanced at her tumblr a couple of times during the first 6 months, we didn't speak.   We had a conversation over facebook 6 months ago when we had seen each other in the city and now when I got back from the city my college is in, I found her on Tinder. I had thought about her somewhat frequently during the last 6 months and had this urge to talk to her so I super liked her and we started talking on facebook again.   However, I come from a history of insecurity and I feel that I'm not gravitating towards her personality in order to get back together out of love, I just want her to like me. I get this sharp pain of anxiety in my stomach when it takes her a day to reply which I know has nothing to do with me wanting her badly - sometimes I even feel empty when I get her response. She had physical issues that lowered her sex drive to a 0 which caused a lot of the problems causing us to split up, and I felt rejected sexually by her. I realize that I yearn for her because I've put my own sense of self worth in her hands (perhaps due to the time when I was rejected sexually by her), but I don't know how to let go of the feeling of wanting to interact with her. Sometimes I'm struck by how I'm not all that interested in her personality, and I'm seeing this girl (semi-exclusive) who I am ten times more compatible with personality wise. The girl I'm seeing now [25F] has gotten to know me on a deeper level in 5 months than my ex did in 3 years.   She is also the most attractive girl I've ever been with and perhaps even seen in some aspects, so this surely has something to do with why I feel like I do too.Summary:

The bases were loaded with a full count in the top of the 9th, and the Yankees are up by one.  I was there with my father, and two of our good friends and neighbors, Junior and Steve, who we shared season tickets with.  Mo had, abnormally, struggled a bit in the inning, but the game was on the line, and every fan in the whole stadium seemed to be on their feet.  I remember the moment leading up to the 3-2 pitch, and the near complete silence as Mo, in trademark cool as a cucumber style, delivered a perfect low and inside cutter which resulted in a truly MASSIVE whiff of a strike.   It was soon after this moment, after the flurry of high fives and fist bumps between our group and the fans around us as well as a solid jumping hug with my dad that I stopped for a moment and experienced what I believe to be one of the greatest moments in my short life.   I felt the entire stadium shake.   The concrete of the upper deck oscillated beneath our feet with the combined jumping and celebration of the packed house of around 55,000.  It was right then and there, when I closed my eyes and let the energy of the situation sink in that I realized how happy my life was.  I have a loving family and great dad who has worked his tail off for his entire life to be able to share moments like this together with me.  I have friends who I know will always be there for me and my family no matter what.  I have the comfort of living in a safe environment in one of the greatest countries in the world.

Summarize: It was a summer in the year 2005, small beach town on the coasdt of Southern California. I, at the time, was 19, hanging out with a couple buddies when we heard of a Volcom factory party in Costa Mesa. So we head over there.   I had 3 beers before we got to the door, so I was feeling pretty buzzed (i'm a lightweight). I show the doorman my ID and he gives me a 21+ wristband. And all of my underage friends as well. So we go in and they have a full OPEN bar and in random buckets, redstripe beer and wine. So I grab some more beer and start drinking. Before I know it, I was hitting on random young ladies with my new found self confidence. One girl came up and we started talking but I thought she was into me so I grabbed her and kissed her, but as soon as I realized she wasn't kissing me back I let go and all my friends laughed and she stormed away.   I wandered around asking more girls if they want to make out but none obliged, so I found myself upstairs with a bottle of cheap wine and I drank about half of it. I then meandered downstairs and by this time I was so drunk I could barely walk. I saw my friend and I said, "watch this" and kicked the wall and a huge picture fell off it. We were then escorted out, and by this time we were all drunk and it was around 2am. So stupidly my friend drove drunk. I blacked out for about 30 mins until I got woken up by my friend yelling at me to "GET THE FUCK UP AND OUT OF THE CAR!!!!!!!!!!!!" So naturally, I did. We were at a church. He told me to go kick the church van. So we both, drunk, started kicking this random church van. I remember I kicked it so hard I fell down. Then I ran over and kicked a sign.

Remember 1 month ago when you posted on AskReddit [questioning why your posts never appeared in /r/gaming]( Someone gives you the [helpful advice to get a new username and start over]( Then TADAAAA, [Skeona]( is born. In fact, you’ve sent 30 links to reddit in a couple of months to that point, and since then almost nothing.

Summarize: Well said, thank you. I would never tell anyone to 'get over it' when they're the target of 'humor' based on hurtful stereotypes and I would appreciate it if the same courtesy were extended to me within my own community   It took me a long time to come to this same understanding, and for a long time I was one of the same sort of people who would shout, "Oh come on, get over it" etc.  I realize now that that's a profoundly unfair request to make of someone, and often a hypocritical one, as we've all got our sore-spots and touchy issues. It doesn't reflect well on us when we forget that fact and get hostile with others for expressing their feelings because sooner or  later we're likely to be in the same spot, and greatly resenting anyone who gets hostile and tells us that our feelings don't matter.   We should recognize that it's not a transsexual becoming upset by a joke at the expense of transsexuals, but the fact that there is a strong culture of alienation marginalization and stigma attached to transsexual people in our culture that is the underlying problem here.  If we work on that, then we'll end up having an awful lot fewer sentiments of offence to get upset over when transsexuals don't laugh at certain jokes that many of us may otherwise find to be both hilarious and in good humor.  It takes a bit of distance from tragedy before it can be safely laughed at, after all, and that sort of distance from being treated like they belong in a freak-show is a luxury which transsexuals in our society presently do not enjoy.Summary:

We must recognize that it's not a transsexual who currently gets upset by some kind of joke that, otherwise, it bothers us all who, otherwise, become hostile and tells us that our feelings are not important.
Summarize: In theory yes, this could be a very good thing. The key though is how seismically active the area in question is. For example, California is very seismically active. If stored strain on the San Andreas could be systematically released, then yes, the larger seismic events could potentially be avoided. There are scientists who spend their time generating risk maps in an attempt to quantify the risk associated with certain portions of an active fault. Oklahoma is very faulted up. Historically, the area was extremely tectonically active during and around the Appalachian Mountain building events which occurred ~300 million years ago. Earthquakes in OK are by no means a new thing - they have occurred over the years even in times during which fracing and injecting were not as prevalent. These disposal wells are likely reactivating pre-existing faults, NOT creating brand new surfaces. I guess this could be a good thing if enough strain were to build up on human timescales and be released in the form of a larger magnitude event.Summary:

Summarize: In theory yes, this could be a very good thing. However, the key is how seismically active the area in question is. For example, California is very seismically active. If the tension stored in the San Andreas could be systematically released, then yes, the largest seismic events could be avoided. There are scientists who spend their time generating risk maps in an attempt to quantify the risk associated with certain portions of an active failure. Oklahoma is very damaged. Historically, the area was extremely tectonically active during and around the construction events of the Apalachian Mountain that occurred ~300 million years ago. Earthquakes in OK are by no means a new thing - they have occurred over the years even at times when the fraction and injection were not so prevalent. These elimination wells are likely to reactivate preexisting faults, NOT create completely new surfaces. I guess this could be a good thing if enough tension accumulates on human time scales and are released in the form of an event of larger magnitude.

Summarize: Remember Riolu and Zorua. Rockruff is also a canine. If Rockruff has more than one Evolution, then expect all of them to be shoved down our throats like Lucario and Zoroark were. Rockruff is clearly getting special treatment,  with the special manga, the "secret" and all. I don't hate either Lucario or Zoroark, they are awesome imo but Lucario gets waaayy too much promotion (they tried and failed with Zoroark though)Summary:

Summarize: This is actually a pretty fantastic comparison. More than I initially gave it credit for. My initial reaction was that comparing the two situations would be comparing going out of business to death; that isn't accurate. Really the focus here is on this faceless, 'competitive' small business and some faceless (soon to be ex) business owner. My problem was that our question here, 'should the government intervene?' isn't usually viewed from a moral perspective. If you're looking for a moral perspective the answer (by my moral compass- i'm not used to one that labels hate as acceptable) is that the company, in being better, is serving the greater good of the people (by selling a better product, or selling in a better way, or at a better price) and that by the government interfering it is slowing down progress. That's the end result of a company (the failing one) hindering progress by refusing (or being unable to-that's the sad reality of the situation) to compete. Now, to say that black people, or white people, or christians, or muslims, or men, or women are simply being 'less competitive' would be pretty awful and generally unacceptable, because a business is the end result of choices made, and no one chooses race, gender or religion.   If you have to compare discrimination to being a better business than the other guy, realise first that when businesses compete, one loses because it is worse than the other. Women are no better than men, black no better than white, and christian no better than atheist.Summary:

Summarize: This is actually a pretty fantastic comparison. More than I first gave it recognition for. My first reaction was that comparing the two situations would be comparing going out of business with death; that's not exactly.

That is the final result of a company (the one that fails) that does not prevent the progress of a person (by selling a better product, or selling it is better man on earth) is that a business that is not better than that of the people on the street or people on the street.
Summarize: A little background story: We were very close friends before we got together. I didn't really like him in that way, but I decided to give us a chance. After a few months, we consummated our relationship. We had a lot of passion during the first few months, and we fell out of the honeymoon phase really quickly. We never really "dated" but just hung around and went out with friends.   It's been 4 years and we really care about each other, we really love each other, and we really want to get married in the future. But to be honest, I am really bored.   We're both 20 years old and I feel as if we're at that age where we're not old enough to have "adult" fun, but we're too old to have "teenage" fun. And we feel as if we're too young to go on "sophisticated" dinner dates. We both don't make a lot of money, (as a matter of fact, he lost his job almost a year ago severely limiting his ability to act as a boyfriend, which put a lot of stress on me because I felt like I had to be both the boyfriend and girlfriend, if that makes sense), so we can't do anything expensive. And since we're tight with money, I'm very frugal with my gas which makes it harder to go out.   We hang out almost every day, and all we really do is eat, sleep, and watch TV. It's hard for us to try to find things we like to do together. He's always asking if I want to try some of his hobbies, like TF2 and League, but I'm just not interested; and I have no hobbies that I could ask him to join into. Most importantly, my sex drive has been really low lately so we don't have sex very often.   Because of all this, I feel as if we're no longer a couple. It feels to me that we're just friends that have invested a lot of time into each other and have occasional sex.   Is there anything that we can do to spice up our relationship again? Any guides to frugal dating? Is there any way I can try to get my sex drive back to where it was in the beginning? (I'm on birth control pills which can be the cause considering it has a possible side effect of "low sex drive"). Or are there any suggestions to keeping us entertained at home?   Here's another thing, which may be an entirely different problem, or it may be related. He was my first and he's been my only. So other than I love him, the fact that we've had sex makes it hard for me to leave him. Sometimes I feel very lucky to have found someone so early in life. But at the same time, is it too soon to settle? A part of me wants to experience actual dating; but the part of me that holds onto the fact he's been my only partner makes it really hard to even consider it. And being bored is making it even more difficult.   So I guess my final question is: Reddit, should I salvage our relationship and how? Or should I realize it's time to move on?Summary:
I had a lot of passion for the first few months, and we fell out of the honeymoon phase very quickly. We never really "dated" but we just stayed and went out with friends. 4 years ago and we really care about each other, we really love each other, and we really don't want to get married in the future. But to be honest, I really miss each other. We're both 20 years old and I feel like we're at this age where we don't have enough money, but we're too old to have "ten" of fun.
I didn't really like him this way, but I decided to give us a chance. After a few months, we've finished our relationship. It's 4 years ago and we really care about each other, we really love each other, and we really want to get married in the future. But to be honest, I'm really bored. We're both 20 years old and I feel like we're at this age if we're not old enough to have fun "adults" but we're too old to have almost a year to have a lot of fun. And we feel like we're too young to go on "sophisticated" dinner dates. We don't see a lot of money if we're not old enough to drive "adults", but we're too old to have fun "teenage".
Actually, I didn't like it that way, but I decided to give us a chance. After a few months, we consumed our relationship. We had a lot of passion during the first few months, and we stayed out of the honeymoon phase very quickly. I can never "turn around", but I can only spend about 20 years and go out with friends. It's been four years and we're really not old enough to have "adult" fun, but we're too old to have "adolescent" fun. But, to be honest, I'm really bored. We're both too young to have sex and I feel like we're taking "sophisticated" dinner dates, we really want to have a lot of sex, and we don't have much to do to have anything.
Summarize: Not 100% sure what the etiquette is here. I'm having people over for birthday drinks on the weekend, one of them will be one of my good mates who I have known since high school. We have a sexual history, though I have no romantic feelings for him - when we had sex it was nothing more than sex. Thing is he's kind of a touchy feely guy, he likes to give big hugs. That's just his thing, always has been.   So, I don't know if I should mention our history to my SO. Would it just cause awkwardness or what?Summary:

Summarize: so yesterday i had made plans to go see my girlfriend who lives 2 hours away and that i had been dating for 8months. our relationship has been going really well up until now.   Friday arvo i asked her if she still wanted me to come to see her at her home 2 hours away in which she replied "yeah if you want to but if you cant im not bothered x" followed by " actually No, i dont want you to watch me play cos il play bad" so i said ok dont worry about it i wont come then.   this made me feel as that she didnt want me to come when i havent seen her in a week and a half. later that night she messaged me saying that i should of come and asking if i could come now.   not having anything to do that night i made plans with my sister and told her that i couldn't come. she then instantly got pissed of at me and got really angry with me. she then got taling about how we are different and then sent these messages:   her - 'i still think what its like to be with other guys! and that doesn't mean i dont love you but its still there. all the time in the back of my head. and i still fell the same way as i did about (another guy) at the start of our relationship! i always think about it!"   then i asked "you feel the same way about me as (another guy)?   which she replied with   "i dont know what i want! i dont want to loose you but i want to do other things!"   then i said " well you cant have both, what do you mean by other things"   then she said "Well i just want to see what its like being with some one elset to feel what its like to be single and do what i want. i dont want to loose you tho"   then i said "no but right now your saying you want to break up and how am i ment to feel when i dont want to!"   which se replied with "i dont want to break up i just, idunno... i still want to be with you but i want to be able to see what its like"   this has been stuck in my head for days and i cant help thinking about her with another guy. did she say this because we where fighting and she was  losing the argument or does she really mean it?? over the last day and a bit she hasn't been acting her self while she is messaging me eg not replying or replying very bluntly but it has got better today. is it just because shes still pissed or is she sick of this relationship where as a week ago the thought of cheating on me to her made her cry.   sorry if this doesn't make much sense but i had to ask theres so many thoughts going through my head about my girlfriend who im in love with  please help reddit!!Summary:
I asked her if she still wanted me to come to her house. I felt like she didn't want me to come when I saw her in a week and a half. Later that night, she told me that I had to come and ask if I could come now.
I don't want you to want "I don't want you to" I made plans yesterday to see my girlfriend who lives 2 hours away, and that I was dating for 8 months. Our relationship was really good until now. Friday arvo I asked her if she still wanted to see her home 2 hours away, in which she answered "yeah, if you want, but if you don't mind in the not disturbed x" followed by "actually no, I don't want you to see me cos il play bad" so I said ok not worry about that I'll come. This made me feel that they don't want me to come back if I don't come back. she then immediately pissed at me she really got angry at me. she then has to say that I can come and ask if I could come now. nothing to do that I have plans with my sister and told her that I couldn't come.
Summariz: so yesterday I had made plans to go see my girlfriend who lives 2 hours away and who had been dating for 8 months. our relationship has been going very well so far. Friday Arvo asked her if she still wanted me to come and see her at her house 2 hours away where she answered "yes if you want but if you don't bother me x" followed by "actually no, I don't want you to see me play because play bad" so I said ok don't worry about this I won't come then. this made me feel like I didn't want to come and see her when I haven't seen her in a week and a half. later that night she told me that I would like to tell me what I had to say now. I have nothing to do with my sister and I told her I couldn't go to the head.
Summarize: I was a florist for years, most people think its a wonderful job. Though it was lovely on Valentines day, Mother's Day etc, people don't understand how dirty/smelly it can be sometimes!   Then there's the funerals. It feels wonderful to help people choose the flowers that help them to say goodbye. Most people would think its sad, but I loved it! We often had people coming in to say thank-you, that the deceased would have loved them; or even that they took them home because it would be a shame to leave them.Summary:
Summarize: I guess this is a personal issue, a pattern I've noticed before.   I'm interested in a guy, I think he's attractive/cute, and I want to talk to him, we talk, I meet him, blah blah, and the minute he starts showing interest, I stop feeling interested, just a bad habit.   I also push guys away, the minute they start getting closer, that's when it's over.  I see it, as  "Hey, yes, I want your attention. I would love to have it, and I would love to know you want to get to know me, bc I'm interested in getting to know you. But don't show interest, because it will scare the shit out of me."   It's actually pretty weird, because I crave that attention from guys I like, and when I receive it, I'll be like "fuck off, I don't want this".   Do you also do that?   If you have done it before, and you no longer do it, what did you do to avoid fucking shit up?Summary:
Summarize: I have thought about this before and while i think it is an interesting idea I think having actual crew members, like they currently have industry teams, is kind of pointless.  What I think would be interesting is that since your ship already has a crew in place those crew members could offer a small buff to your ship as time goes along.  For instance, if you are a PVP pilot and you take your Proteus out into a fight, and make it back alive, then your crew gets a buff to help you with DPS and Armor (depending on your ship set-up).   That buff would be only a small number, not enough to outright win the next fight, but it could help you to have a tangible reward for using a ship and surviving a fight.  Also, this would offer a bit more of a reality to the loss, losing your "Best Ship" means you have to start the buffing cycle over again.   This way your ship is becoming better at what you intend to do with it.  Using Mining lasers with a Hulk will give your crew members "XP" in mining proficiency, therefore allowing you a little more yield the next time you run out to the belts.  It would all be based off of what modules you use, and that would return your time and efforts with a little boost in stats.Summary:

Plus, it would offer a little more of a reality to loss, losing your "Best Ship" means that you need to start the buffing cycle again.
To sum up: I have thought about this before and I think it is an interesting idea that the real crew members, as they currently have industry equipment, is something pointless. What I think would be interesting is that as your ship already has a crew in place, those crew members could offer a small buff to your ship as time goes by. For example, if you are a PVP pilot and you take your Proteus to a fight, and you make it back alive, then your crew gets a buff to help you with DPS and Armor (depending on your craft configuration). That buff would be just a small number, not enough to directly win the next fight, but it could help you have a tangible reward for using a ship and surviving a fight. Also, this would offer a little more than one reality to lose, losing your "best ship" means that you have to start the cycle of buffing again, but it could help you have a tangible reward for using a ship and surviving a fight.
Summarize: Basically, people(including me) are turning off their internet for a few seconds, then turning it on, giving them unlimited clicks for at least 4 and a half hours. This is because when your internet starts back up, your MsPs (Modem Speed Per Second) goes back to its default (0), and since this is now a cached link because the internet was turned off, the link is unable to limit the amount of clicks you are allowed to use, granting unlimited clicks until the MsPs climbs back to the regular (on average) 648.3 MsPs :)Summary:
Summarize: I used to work at a grocery store, one night there was a huge thunderstorm and the power went out.  A friend (who is a blackbelt) and I were walking around getting every one out of the aisles, when his flashlight died, so I had to use the small one on my phone.  All of a sudden, we heard some noises coming from the milk/dairy room.  When we went to check it out, there was a group of homeless guys eating yogurt/cheese, and when they saw us, pulled knives.  One tried to attack my friend, but he disarmed him.  Luckily our manager heard it, and called the police.Summary:
Summarize: FiveSensesAreReal :  ^^original ^^reddit ^^link     It has really been great recently to see the Windows NT 4, Service Pack 2, (NT4SP2, or just SP2) events come to a brighter light.  With all the light shining out from Edward Snowden, many people are examining this cryptic symbol ( p.i. ) and attempting to distill greater meanings.  I am here to assist.   Let me be the first to say that Microsoft Windows contains a great many real "backdoors."  It is widely reported that the U.S. government uses these backdoors for various purposes:  The DoJ/FBI has its "Magic Lantern" for use in criminal investigations and counter-intelligence investigations.  Various signal-gathering efforts might use these backdoors in the military and intelligence community -- who knows?   A little bit about me, with no proof forthcoming.  My Microsoft employee number was in the 30000-39999 range.  I could say more but who cares -- any technical person will realize what I say is clearly obvious and lots of non-technical rabid people will call me a fool.  So let's get on with this.   First, let's define a "backdoor."  In my book, a backdoor is a thing that gives a person who is not authorized, access.  There are physical backdoors, local software backdoors, and, scariest, remote access backdoors.  The last category is when some spooky character on the DARPAnet can watch what you are doing on your computer.  Let's focus on "remote access backdoors."   We already know there are lots of Remote-Access Backdoors in Windows.  Let's call them RABs.  To see proof of RABs, look in Microsoft's "Update Tuesday" releases.  There are plenty of "remote code execution with privilege escalation" problems being fixed each month.  Those are RABs.  There must be 10,000s of them in Windows.   The NSAKEY is not one of them.   The NSAKEY is a part of the Windows login system.  It allows NSA to replace the password box.  What they replace it with is like a palm-scanner or an eyeball scanner type of biometric device.  This is to allow a government copy of NT to use 5-factor authentication: password, smartcard, palm, eyeball, and performance on drum machine.   If you want an eyeball reader for your computer, you can get MS to sign your msgina module, after they inspect it.  If NSA wants an eyeball reader, they sign their own module, thanks MS, we don't need you to proofread it, we aren't selling it.   Of course it is true that the NSAKEY could be used to infiltrate a computer, similar to a backdoor.  I am saying that nobody would not do it that way.  To do so would leave a signed DLL trace, as well as all the system log around loading that module.  This NSAKEY lacks the "Repudiation" of STRIDE metric fame that a dark hat seeks.   Quite the contrary, a sneaky spooky backdoor intruder would not leave a file behind.   So, fellow worriers about the watchers and whether anybody is watching them, and, if so, then to what end: stop worrying about NSAKEY and start worrying about all the RABs known to NSA.  These are also called the "Zero Days" which is short for "Zero Day Exploits."Summary:

Summarize: Discussions on how to make Rod of Atos viable are a perennial favorite of this subreddit and here I offer some additional suggestions.  1) Guinsoo used to apply the an ability similar to "Break" but it was removed.  Since Silver Edge is not a viable option for those in Support / Utility heroes, there are many heroes who have no way to apply a "Break" debuff.  Perhaps Guinsoo could be combined with Rod of Atos to form a stronger staff that applies "Break" (like Guinsoo used to).  This would be similar to the new "Bloodthorn".  Atos and Guinsoo both apply a slow so the only addition would be the application of "Break".  2) Another thought is that there are limited ways to burn mana, and Necrobooks and diffusal blades are only viable for certain roles.  Perhaps Rod of Atos could be upgraded in some way so that its active also burns mana.   Just some thoughts, not sure if they would really be viable.  I am a long-time support player and often think about the things that we are unable to do (hard to mana burn, hard to "Break").  Thanks for your thoughts!Summary:

Two days later, she comes over and we hook up again.   We set a date to hang out the following weekend but she ends up having to cancel because she forgot about a birthday that she had to attend but we end up rescheduling for the following Monday.

The texting goes back and forth for a few more days and then during the weekend she tells me she's getting sick   On Monday, the supposed day of the date, I reach out to her and she said she has to cancel and her roommate is probably taking her to the hospital.   After that, just not much texting and I respect that because it sounded pretty bad. But on Weds she's posting to social media and looks pretty healthy.   I end up texting her and ask what her sched is like for the week and she said her grandparents are really sick and they're flying in with her parents... but she's down to hang out the following week.     At this point it seems like a series of unfortunate events but I'm just wondering what the hell happened to all the chemistry when it was clear that we were having a good time?   **UPDATE: I texted her today (waited 5 days) and she was responding as normal. Asked what she was doing and she said she was hanging out with her mom and that she wanted to coordinate a meetup this week. The story she had about her grandparents are true as well (shows on social media). Only problem is when I asked her what day is best she said 'she honestly doesn't know because it depends on how the grandparents are doing'Summary:

Summarize: Details:  I am 23, he is 25, been together 2 years.  We both had the hots for each other for a while before getting together and when we started dating things moved very fast and all was sunshine and puppies.  We both graduated last May (him master's, me undergrad) and moved to a new city together because I found a great job, and he has since been in and out of employment, returning to school for a semester, etc.  He is now employed but his job is not in his field and he is not very satisfied with it.  Since graduating our dynamic changed due to his employment situations (I have been supportive but careful not to be coddling), and also I tried BC for a while and it messed up with my hormones and I acted totally different than myself (crying a lot).  But recently our relationship has changed a lot.   I am going to preface this by saying I do NOT fish for compliments.  I do ask my boyfriend if he likes the way something looks on me so I will remember to wear it more often/less around him.  For such questions I don't expect more than a yes or no.   But, my boyfriend isn't great at giving compliments in general.  I will be dressed to the nines, hair done, smelling delicious, wearing something sexy, and he will glance at me and say without much enthusiasm "You look cute/pretty/nice."  I happen to think cute/pretty/nice is my default when I am not hungover or ill.  For instance, I was in the grocery store picking up his favorite beer before a date, and was dressed pretty sexy (for the date) and two guys whispered to each other "Wow she is a 10!" and when I got home my boyfriend glanced at me and said his typical "You look nice."  I have told him that I wished he used more superlatives, that they are indicative to me that he thinks I am something special.  His response is an eyeroll and "I think you're gawwgeous" in a voice not unlike the Linda Richman from the Coffee Talk skit on SNL.  I am effusive with compliments for him (I tell him he is so effing sexy/so fine I can't help but wait until I can fuck him/etc. because he IS the most attractive man I have met.)  I also equally compliment how funny and smart he is.   We have lived together for over a year and a half, so is that spark just gone?   Our sex life has also changed.  3 months ago I had a herpes outbreak I got from him (I have not cheated on him ever), so we didn't have sex for a month.  In the two months since we also haven't had sex but once a week (I have tried to initiate it but he has to wake up some mornings at 2:00 or 3:00 and by the time we make it to bed it is 10-11).  We used to have teh sex at least once a day.  Now typically the only time we have sex is when he initiates it (I would approximate at least 7/10 instances), and he does that by lying in bed and asking me to lay next to him and then he just starts taking my clothes off (not much sexiness, I just feel like I am a means to an end).  Also, when sexytime arises, he has been asking for BJs instead of sex, which I would willingly oblige (variety is the spice of life) but he does not go down on me (never has since we've been together), and I want to get off too.

Summarize: Two years ago, I was hanging out with a friend at uni, waiting with him for his dad to pick him up. His dad and brother roll up to us, and ask us if we wanted to go to the casino with them (Mind you, I was 18, as was his brother, and he was 20). We decided to go, because fuck it, what else is there to do?   We drive about an hour or so, smoke a couple of joints on the way, and all is going well. We got the casino and started walking around. I figured we were just going to hang out and sight see since we were not of age to gamble.   Well, this was not the case. While I had no money on me, my friend did, and he got some chips to play with. He gave me a $25 chip, and we proceed to sit at a $10 blackjack table, high as shit. Now, mind you, I was pretty scared that someone was going to ask us for I.D. as soon as we entered the gambling area. However, we got through and sat down with no problem.   After a few hours, I had turned my $25 chip into a pocketful of chips, about $275. We left that table, and went to the higher stakes tables, with $50 betting minimums. I broke even, my friend and his brother were up to about $500 at this point. We go to another table, and boy was that a good choice. We ended up sitting with several other folks, one of whom apparently really knew what he was doing, as he was telling everyone when to hit and when to bust, since it would benefit us all. I'd say about 85% of the time he was correct. This dude helped me more than double my money.   At this point, it was about 5 a.m. We decided to collect our money and cash out. I was worried they would ask us for I.D. here, but again, nothing. We cashed out our chips, totaling a little over $2000, and left.   Needless to say, I was psyched, I had $650 in my pocket after going with absolutely nothing, and we had a blast. My friend had left with $1100, and his brother had $440. Feels good, man.Summary:

Summarize: Hello!   I recently purchased the Tobh Atty atomizer (a clone). Today while I was running about (literally, I was late for an appointment) I pulled my Atomo with the Tobh Atty out of my pocket. The atomizer somehow popped off and I'm assuming this is when I lost the bottom screw/pin on the atomizer, so now there is no connection to fire my ecig.   I looked everywhere and couldn't find the pin, so I called and stopped by a few local shops and none of them held the screw. One local shop said any hardware screw of the right size would work as long as the screw didn't come in contact with the threads, but this is still somewhat new to me and I have no idea what kind of screw to get and don't want to short my unit.Summary:

Summarize: All vice prohibitions are great for the prison-industrial complex and great for organized crime, while at the same time being horrible for everyone else.  Laws against victimless pleasures simply create victims by driving an unstoppable variety of commerce into the black market.  Whatever public health problems drugs may actually pose, criminal justice responses are never even slightly effective as solutions.   American drug laws transform millions of harmless and basically decent people into adversaries of law enforcement.  They also channel many billions of dollars in consumer spending away from legitimate businesses and into the hands of criminal syndicates.  Actual vice participation is generally shaped by cultural forces, with even the most draconian regimes having minimal impact.  China continues to execute large numbers of opium traffickers in any given week because even their brutal extremism cannot eradicate the demand for opium.  There is no way to "fight hard enough" to defeat a vice through violence.   Worse still, to the extent that there are real public health problems related to drugs; harm reduction strategies are profoundly undermined by the covert nature of black market commerce.  Addicts often do not seek treatment for fear of social and professional consequences that may follow from admitting that a problem exists in the first place.  Secrecy prevents charitable organizations from having an effective outreach as well.   Sensible lifesaving measures like needle exchanges are difficult to fund and implement because narrow-minded moralists become outraged at any tolerance for illegal activity.  Also, in a post-prohibition environment, the availability of reliable doses of uncontaminated supplies would do wonders to reduce the health problems posed by various forms of recreational drug use.  The number of people injured or killed in violence related to drug law enforcement is only the tip of the iceberg -- beneath the surface lurks the legions of fatalities and countless escalating addictions because of the uncertainty involved in supplies of "street drugs" vs. the sort of well-regulated production and labeling standards one sees with alcohol distribution.   Then there is the financial matter.  Of course a paradigm shift would save enormous amounts of public funds while also providing a new revenue stream in the form of taxes on previously illegal commerce.  The economy would be dramatically stimulated with perhaps as many as 1 million consumers and potential workers are liberated from prisons and permitted to rejoin society.  Since secrecy is the primary component of cost for drugs, prices would plummet.  This would have the secondary effect of virtually eradicating that component of property crime caused by addicts in need of a fix.Summary:

Summarize: The claim is that the memories are actually stored in the specific neuron s  that were excited during the event. In this case the event is a rather robust noxious (read painful, aversive) stimulus of an electric shock.   A genetic marker for neuronal excitation was used to mark the cells that were activated with a light sensitive ion channel. The researchers can then come back and hit the brain with light and excite these and only these cells (which happen to be sparse, a major aspect of the finding). When they do this, the mice react as if they are being shocked. The interpretation is that the memory is being recalled because the only cells that should respond to light are ones that responded to the original shock. One set of controls indicate that the activation-induced labeling is specific to context (the mice had to be shocked to have a memory recalled that would induce fear). Another set of controls labels a broad population of cells and cannot elicit fear behavior upon stimulation.Summary:

Summarize: I can only speak from my own experience in this subject, but here it goes.   I worked 17 years in the building trades as a construction electrician. In the building trades, it's simple; if you don't work, you don't get paid. Outside of injury or medical compensation, your pay is based strictly on hours worked. If you are willing to work more hours, you will get more money. If you only want to work eight-hour days, five days a week, then you will only get 40 hours pay at the standard rate (which was $45.00/hour when I was in the trades). If you want to work 12 hours a day, six days a week, you'll get 40 hours pay plus 32 hours pay at time and a half. If you were willing to put in a Sunday, then you got the above pay plus another 12 hours at double time...you get the point, right?   In my home state, very severe legislation was passed that pretty much forced the building trades to actively recruit minorities and women (yes, I separated it on purpose, as this is how it was promoted) into their apprenticeship programs (which is how I got in as an African American male) in order to continue to receive state and federal funding.   So, they did just that; they actively pursued getting women into the apprenticeship schools and getting them into the field. Guess what? All of the 23 women in my class and the two classes under me washed out of the program. But guess what, there were seven in the class ahead of me and they made it through to the end, and of that seven, three are still working in the trades (one of them is my cousin).   Let's break it down and see what happened. Eight couldn't continue due to pregnancy. Guess what? There are jobs that are just flat out impossible to do because of pregnancy. That isn't about "gender roles;" that is about biology. There is no legislation in the world that can allow a pregnant woman be able to effectively carry out manual labor without endangering herself or the child she is carrying.   The eight women were granted maternity leave from the program to deal with their children. But most building trade apprenticeship programs deal with a "work-hour requirement" for graduation. While the women were not penalized for taking the time off from work and classes and were financially compensated by the union for time they were off work, they could not be given completion credit for hours they did not work. So rather than just accept the fact that they would graduate from the apprenticeship program at a later time than the rest of us, these women just chose to quit the program.   The other 15 women just dropped out of the program after deciding that they didn't want to do the work in the job environment or work the hours required. In construction, especially within the industrial sector, there is a lot of required overtime on projects. Again, this has nothing to do with "gender roles." This is about getting a job done and meeting a deadline. When we are doing a maintenance cycle on a steel mill's blast furnace, we have to be in and out of that area within a given amount of time, so the furnace can be brought back up to production. So, if we're working 12-16 hour shifts for three to five days to get this done, then we're doing it and of course we get paid quite well for that effort.   Most of the women who quit were unhappy because they weren't working in "clean environments" like houses, shopping centers, or office buildings, but were in industrial environments (steel mills, refineries, chem plants, etc... dirty jobs), despite the fact that this was the majority of the work in our area. Commercial and residential work was not as available as industrial jobs at the time.   Four of the women tried to sue the building trades commission in the area for discrimination. They claimed that they were forced to work in the industrial areas rather than getting the commercial and residential jobs because they were women and it was an attempt to discourage them from staying in the program. The case was dismissed because there was overwhelming evidence that proved otherwise. When I joined the program, all of our class were spread out among all of the industrial jobs that were going on during the initial pre-apprenticeship period of the program. Once we all cleared that probation period, we were all pulled out of those jobs and placed into residential and commercial jobs to learn the nuts and bolts of our trade. The final nail in the coffin of that case was that eight other women out of the group came forward and testified that they just quit because they wanted to do something else and denied any discriminatory treatment.   It's all about choice. Are you being physically damaged by working at Starbucks as compared to digging a ditch? There are women who work in construction and they make great money doing it, but they will not lie and tell you that any woman can do it, because not every woman can and the reason is not physical ability, but because of the choices involved. My cousin worked nearly nine months of overtime jobs (nothing less than 6/12's) in the mills to afford to be able to take off for three years for maternity. When she decided to go back to work, she was able to get a job with a contractor to work 7-3:30 on a service truck. (BTW, her husband owns his own computer repair shop out of the house, so he kept the kid during the day.)Summary:
I can't talk about my own experience in this subject, but here it goes. I was working 17 years in the building trades as an electrician. In the building trades, it's simple; if you don't work, you don't get a salary. Apart from the injury or medical compensation, your salary is strictly based on the hours worked. If you're ready to work more hours, you'll get more money. If you only want to work eight hours a day, five days a week, you'll only have 40 hours of salary at the standard rate (which was $45.00/hour when I was in the trades). If you want to work 12 hours a day, six days a week, you'll have 40 hours of salary plus 32 hours of salary on time and a half. If you were ready to put in a Sunday, then you have the above salary plus 12 hours of double-time work... you get the point, okay? In my original state, very strict legislation has been passed to force the building trades to recruit minorities and women from there, because women have lost a job.
I have worked for 17 years in the construction industry as a construction manager. In the construction industry it is easy; if you don't work, you don't get paid. Outside the injury or medical compensation, your pay is worked strictly after hours. If you are willing to work more hours, you get more money. If you want to work only eight hours, five days a week, then you get to pay only 40 hours at the standard rate (that was $45.00/hour if I was in the professions). If you want to work 12 hours a day, six days a week, you will pay 40 hours plus 32 hours to pay time and one half. If you were willing to put in a Sunday, then you have to pay the above plus another 12 hours to double time... you get the point, right? In my home state, very heavy legislation has forced the construction industry to work so much that work is carried out in a Sunday, then in the education, into the training programs as they are able to be the federal schools as they are at home.

Summarize: My partner and I are looking for a home. Our only stop so far has been a local credit union to look at what our monthly payment would be. We want to get pre-qualified (we think) but things have gotten a bit confusing.   We were told by an agent that we could get a "letter" of some sort that would allow us to shop around for rates. We've also been told that a mortgage broker will shop around for the best rates for us. However, the couple "mortgage brokers" we've been referred to have actually turned out to be loan officers/direct mortgage bankers and have said they won't be shopping our information to different lenders.   Are you able to request that a mortgage broker look into specific lenders (such as credit unions or insurance companies we're a part of)? We've been told getting pre-qualified won't affect our credit…but a couple outlets I've looked into have requested authorization to run a full credit check to do so?Summary:
Summarize: I think that part of the reason the Amerigermans tend to stick to the area they emigrated to and/or vote conservatively (if they stayed in their original area and tend to vote conservatively; i don't actually know if this bit is true) is because these are the descendants of Germans of the pre-imperial days when Prussia started invading other german-speaking european countries.   Most of what is Germany now was essentially a large set of independent states that broke up after the fall of the holy roman empire. The first person to comprehensively conquer what is now germany was Napoleon, which led to the first wave of emigrants. The second wave left after Germany was liberated, shortly before Prussia became a serious threat.   Then Prussia led an Italian-style war of unification, which ended with the formation of the second empire. Same thing happened again: a wave of germans left the country seeking stabler lands. After generations of conflict, hunger and the occasional massacre, the emigrants came to America with a deep-seated wariness of change and people that were "foreign" to them. They passed these values down through succeeding generations, and though a lot of them have broken cover and accepted modern values, there is quite a large retainer of old-schoolers who, whether aware of it or not, still embrace the values they were taught by succeeding generations of emigrants.Summary:
Let's sum up: I think part of the reason that the Americans tend to stick to the area where they emigrated and/or vote with caution (if they stayed in their home region and tend to vote with caution; I don't know if it is true) is because it is the descendants of the Germans of the pre-imperial era where Prussia began to invade other German-speaking European countries. Most of what is now Germany was essentially a large group of independent states that broke down after the fall of the Holy Roman Empire. The first person to conquer completely what is now Germany was Napoleon, which led to the first wave of emigrates. The second wave that left after the liberation of Germany, shortly before Prussia became a serious threat.
In summary, I think that part of the reason why the Amerigermans in the area to which they emigrated and/or choose conservatively (if they remained in their original territory and rather conservative; I don't really know if that's true) is because these are the descendants of the Germans of the pre-imperialist days when Prussia began to invade other German-speaking European countries. Most of what Germany is now was essentially a large number of independent states that broke after the fall of the Holy Roman Empire. The first man who conquered comprehensively, what was now Germany Napoleon, who led to the first wave of emigrants. The second wave to Germany was liberated shortly before Prussia became a serious threat. Then Prussia waged an Italian war of unification that ended with the formation of the second empire. The same thing happened again: a wave of Germans left the country to look for more stable countries. After generations of conflicts, hunger and occasional massacres, the emigrants came to America with a deep vigilance of conversion and people who taught it to them, although they were taken over by a crowd.
To sum up: I think part of the reason the Amerigermans tend to stick to the area they migrated to and/or vote conservatively (if they stayed in their original area and tend to vote conservatively; I don’t really know if this is true) is because these are the descendants of the Germans of the pre-imperialist days when Prussia began to invade other German-speaking European countries. Most of what is now Germany was essentially a large group of independent states that broke after the fall of the Holy Roman Empire. The first person who completely conquered what is now Germany was Napoleon, who led to the first wave of emigrants. The second wave went after Germany was liberated, shortly before Prussia became a serious threat. Prussia then led a unification war in the Italian style, which ended with the formation of the second empire. The same happened again: a wave of Germans left the country in search of more stable lands. After generations of conflict, hunger and occasional slaughter, migrants came to America with deep concern and people who “stop” them.
Summarize: The Mario team has been very clear in recent Iwata Asks about their "form follows function". Their key to design in Mario is that everything - spikes, turtles, fans, springs - does exactly what it looks like it should, and you can tell exactly what it does just by looking at it.   The problem, I think, is that they've gotten too good at it. The bosses are all function and no form, or at least certainly no flair. This is especially true in the Galaxy games, where the bosses are set up in a very specific way - the level leading up to them teaches you something, and the boss tests you on what you've learned. Tarantox and Sling Pods; Bouldergeist and Bomb Boos; Rollodillo and Rock Mario; etc. And that's it. What do we know about, say, Glamdozer? She's got a soft underbelly, and you're supposed to attack her with those ground-pound gates, and she's mad at you, and that's all there is to her. Defeat her in the way that is immediately obvious and then proceed to forget her.   The bosses in 64 and Sunshine are a bit different. First, the way they're defeated isn't  immediately  obvious. We haven't been primed the whole level to use one specific mechanic and then apply it on the boss - we're required to take what we know about  all  of Mario's moves and figure out what's relevant. Even if they have big glowy weakpoints, we don't immediately know what we're going to use to get there. Some bosses have a painfully unsubtle monologue, or are spoiled early by F.L.U.D.D., but there's at least a  little  more mystery.   Secondly, they fit a little better into the world. In SM64, the bosses all give a little speech before and after defeat - talking about their loyalty to Bowser or their distrust for Mario intruding on their home, letting us know  why  we're fighting them. In Sunshine, the bosses generally have NPCs complaining about them, plus they usually create, and come from, graffiti. Cleaning up graffiti is both the main story goal  and  fun in its own right, so we don't need to be told twice before butting heads with something like Gooper Blooper. Petey Piranha, in particular, has some great moments of characterization.   Personally, I think Mario games are becoming a little too cold and clean-cut, and not just in their bosses. I think Sunshine was deeply flawed, but I'd like to see Mario start including more world-building elements, instead of just being an over-polished parade of novelties.Summary:

Summarize: Several years ago, my dad bought a book from a second hand shop which had a couple of letter on each page circled. When they were written out, they gave directions to a location in the Wicklow mountains in Ireland, which conveniently are an hours drive south of where I live. So one weekend we decided to follow the directions to see where they went and if whatever had been buried was still there. So after a day of trapesing across valleys and streams (it was sunny at least), we got lucky and found a small wooden box buried under a rock right where the note said it would be. Inside the box we found a number of coins, mostly from Britain around the turn of the century and a Franz Josef medal from 1849. Was a pretty cool experience all in all.Summary:

Summarize: I originally posted this at r/polyamory, because I didn't realize this subreddit existed.   My husband and I - we are both men - are not sexually exclusive. Lately we have been hanging out with this new gentleman. It's our typical arrangement with third parties, which is basically friends-with-benefits. Except, I'm running into a problem. The dude seems to like my husband a lot more than me.   The first night we hooked up, we were all drunk and he was very possessive of my husband and dismissive of me. Kissed my husband deeply, passionately then would give me a peck and go back to my husband. Pushed me away a couple of times. While I  hate  when this happens and how awkward it becomes, I rolled with it because, well, we're not new to this and I know it's not always ideal.   However, the next time we were planning to hang out, I gently mentioned what we'd observed and that if he was only interested in my husband that was totally fine, but that he should let us know. I understand that right here may be one of the biggest variables. He was on the spot and may have not felt comfortable saying what he actually felt. That said, I really think I did a good job of making it clear that it was not a problem to say he preferred my husband, but he needed to say that if it was the case. Maybe he really wanted to but couldn't in that moment. I don't know. But he did say that he was interested in  both  of us, so we tried to proceed as normal.The other two times we've had sex have been sober and a bit more... egalitarian, but still he obviously leans towards my husband. When we all snuggle in bed, he only really tries to snuggle my husband. And lately we both realized that he never responds to my texts, calls, IMs or anything but responds to everything my husband sends him.   So now I'm unsure of how to proceed. I don't have a problem with my husband having solo encounters with guys, so if that was what this person wanted, I might be okay with it. But he specifically said he didn't want that. However, his actions tell a different story and now I'm left confused and more than a little annoyed. They've now established this kind of bond, and I feel on the outside of it. My husband isn't pleased about this either, but doesn't know how to proceed. Wile I want to hang out with this guy, I feel uncomfortable about the idea, because I don't want to feel like a third wheel in my own relationship and I'm also kind of annoyed that he has ignored all my attempts at communication. It just seems kind of rude and unfriendly.   I will admit that this is all made difficult by the fact that it seems like every person we know either loves us both equally or very obviously likes my husband better. Mostly it's equal, but there have been multiple people - friends, family and a bunch of sexual partners - who have obviously gravitated towards him over me. The opposite has never happened. No one has every showed a preference in me. Rationally, I understand that this doesn't matter and I try not to let it get to me. In five years, it really hasn't. But this one was just the straw that broke the camels back and it just bummed me out a bunch.   My question is: how have you guys dealt with an imbalance like this? Further, have you had a third party claim interest in both of you but then behave like he is into only one of you? I really like this dude and would love to be his friend and/or fuckbuddy but I don't want to feel like a third wheel in my own relationship. I know my husband wants to hang out with him again in theory but is also really bothered by what's going on. Any thoughts would be very appreciated.Summary:
Summarize: It's one of those things in life you don't what how you are going to react. My father passed away after a complicated brain surgery from which he never regained consciousness again up until the day he died, 10 days later.   It was a very difficult emotional rollercoaster, because in addition to it, my brother was hospitalized because of a thrombosis he had on the brain. After three weeks of treatment my brother was discharged and the doctors are very optimistic that he is going to recover 98, 100%. The very day he was discharged he arrived at the wake for my father and stayed for a couple of hours.   Look, I don't want to victimize myself or being pitied upon. I didn't know wakes could be so complicated and it is all a big blur in my mind, people coming and going... I remember I introduced her to an uncle she never met before and so far, she knew everyone. Then she went missing, she said she went outside with the family of a friend of mine, but I didn't saw her again until she asked if it would be alright if she went home. I said sure and later, she called me almost weeping to tell me she felt neglected and not part of the family because I didn't introduce her to other people.   I didn't knew what to say except "sorry", but of course, that wasn't enough, se wanted to know her exact place in our relationship, yes, right there on the phone and me still in the wake. I had to go outside to listen to her claims.   The next day, my father's remains were cremated and she was there. To tell the truth, I was distant from her most of the time, I know I did, I was angry at her. We took the ashes to the family crypt and she was there and I was distant too.   Later that day, she apologized, but I am still hurt, I am still angry that during the most difficult day of my life, she was as important if not more important that what was happening to me. And after I told here this, she said it wasn't fair because she said sorry. And she still claims that I was rude to her and didn't give her her place as my partner.   Now I want to dump her, say we are not right for each other (I'm not saying I am perfect, far from it, but I am trying to be honest, but with all this emotion I don't know if I am) and let's move on, but my therapist says I shouldn't rush into making decisions in my emotional state. I think my therapist is right, but it's difficult to live like this for me right now.   Am I being too sensitive? too unforgiving? Thanks Reddit   So,Summary:

Summarize: I’m having some running shoe problems and I wondered if anyone here can advise?  In a nutshell, I am having problems finding a shoe that doesn’t make the sides of my mid-foot hurt after a few minutes of running! It’s driving me insane! (Sorry, this might be a bit long but I will try to give you as much info as possible)   Bit of background: I’m in the UK.  I used to run 20-25 miles a week (usually 5 miles at a time) before I had my daughter, then I had a two-and-half-year hiatus due to pregnancy and generally being a mum.  Just getting back to running now.  At the moment I am running 6k’s, 3-4 times a week and a longer five-miler at the weekend, trying to get my speed and general aerobic ability up.  I’m not quite where I was pre-child, definitely not as fast as I’d like to be but I am getting there! I am largely a pavement runner.  I live in quite a hilly town – in fact I live on the top of a large hill – so my runs are never flat, no matter where I go.   I am a forefoot runner.  My old running shoes, which I LOVED were Brooks Green Silence.  I found them on a sportswear discount website and had purchased a few pairs before they were sadly discontinued. I never went to one of those running specialist shops to get my feet or gait analysed.  After pregnancy, my feet went up a shoe size so sadly the Green Silence are too tight.  Therefore I needed to find another pair of shoes.   First of all, I went back to the sportswear discount website I used before.  I got a pair or Adipure Gazelle 2’s.  I have to say, they were even more comfortable for me than the Green Silence. I was a bit concerned that they pretty much didn’t have any cushioning in the feet and as I am getting older, I was worried about the impact wearing them running would have on my knees. So, I decided not to be such a cheap-ass and treat myself to actually going to a running specialist store to get my feet/gait analysed.   They pegged me as a neutral, forefoot runner with a normal foot arch (which wasn’t anything I didn’t already know! TBH I didn’t find it that useful).  I wore my Gazelle 2’s to the store to show them and I was told they are just for speedwork training and should not wear them for long runs.  They eventually paired me up with a pair or Nike Air Pegasus 33’s WITH a pair of custom moulded insoles (my bank balance took a beating that day!).  These were fine when I tested them out on the shop’s treadmill for a couple of minutes.  However, I found when running outside for more than 10 minutes or so, my feet started to hurt, down the sides of my midfoot on both feet, around the foot arch.  A real burning sensation.  It wasn’t painful enough to stop running.  However, it made my run really NOT enjoyable at all.  I thought I might just need to ‘break in’ the trainers but after five or so runs in them – no better.  I took the custom insoles out – no better.  My feet still hurt, my runs felt like a slog, I was pleased when they ended.   I went back to my Gazelle’s for a run and it was 100% better.  I was still concerned about the impact on my knees though.   So, after some shoe research, I got a pair of Adidas Ultra Boosts (as I read they were good for neutral, forefoot runners and I like the knitted sock feature which the Gazelle’s also have).  Sadly, they are even WORSE for the midfoot pain than the Air Pegasus - I wanted to scream!   So, I have been running in my Adipure Gazelle’s for maybe a couple of months. I do get niggling aches in my ankles and specifically right knee after running, certainly if I’ve had a distance session or a run to work on my speed, so they are definitely not good for the joints.  A prolonged stretch of these areas during cool down doesn’t seem to help.  I clearly could do with a more supportive shoe but I don’t know where to go from here! I am at my wit’s end with this (and I am not made of money, I can’t keep buying running shoes).   So, what I wanted advice on is:   Has anyone else experienced this midfoot pain and what did you do to resolve?  Is it a simple adjustment with the lacing etc.?  Do I need to break the shoes in more?  Or can anyone recommend some good trainers that might help?Summary:
I had a little chance to run, I wondered if anyone here can advise him. In short, I had problems finding a shoe that doesn't hurt the sides of my mid-foot after a few minutes of racing! He drives me crazy! (Sorry, it could be a little long but I'll try to give you as much information as possible) A little background: Im in the UK. I ran 20-25 miles a week (usually 5 miles a week) before I had my daughter, then I had a two-and-a-half-year hiatus due to pregnancy and usually being a mom. Just come back to running now.
I was wondering if anyone can consult here? In a nutshell, I have trouble finding a shoe that didn't make the sides of my mid-foot pain after a few minutes of running! I'm always 20-25 miles a week (usually 5 miles at once) before I had my daughter, then I had a two-and-a-half year old Hiatus due to pregnancy and usually I was a mother. Just running again now, I'm like I am to get it 3-4 times a week and a longer five-molder on weekend, trying to get my speed and overall aerobic ability up. I'm not quite where I was a fore child that I'm not as fast as I am, but I'm getting it to get another to get a ground-level city to do my mountain sports performance.
In short, I have trouble finding a shoe that doesn’t make the sides of my half foot hurt me after a few minutes of running! (I’m sorry, this may be a little long, but I’m going to try to give you some information as normal as possible) A little bit of background: I’m in the UK. I’m running 6k-25 miles a week (usually 5 miles at a time) before I had my daughter, then I had a two-and-a-half break due to a pregnancy and usually being a mother. I’m just running back now. So, it’s not as fast as I’d like to have a more view of my website. After I have a view of more than five my daughter, trying to get my overall speed and aerobic ability up. I’m not very much where I was pre-child, it definitely wasn’t as practical to have a view of the larger shoes.
Summarize: If the title sounds provocative, that's because it's meant to be. I tried out WvW for the first time tonight, and I'm astonishingly disappointed, almost to the point of loathing it.   On one map, there were not very many people, so I was left to wander mostly alone. If I ever encountered an enemy, it would be a group of two or three people who would demolish me in seconds. The only thing I managed to accomplish on this map was provide the armor repairman with record profits.   On another map, there was a huge population. People everywhere. But the only way to survive was to be part of this massive swarming zerg. As soon as I break away from my world's zerg, I get instantly consumed by the enemy zerg. I think I was dead before I even knew it was there. The last thing I want from this game is more freaking zerg content. This game seems to have more zerg in it than Starcraft.   What bothers me most about all of this is remembering how good the PvP was in GW1 Factions. I was anticipating something like Factions but scaled up a  bit . But boy was I disappointed. In Factions, even if you had a 1v2 or 1v3 confrontation, that one person could at least annoy the opposition a bit and maybe manage to run away. It seems that any slightly uneven confrontation here is a sure and swift victory to the side with more people.   So I pose this question to the people who like WvW: what do you actually like about it? I posed this question to my guild, and pretty much all I got back is that it's good for farming karma. Does GW2 provide PvP that would please a Factions fan? I'm starting to feel like I should just return to GW1 if I want any kind of quality PvP enjoyment.Summary:

Summarize: This FU takes place around late 2007 or early 2008 and the details may be slightly off however the experience I had is very vivid in my mind to this day.   During my first year of college I decided to live in the on-campus residence. Each suite is shared by two students. We both share a kitchen with table, chairs, cabinets, fridge, and microwave as well as a bathroom with shower/toilet/sink. Thank god we had our own LOCKED bedrooms. Despite filling out my residence application indicating I prefer a medium-noise level and am a clean person who doesn't party too hard I got matched up with a horrible guy. This dude was from a small town (I'm from the city) and he was the most disrespectful, irresponsible piece of shit I'd ever spent more than a few hours with. Without getting too into detail he was not clean, left piss in the toilet every morning (he'd use it, then close the lid before showering and then leaving the bathroom having "forgotten" to flush). Didn't do dishes till all of them were used, made absolutely ZERO effort to be quiet when my door was closed/I was sleeping. A complete asshole through and through. I hated his guts and I still do. We fought constantly and barely talked. Those 8 months were super awkward and pretty shitty for me. The dumbass was in the firefighter program but I think he failed out. According to his FB profile it looks like he works in a low-wage warehouse job in his hometown.   I was a casual pot smoker during college (more so during first year/part of second year) and would buy small amounts or share with other buddies in the dorm building. It was fun and I always did it when I didn't have classes/assignments that needed to be done. On average, maybe once a week but I don't remember LOL. One Friday night nobody wanted to do anything and I felt like having a little toot of the  reeferino . If I remember right, it was his weed too which he gave me. Again, I don't remember details but I do recall once having some which had a very strong pine chemical smell which may have been what I smoked that night. A few toots and we go back in. I close my door as he's playing his shitty hip-hop music and I'm starting to feel the high coming on. As I begin to take-off my thoughts begin to get fucked-up. I'm sitting alone in my bedroom and I become severely paranoid. All I could think of was that "cool people" are brought up to try to befriend loners (which I somewhat was at the time) so that they don't kill themselves. In their mind, they don't really like them and it's all an established social norm to try to keep loners from offing themselves. These thoughts lasted into early Sunday morning. TIFU (well, not today but it was a FU) This was not a normal high for sure as I had never in my life experienced thoughts like this. I was and still am taking an anti-depressant medication (a very low dose) and either I took it that evening before smoking or the weed I smoked was laced. From then on, I made sure to only smoke around people who I trusted and genuinely felt comfortable with as being high magnifies ones mood exponentially. If you smoke while depressed, you feel more depressed...(for me at least)Summary:

We both share a kitchen with table, chairs, wardrobes, refrigerator and microwave as well as a bathroom with shower/toilet/puce. Thank God we had our own LOCKED rooms. Despite completing my residency request indicating that I preferred a level of average noise and being a clean person who is not too much part of the party once I got pissed in the bathroom each morning (I am from the city) and it was the most disrespectful, irresponsible thing I had ever spent more than a few hours while I remembered that he had not yet finished eating.
I remember that I had a little more than the experience I had very vividly in my head until this day. During my first year of college I decided to live in the on-campus residence. Each suite is shared by two students. We both share a kitchen with table, chairs, closets, refrigerator and microwave as well as a bathroom with shower/WC/sink. Thank God we had our own LOCKED bedrooms. Despite filling out my residence application shows that I was a medium noise level and am a clean person who wasn't partying too hard I was tuned with a terrible guy. This guy was from a small town (I'm from the city) and he was the most disrespectful piece of shit I had ever spent more than a few hours with. Without too much detail he wasn't clean, left piss in the toilet every morning (he would use it before the lid from the city) and he was the most irresponsible piece of shit I had ever spent with me in a few hours.
Add part: This FU takes place around the end of 2007 or early 2008 and the details can be slightly off however the experience I had is very vivid in my mind until this day. During my first year of college I decided to live in the campus residence. Each suite is shared by two students. We both shared a kitchen with table, chairs, cabinets, fridge and microwave as well as a bathroom with shower/toilet/sink. Thank God we had our own LOCKED rooms. Despite filling my residency application indicates that I prefer a medium noise level and I am a clean person who does not party too hard they paired me with a horrible guy. This guy was from a small town (I am from the city) and he was the most disrespectful, irresponsible piece of shit I had spent more than a few hours with. Without going into details he was not clean, let urinate in the toilet every morning (I am from the university also remember it, but I remember it much more well than I did because he was more from the shower and shower.
Summarize: You're probably thinking "another lame BR challenge that will fail in no time, who cares?!" right? Well, I'm not going to let that be the case. The majority of people start these with an initial post and then never even make a first update with the exception of /u/furples, and following strict BRM, time management into studying and playing I WILL complete this challenge, although I know with 100% certainty there will be many, many roadblocks.   There is one main reason I am doing this. I just cashed out a healthy BR which I could play 50NL and MTT's up to $20. So what is the reason for the challenge then? I've had decent success in MTTSNG/MTT, and I feel that cash is the weakest part of my game. I had recently been playing 25NL on Stars for about 5bb/100 over 60K hands which gives me hope to at least return to this limit before things get much tougher. I am currently on Paternity leave, which has allowed me to play MTT's after the wife and baby go to sleep and stay up until whatever time I want to finish them. This all ends next month though when I return to work and will only get 2-3 hours at night to play before bed. I'm in the military so my day starts early when I return and staying up until 2-3 am just isn't an option.   BANKROLL   I cashed out the entire bankroll, and am starting with the $50 given by PS for the "VIP Stellar Rewards." I had sitting in my account. As you can see here,  I have  my $50, around 670 FPP's (used the rest yesterday for online tourney tickets) which I will use for 10-20 FPP $500-1000 Freerolls as I feel that would be the best value for trying to win with them and getting a lot of shots at the tourneys. Also, I'm 1/2 way to my next $50 so in about 2500 VPP's I'll get to add that to the BR as well.   BANKROLL   MANAGEMENT   Of course, I will start at 2NL and build from there. I will take shots at 20BI's for the next limit and drop down if I lose 4BI's there back to 40BI's at the previous limit. Example at $100, I will take a shot at 5NL, If I am unsuccessful at that attempt I will drop back to 2NL at $80 and wait until $100 to shot take again. On Sundays I will play micro tournaments with a strict MAX 1% rule, so until I get going only the $.10-0.50 tourneys will be played.   STUDYING   &  PLAYING   I have roughly one month before I return to work, so during this time I have a little extra wiggle room for both studying and playing and will try to get max value from both until then.   I will spend 30-90 mins daily on actual studying. 6max cash is the main goal to beat for this challenge (aside from Sundays as mentioned) and will be where most of this time is focused. I will be reading everything I can about uNL on 2p2, reading as many .pdf books (Easy Game #1 & 2 for example) as I can find, posting interesting hands on here for you guys, and watching videos on YouTube regarding 6max cash. I will also be watching xflixx's entire "Grinding it Up" series, and Jason's Runitup series also, and hopefully learning from their grinds as well, as this is an entirely new entity for me.   10-30 minutes will be spent daily reviewing hand histories from the previous session to see where I'm making mistakes, where I'm playing well, and helping me better understand the players at each limit I'm at.   Playing time basically all comes down to life. As I do have a wife and son, playing during the day usually isn't an option, but I may get to squeeze some 30 min sessions in now and then. The majority of my time will be spent playing at night, where for this first month I can put in a fairly large chunk of volume time-wise. I'll aim for about 4 hours a night broken into two, 2 hour sessions with a 30 minute break in between to have a snack, collect my thoughts and get refocused for another 2 hours.   TIME   FRAME  &  FINAL THOUGHTS   I am not going to have a specific targeted time frame to complete this challenge as I think that can lead to bad playing if you're nearing the end and have X-amount to reach the goal, which could be disastrous.   I'm not interested in making a thread on 2p2, so I will only post one update a week here, and hopefully that's often enough without being annoying and clogging up the feed here at all. I will always attach a screenshot of my current BR, and anything interesting (to me) that may have happened during the week, things I have learned, books read, etc.   I hope this is enough info for a first update, but if I am missing anything I should have added please let me know and I'll edit it in.   I'm lucky enough to have a smoke show of a wife that puts up with me investing so much of my spare time into a hobby like this. Probably because she wants new shoes and shit down the line lol.   Tonight will be the first night of the grind at 2NL so wish me luck, and I'll put in the effort for the skill portion. Cheers!Summary:
I've had another free challenge that will fail in no time, which will take care of?! isn't it? Well, I'm not going to leave it will.

If most people start with an initial post and then don’t even make a first update with the exception of /u/furples, and following a strict BRM time management to study and play, I will complete this challenge, although I know for sure of 100% that there will be many, many roadblocks. There’s a main reason why I’m doing this. I just charged a healthy BR that could play 50NL and MTT at $20. What’s the reason for the challenge then? I’ve had decent success at MTTSNG/MTT, and I feel that cash is the weakest part of my game. I’ve been playing 25NL at Stars for 5bb/100 more than 60K hands that give me hope to get back to this limit before the $5 return and the $5 return to the $5 bill will be $10.
Summarize: I know this is supposed to be primarily a female sub, but I was hoping I could get some input from any of you who are willing.  Feel free to tell me to get over to /r/predaddit :)   Long story short, my wife and I have had two miscarriages (one at about 8 weeks, the other was barely a missed period).  She's pregnant again, and coming up on 6 weeks.  It's been tough because we're not going to tell anyone until we're well past three months, and we're both very worried about another miscarriage.   Yesterday, while at work, she started spotting, light pink, with some light cramping.  She called her doctor and was told it's probably nothing but to go home and take it easy for the rest of the day.  She did so, I met her there, and she seems okay now, basically spent the evening napping, with a lot of nausea (but no vomiting).  The spotting seems to have stopped.  I've read previous posts about this kind of thing here, and it sounds like this is not at all unusual.   I was just hoping there might be some folks here who have gone through this and are willing to just give me some reassurance that it's routine and isn't cause for worry.  It's tough, not being able to talk about this with anyone, and I know it doesn't help for me to be constantly asking her if she's still cramping, or if there's more spotting.  I'm trying to keep her mind off it and let her rest but I'm also going a little crazy inside with worry.Summary:
I know it's supposed to be a sub-wife, but I was hoping I could get some comments from you who are ready. Don't hesitate to tell me to go to /r/predaddit :) Anyway, my wife and I had two miscarriages (one at about 8 weeks, the other was barely a missed period). She's still pregnant, and she's coming to 6 weeks. It's hard because we're not going to tell anyone for three months, and we're both very worried about another miscarriage. Yesterday, during her work, she started to spot, light pink, with some light cramps. She called her doctor and we said it was probably nothing but going home and taking it easily for the rest of the day.

She is pregnant again and comes to 6 weeks. It was hard because we didn't say anyone until we were good after three months, and we are both very worried about another miscarriage. Yesterday while she was at work, she seems now, basically spent the evening napping, with a lot of nausea (but no vomiting). She probably has nothing else but to go home and take it just for the rest of the day.

I've read that this kind of things here and it's not possible, it's too hopeful and it's not common for all the people.
Sumar: I know this is supposed to be mainly a female submarine, but I was hoping to get some information from any of you that is willing. Feel free to tell me that I will go to/r/predaddit :) Brief story, my wife and I have had two miscarriages (one in about 8 weeks, the other was just a lost period). She is pregnant again, and comes in 6 weeks. It has been difficult because we are not going to tell anyone until we are well past three months, and we are both very concerned about another miscarriage. Yesterday, while at work, she started to spot, clear pink, with some light cramps. She called her doctor and told her that it is probably nothing more than going home and taking it easily for the rest of the day. She did so I met her there, and she seems to be fine now, basically she spent the nap of the night, with a lot of nausea (but there is no vomiting).
Summarize: I am Sr. Graphic Designer for a fairly large company. We used to do 99% print design, 1% web. We've recently moved the web design in-house and our department has taken the brunt of it. We probably produce more web than print at this point. We do all the web graphics, email blasts (design and code) and web banners (static, animated and basic Flash). When my review comes up later this year, is it at all inappropriate to ask for a title change to Sr. Graphic and Web Designer and a slightly bigger salary to go along with it? I took web design classes on my own time and dollar so we could transfer this work in-house.Summary:
Summarize: Basically, [this](   Look, the important thing to keep in mind is - ALL art is subjective. No art is beautiful to every human ever. That said - minding the art critics is folly and really only something to do if you actually enjoy over-analyzing things. (Which isn't to say it's BAD - I personally love it if I love the artwork!)  Just don't put too much stock in it.   Anyways, most art is going to be critiqued in the following format: Description, Analysis, Interpretation, Judgment.   What are you looking at.  What materials were used? Clay, marble, granite, canvas, plaster, oil paint, acrylic, encaustic? Predominate shapes, colors, lines, textures, etc.   How does it all come together?  Does the work seem to flow or move? How do the colors or textures work with or against each other? Where is your eye drawn? Is it sensual? Is it shocking? What is it saying?   What do you get out of it?  Sure, it's obviously trying to say x, but what are YOU hearing? How does it make you feel? What does it make you think of? Is it evoking a memory or an emotion? How do you react to the work.   Is it good or is it crap?  Explain what works and what doesn't work. This should be easy, and the previous parts should have built momentum up to this.   After it's all said and done though, you have to bare in mind that art is an intensely personal experience. The more broad and mainstream a work is - the less daring and evocative it's likely to be. This is why there are so rarely artists who are considered geniuses during their day in the modern art world.   Bare in mind, you might be a nobody today who put a cheap crucified Jesus in a jar of urine and displayed it in a high-powered art show, but 200 years from now in our future heavily scatological excretion-based society you will be retroactively viewed as a visionary genius of unparalleled simplicity.Summary:

Interesting statement from the article. Quite poetic in regard to every photographer who didn't pay sales tax is now getting hit with it.     The entire website al.com is garbage.

A lot of photographers tried working around this by abusing "sitting fees." Sitting fees are for photographers who are worried clients wont purchase prints. But that's not how things work anymore. I haven't seen a wedding contract without digital prints on it in years. Regardless, no Alabama law excludes sitting fees from taxes.     Someone went to court over this back in 2014 and lost. And it painted a big bright light on photographers and the state is now turning their attention to those who avoided taxes for shooting weddings.Summary:

Summarize: Haven't seen one of these yet, figured some people might have questions about drumming or drummers in general.   How I became a drummer:   I first became interested in music as something more than an idle distraction when I listened to Rush's "A Farewell To Kings" when I was 10 or 11. Made me completely change the way I thought about music. I started playing guitar right around that time, self-teaching myself and learning how to play (mostly Rush) songs. During late elementary school I went through a major songwriting phase, but it kinda died off in High School (to this day I wish it didn't, but I can't argue with musical writer's block...)   I actually started playing drums proper in Grade 9. My maternal grandfather was a big band drummer years back, and had a really old kit at his house I would mess around with from time to time, and I had a fairly natural sense of rhythm and beat right from the getgo. When grade 10 came, I was eligible to play in the school Jazz Band. I originally tried out on guitar, but I've never been particularly good at it, and have quit in the years since, so I didn't make the audition. Then, my music teacher, who had seen me mess around a bit behind the kit in grade 9 music, asked me if I wanted to try out for drums. I said "Sure, I'll give it a shot." I showed up to the audition without owning, nor ever actually playing, a full kit before (my grandfathers was a 2-piece snare + bass, with hihats and a crash/ride). My competition were two Niner Punk drummers who were terrible, a grade 11 who smacked the drums so hard he gave the teacher a headache (his words!), and myself: all I played for him was a basic swing beat, and apologized with "Sorry that's really all I know". He said "Don't worry: you have the feel. That's what they lack. You can learn the rest." I played 4 years of HS jazz band (Musicfest Canada Gold 1 year [12], Silver 3 years [10-11, 13]), then stopped playing to go to Uni. Did a year of that, got sick of it and came back home, got a double-kick pedal from my parents for my 20th birthday, and have been rocking out ever since (22 now)!   Kit: Tama Swingstar (got it half-way through Grade 10 when I decided I needed to practice at home too ;-)), 5-piece. Sabian B8 14" Hi-Hats Zildjian A 6" Splash Zildjian A 12" Splash Sabian XS 16" Crash Zildjian A 16" Thin Crash Zildjian ZBT 18" Crash/Ride Zildjian A 21" Sweet Ride Zildjian A 20" Medium Ride Cowbell Double-kick pedal   Picture:   Sticks: Promark 5A or 747 (Neil Peart Signatures)   My Idols: Neil Peart and Mike Portnoy. I respect tons of other drummers but my style is definitely a fusion of those two guys more than anything else. I play (and listen to) a lot of Rush and Dream Theater!   So, AMA.   (This is my first AMA, sorry if I'm not able to answer many questions tonight, but I will tomorrow at work for sure!)Summary:

Summarize: I got relatively sudden suicidal thoughts last Friday, and then after that I have gotten to a point where I feel like those thoughts are from another person, and right now I'm not sure. My personal background is that when summer came I just hung out with my parents, didn't leave the house much, and my friends are all away so I just sit around. It seems like night time is when I get the majority of the thoughts. I wake up maybe an hour after going to sleep, even if I was really tired, and there's a bad feeling in my stomach, and I feel really, really low. Today's been a rough day, but here is my question:   Are these with me forever? I feel awful and I've dealt with the feelings for less than a week, and there are people who have had them for more than 10 years. I don't want these forever. I saw the Askreddit post where some guy said he was happy, but still wanted to die, making me think these are something you can't escape, just try to ignore as long as you can. I have personally thought of suicide before this, in a really narcissistic "what would they do if I was gone, they would be so sad" way, but never the scary way where I feel like the thoughts are a disease until recently. Right now, one of the biggest things keeping me far away from the urges is the impact it would have on family, but I see people so worn down by the thoughts that they don't let it stop them.

My personal experience is that when the summer came I just came to hang out with my parents, I didn't leave the house much, and my friends are all absent, so I just come to sit around. It seems that the time of night is when I get the majority of thoughts. I may wake up an hour after I slept, even if I was really tired, and there's a bad feeling in my stomach, and I really feel, really low.
So I don’t have relatively sudden suicidal thoughts last Friday, and after that I’ve come to a point where I feel like those thoughts are from someone else, and right now I’m not sure. My personal experience is that when summer came I just hung out with my parents, I didn’t go out much of the house, and my friends are all away so I feel really bad. Today has been a tough day, but here’s my question: are these with me forever? I feel horrible and have worried about the feelings of less than a week, and there are people who have had them for more than 10 years. I don’t want these for ever. I saw the Askreddit post where a guy said he was happy, but still wanted to die, and there are people who have had them for more than 10 years. I don’t want them to be forever. I saw the Askreddit people who see them in the way that people make it more difficult, but who see it the way that makes it more difficult.
Summarize: True, that's more an example of a paradoxical fear response than a lacking fear response. Regardless, if you read Dutton's book (which I absolutely encourage you to, it is great), he goes into a lot of depth about exactly why there are biochemical differences in people when it comes to fear response, and why there are a few jobs in society that are done extremely well by pro-social psychopaths.   A great example of a gene that is heavily associated with psychopathy (the talk I linked before with James Fallon goes more into it) is actually nicknamed "the warrior gene":   In that case, varying degrees of underactivity of MAO-A desensitizes the brain to serotonin early in life, resulting in far less of an emotional response to stress later in life. Drugs like Tianeptine accomplish the same thing in a reversible manner, and drugs like Propranolol block the effects farther upstream by preventing the adrenaline response to fear in the first place that triggers a downstream emotional response mediated by serotonin.   Edit:  SoSummary:
In short, if you read Dutton's book (which I absolutely encourage you, it's great), it goes much further on why there are biochemical differences in people when it comes to the response to fear, and why there are some jobs in society that are extremely well achieved by pro-social psychopaths. A great example of a gene that is strongly associated with psychopathy (the conversation that I previously associated with James Fallon goes more into it) is actually called "the warrior gene": In this case, varying degrees of subactivity of MAO-A desensitize the brain to serotonin early in life, resulting in much less emotional response to stress later in life. Drugs like Tianeptine perform the same in a reversible way, and drugs like Propranolol block the effects further upstream by preventing the adrenaline response to fear in the first place that triggers an emotional response downstream mediated by serotonin.
Summarize: True, this is more an example of a paradoxical anxiety response than a lack of anxiety reaction. No matter if you read Dutton's book (which I absolutely encourage, it's great), it goes into a lot of depth about why there are biochemical differences in people when it comes to anxiety reaction, and why there are a few jobs in society that are made extremely well by pro-social psychopaths. A great example of a gene that is strongly associated with psychopathy (the conversation I previously associated with James Fallon goes more into it) is actually nicknamed "the warrior gene": In this case, different degrees of underactivity of MAO-A desensitizes the brain to serotonin early in life, resulting in far less of an emotional reaction to stress later in life. Drugs like Tianeptine reach the same thing in a reversible way, and drugs like propranolol block the effects further forward by preventing the adrenal response to anxiety in the first place, which mediates an after-effectal reaction: Sommary:

Summarize: In a lot of recent patches we've seen a lot of support nerfs, and I know a lot of people have gotten rather mad about this, so I would just like to suggest that Riot focus more on buffs than on nerfs.  Compared to games like DOTA2 supports in league have a rather small impact on the flow of the game, often relying more on using their map awareness to call plays than actually make plays themselves.  Soraka and Janna have been dominating bottom lane, but would it be possible for people like Leona, Taric, Sona, etc. to be buffed rather than Soraka and Janna nerfed? I do know that there are some buffs incoming, but would it be possible to do bigger buffs and smaller nerfs to bring them all to parity?Summary:
Summarize: This isn't something I usually do, but I thought it warranted some attention given that Famous is not only somewhere that many people here frequently order from, but they're also relatively active on here. I was passing through Easton on my way back from some apartment hunting with my girlfriend in North Jersey and knew that Famous's B&M was up there. We figured we'd stop in and see how it looked.   Not knowing what to expect, all I can say is that I was definitely impressed.   They had a great selection up there with good prices on the vast majority of their sticks, including some I've not seen around any of the B&Ms around my area. [I grabbed:](     Warped Flor del Valle   Warped La Hacienda   Cubanacan maduro lonsdale   Viaje Exclusivo   601 Steel     When I got outside to their patio (which was part of the restaurant and bar, and something that I'll get to later), I inspected the sticks. Both Warped sticks and the Cubanacan had some damage, so I went back in to the humidor and the gentleman working there was quick to replace the smokes with no issue. He was very courteous and apologetic about it, making sure I was satisfied before I walked back out of the humidor. I know it's simple and expected, but he handled it very professionally, and as someone who works both in a normal retail situation and part-time in a smaller B&M, I always appreciate getting great service like that.   Now, on to the restaurant/bar portion of the business. While we didn't get any food (stopped at Two Rivers Brewing Company before going there, and the food was fantastic), they had a very solid beer and drink selection, and all of the staff were very friendly. The interior portion had plenty of seating and ashtrays at every table (obviously it was smoker friendly), and the patio was the same.   All in all, I definitely enjoyed my time there - smoked a Viva Republica Propaganda, which was quite tasty - and I'll definitely be dropping by whenever I'm in the area.Summary:

Summarize: A while back, I posted a request to find a cheaper [MFLB]( [here]( $100 was out of my price-range, and I knew the reddit community could help me figure something out. My request got a few replies, some offering sound advice, and one in particular stuck out. A fellow redditor, fellow ent, scarysockpuppet, replied to my post asking for my info to send me an MFLB for free! I was shocked, and like any other, I was obviously skeptical. I knew reddit was awesome, and that fellow ents helped out other ents on a daily basis, but such a thoughtful thing to do from someone is almost unheard-of. I threw caution to the wind, and after a few hours of browsing, I was sent a message with an Amazon tracking number for my gift. Everyone I know was skeptical, but I had such faith in the community that I knew scarysockpuppet wouldn't let me down.   Days passed. I grew more and more anxious. My car was broken into the week before, so this seemed like a little karma coming my way and something I eagerly awaited. I shared my story with anyone that was listening, spreading the ent love and letting others know that somewhere in this world, there is some good shit happening. I waited with patience. The day never arrived.   On Jan. 19th, I was home from work, and checked my mail early to see if it had came. The 19th was the last day of the estimated arrival time. After a few hours, the mail comes, and still no MFLB. I sighed a long sigh, feeling the weight of the United States Postal Service letting me down.   I contacted scarysockpuppet and explained. He gave me the USPS tracking number, and I discovered that the package was delivered on the 15th!! I was at work from 10-6, and the package was marked "delivered" at 3:30pm. I talked to the post office, and after talking with the courier who delivered it, was told that the package was left on my door step. My wife and mother were home, and have both confirmed that no mailman came to the door. A package with a hundred dollars of merchandise, eagerly anticipated, was left on my porch. Now, I can honestly say that I live around elderly people and that my neighborhood has always felt extremely safe. I cannot imagine who would want to steal a package off of a doorstep in broad daylight, much less in my neighborhood.   Scarysockpuppet has put in a claim with Amazon, and I've tried everything I can think of with the post office. The post office supervisor told me that since my neighborhood had a low rate of crime, the couriers just drop packages off in front of a house without a signature. For real.   I had to get this out. After my hopes in humanity are raised with redditor scarysockpuppet, they are agonizingly taken away with the United States Postal Service. With a package being confirmed "delivered", they will no longer take responsibility. Our last hope at redemption lies in Amazon. So far, they have been more than helpful, but I am expecting that nothing will come of that either. I look like a scammer trying to get the same product twice, or money back for something I have. My story is all I have.   Any advice would be wonderful. I have contacted the USPS, Amazon, and the USPS Investigators to resolve this. I have a strong feeling that this wasn't random doorstep-mail theft.Summary:

CLG and TSM can live of their stream revenue and salary, the teams don´t necessarily need to win anything to get money. There is no incentive to scrim 8 hours a day when they can just stream solo queue and chill all day.

Summarize: I live in a collegetown, and one Saturday night I was driving home from my boyfriend's house through campus. Literally the night before there had been a report of rape, and another report of attempted rape in close proximity, about 30 minutes apart. As I'm driving near the place where the reports were made, I see this drunk off her ass girl, clearly a freshman, in a tight skimpy dress walk by carrying her heels, completely alone. Suddenly I'm conflicted, because I don't want her to think I'M going to rape her (even though I'm a girl, you never know sketchy shit can happen) but I also don't want her to be in danger.   So I slow down and roll down my window, and shout out to her, asking if she wants a ride. The funny thing is she was so drunk the thought that I might be dangerous doesn't even cross her mind. She stumbles up to the car window and says in a stupid, sorority girl voice "Whaaat?" So I offer her a ride, explain that I'm not going to hurt her and that there were recently reports of rape in this area, and I just want her to be safe. She gets in the car and directs me to her dorm, the whole time drunkenly rambling about how drunk she was and how her friends ditched her.   She offered to pay me many times, each time I denied. It was a funny experience, and I'm glad I helped her even if she wasn't gonna get raped.Summary:

Sumar: I live in a college neighborhood, and on a Saturday night I was driving home from my boyfriend’s house across campus. Literally the night before there had been a rape report, and another attempted rape report in close proximity, about 30 minutes apart. As I’m driving near the place where the reports were made, I see this drunk girl’s ass, clearly a freshman student, in a tight dress walking around her heels, completely alone. Suddenly I’m in conflict, because I don’t want her to think I’m going to rape her (although I’m a child, you never know that the gruesome shit can happen) but I also don’t want her to be in danger. So I stop and throw myself out the window, and yell at her, asking if she wants a ride. The funny thing is that she was so drunk the idea that she could be dangerous doesn’t even happen to her head.
Summarize: So I was wandering around my local book store the other day, looking for a copy of the Portable Atheist in the religion section.  Naturally, there were bibles galore.  I was tempted to pick one up, because I'm legitimately interested in reading it to acquaint myself better with it.  The question I immediately asked myself 'well, which one is the right one?'   When people assert religious dogma as fact, which bible are they asserting is the correct bible?  Or does it depend on the person? And if the word of god is truth, then why are there so many different versions of the bible?  If truth is truth, it surely shouldn't need a different interpretation.  Otherwise it's just opinion.Summary:

Summarize: Posted this on another thread but it is more relevant here   Last year, to celebrate the new year, my friends and I went to the beach, a friend has a house there... We have done this a couple of times, but this time was "special" because our friend turned 18... So his parents serve us a little bit of wine, they have a toast and then leave us to eat dinner... Another friend says "tonight will be just like The Hangover....lol jut kidding." Little did we know he was right... We go down to the beach, and get our drink on... Needless to say we all got super hammered. Our friend who turned 18 though was really sad, because he said he wanted to hook up with this girl and then another friend made out with her... So he was shitfaced, and making a fool of himself, so I tell him " hey lets go sit" and he got mad and grabbed a thick ass stick and threw it and it just so happenned to land on my face... Drunken me of course thought he did it all on purpose... So I let him be and storm off pissed as shit... Then, at 6 am we all decide we were going up to the house to get some rest... So we all up gather at the disco but wait... Our just recently turned 18 friend, lets call him Mike, was MIA, he was the one who was sad and angry because another friend hooked up with a girl he wanted to hook up with... Anyways, we all knew of what he was capable of doin drunk... Reckless shit... We searched for about an hour, nowhere to be found. We call his cell, someone picks up, we are all glad cause we think it is him, it is not, he had left his cell back at the house... We all seriously thought he had gone to take a swim drunk as shit in the ocean ( he did this last year, luckily we were all there and able to stop him from getting in ) and he mightt have drowned or something... About and hour later, a friend who had stayed back at the house because he had gotten sick said Mike's dad found him passed out on the balcony... His father did not make a big deal out of it... But we did not want his mother to find out because she would throw a fit... In the end, I was supposed to go back home with Mike because he lived real close to my house, ended going back with another friend to his place which was in no way close to mine, becuase his dad adviced me to becuae his mother was going to question me... Scariest moment of my life....Summary:

Summarize: It seems like a lot to pay for a glorified mylar bag. They talk about 45dB reduction, and Volts/Meter and whatnot, but they don't mention the most important thing...at what frequency?   There's nothing magical about Faraday cages. The higher the sheet-conductivity, the better the shielding. A couple layers of carefully-folded aluminum foil would give you better protection.   This type of conductive-film Faraday shielding only works against high-frequency EM waves. An EM pulse would have low frequency components (<100kHz) that would still penetrate the bag, because the bag simply doesn't have enough capacitance and is not well-grounded.   If you truly want to beat an EMP pulse, you need to shield it with mu-metal (look it up). I've used this in physics labs to quash ambient EM low enough to detect individual flux quanta.Summary:

Summarize: I am Sr. Graphic Designer for a fairly large company. We used to do 99% print design, 1% web. We've recently moved the web design in-house and our department has taken the brunt of it. We probably produce more web than print at this point. We do all the web graphics, email blasts (design and code) and web banners (static, animated and basic Flash). When my review comes up later this year, is it at all inappropriate to ask for a title change to Sr. Graphic and Web Designer and a slightly bigger salary to go along with it? I took web design classes on my own time and dollar so we could transfer this work in-house.Summary:
Summarize: I am Sr. Graphic Designer for a large enough company. We used to do 99% of printing design, 1% web. We recently moved the web design internally and our department took the bulk of it. We probably produce more web than printing at this stage. We make all web graphics, email explosions (design and code) and web banners (static, animated and basic Flash). When my exam arrives later this year, is it inappropriate to ask for a title change to Sr. Graphic and Web Designer and a slightly higher salary to go with it?

Summary: I am Mr. Graphic Designer for a quite large company. We used to do the 99% print design, 1% web design. We have recently moved the web design at home and our department has taken the worst part of it. We probably produce more web than print at this point. We do all the web graphics, email downloads (design and code) and web banners (static, animated and basic Flash). When my review arrives at the end of this year, it is absolutely inappropriate to ask for a change of title from Mr. Graphic and Web Designer and a slightly higher salary to go along with it? I took web design classes in my own time and dollar so that we could transfer this work at home.

Summarize: I love my girlfriend of 6 months.   But she's really giving me a hard time. Not because she is the problem, but I am.   Here are my concerns.     She values meeting new and interesting people. This scares the shit out of me I feel bad because I irrationally feel that she should be satisfied with me, as I am. She wants to meet a lot if people and I'm scared she'll find someone better.     She is very cool, and I am too but can also get emotional. She doesn't always shower me with attention and I guess this is ok but her love is cool and calm and I get scared because it isn't the explosive love I give. I often am the emotional one and the power level shifts to her which I can tell she finds unattractive.     She's foreign from Russia and she wants nothing more than to visit there again. She is very homesick and talks about her hometown like its heaven. And for some reason this makes me feel uneasy as I feel like she won't come back if she does visits this winter. I feel like shit because I could be in a shitty place with her and it would be the greatest. But she still has desire to leave to a place where I won't be.       I don't know what my problem is. Maybe I'm way too eccentric and immature. I feel bad because she is a huge part of my life and makes me satisfied but she on the other hand still has wants and desires to meet and go to places that aren't me and away from me. Although I know I am important to her I'm not satisfied or reassured.Summary:

Summarize: My boyfriend is a great person. Even though there is an age difference between us, we always get along and respect each other. Nothing is going horribly wrong, so I don't really understand my strong desire to leave him. It's really not about me wanting to see other people or experiment, I just suddenly don't want to be in this relationship. I feel horrible for feeling this way as I love him and I feel like I wasted his time. I can't bring myself to break up with him because I'm so attached to what we have, but at the same time things just do not feel right. All of a sudden I'm starting to find little things he does annoying and as a result I'm so irritable with him. I don't like being so mean for no good reason. He's really attached to me and always talks about how we'll go through anything together - so I hate how I'm suddenly not on the same page.   How do you know when it's time to really walk away? I don't want to do something I'll regret later, but this does not feel healthy.Summary:

Summarize: Last week, after a near-successful escape attempt from a busted tank, my rosy boa Hotwheels escaped successfully from one of the better safety tanks.    I cried, and was convinced that we wouldn't find him. There was no way. He was small enough to escape the maximum security prison tank, then he probably made it outside through a gap in the floor...    So, after carefully reading and judging, and getting opinions, I picked up a ball python, Beatrix. She's too big to escape the same way he had, and has mostly shown interest in sunning herself from her tree.    I thought about Hotwheels every night, and hoped he had made it to Florida to eat alligators, just like a big snake...    Then, this morning, my mom woke me up saying  MOTHER FUCKING HOTWHEELS WAS IN THE BATHROOM . I quickly picked up the little bastard, who quickly musked me in return. I deposited him into his old (broke) tank, and did some quick patches while my mom and I left to pick up some more snake equipment for him.    Now, I have two snakes...and love them both. However, when my boyfriend comes to live in the south this summer, I will be passing Hotwheels onto him. He's cool with this, and is actually really excited, but knows that I still love the shit out of that little orange guy.Summary:

Summarize: It's been a long-ish time since my last relationship, which was one that was the first-love type firey-sparky romance that ended in an unhealthy realization that the two of us were way too serious and only 22, and that we were way too young to get married.   Since that breakup, I have to admit that I've been a little scared that I'll never really fall in love again in that perfect "this feels right" way.  In particular, I have something that frequently happens.  Recently I've been seeing a girl that expressed a lot of interest in me.  She's kind and funny and pretty fun to hang out with, it's not super serious yet but I enjoy dating her (and the shitty thing to admit, it had been a year since I had had sex and really wanted to break that dry spell).   But for some reason I don't feel an intense burning "I'm in love fire" with her.  Maybe it's that she's not really totally my physical type, which is obviously shallow and really shitty to admit.  Maybe it's that there's something about her personality, she's a great and mature and fun person, which makes me fear that maybe I'm only attracted to unhealthy obsessive women who are prone to being overly mellowdramatic and "you're my world" into me.   Anyway, I'm at kind of a crossroads here, I've been seeing her for a little over a month now twice a week or so, and I'm not sure if I should break it off, or give it more time.  On one hand I like being with her and I really enjoy dating her, but I also don't feel like I could genuinely tell her "I love you" right now, and I'm not sure if that will change.  I'm also worried that I might be wasting her time.   A major fault of mine is that I haven't been in a lot of relationships that weren't super serious super quick.  All of my relationships have been very serious and emotionally intimate almost instantaneously.Summary:
Summarize: My friend (D) and I have known each other for around 8 years now and have been close friends for the last 3 years. I also work part time for the same events company she has recently started a full time job at.   D has been dating C [24/M] for the last 10 months or so. They met while he was living next door. His housemates at the time were meth junkies as was he and there were continual violent incidents there until they were kicked out and ended the rental lease. After that happened C moved into D's house next door and claimed he would find a new place to live soon. I didn't feel comfortable around C when i met him but then felt sorry for him as the meth junkie housemates had screwed him over for rent and disappeared. I tried being supportive to them both, and tried to remain neutral about the situation even though I thought C was bad news. (FYI D does not use meth and neither do I)   C claimed he would find a place to live soon but owed the rental agent money for breaking lease. Fast forward 8 months later and C is still living at D's house. That is none of my business but his behaviour that I've observed over this time really disturbs me and I'm concerned for D.   Example  A - D would be out working at an event (based in nightclub) and a male friend would speak to her, he perceives the male friend making an advance or being rude to her, so he punches them in the face. This has happened at least twice, in public and infront of others. He has been charged with assault in the past and one person who he hit reported it to the police.   Example B - D and I were rostered on to work at a particular venue where C had personal issues with some of the people who work there and didn't want her to go. D pulled out of her shift and said she had to be supportive to C's feelings which i thought was ridiculous.   Example C - C is always calling and if she doesn't pick up he abuses her over the phone. He doesn't come home for long periods of time which upsets her, he is probably out using meth.   As far as I know he isn't physically violent towards her but I have heard through another friend that she gets scared of him when he's coming down from a weekend on meth. That's why she pulled out of the important work shift we had. She hadn't told me that was the real reason and I don't want to bring it up incase he is cleaning up his act, as she hasn't mentioned anything to me and she appears happy. This is the first relationship I've seen her in since I've known her and I don't know if she's trying to make it work because she was single for so long. She definitely isn't herself and seems more withdrawn sometimes but again, unsure if that's my imagination.   She continues to tolerate and make excuses for his antisocial behaviour and it's beginning to put strain on our friendship and working relationship. But that may just be my perception? I also have a feeling he is telling her negative things about me as I think she's treating me differently.Summary:

He told me that I had a place to live soon but I owed the agent money to break the contract.
Summarize: Very broadly, it started with the revolution in Egypt that overthrew Mubarak and in Tunisia.  The revolutionary ideal spread (through what is known as diffusion in political science) to neighboring countries and eventually to Libya.  Libya, another authoritarian society, essentially said "why not us?"  More specifically, due to the success of the revolutions in Egypt, Tunisia, and other places in the Arab world, Libyans felt that this was their chance to overthrow their dictator.   To answer your question as to "why now?" I'll use a bit more social science.  Essentially, there is an inherent cost-benefit analysis in deciding to start a revolution.  The revolutionaries must feel that they have a better chance in succeeding in overthrowing the government than in failing.  Further, the government has a same cost-benefit analysis in deciding to repress the revolution, or to accept it as they did in Eastern Europe 1989.  In Libya, the cost-benefit analysis for the revolutionaries was skewed because of recent successful revolts in their neighboring countries.  So not only did they feel they could be successful, but they were spurred on by seeing it successfully done elsewhere.  Further, they believed that support from the West of their cause would legitimize it, deterring Qaddafi from using force.  Qaddafi and his government saw these as well and realized that they must preempt the revolution and respond with overwhelming violence (which is what we see, for example, in Bahrain).  As we also saw due to the necessity of NATO in defeating his forces, he maintained a strong security force to back him.  Qaddafi knew that he had no chance of maintaining power once the revolution picked up enough force.  Unfortunately for Libya, this quickly deteriorated past the point-of-no-return.Summary:
Indeed, Libya, another authoritarian society, essentially said "why not us?" More precisely, because of the success of revolutions in Egypt, Tunisia and other countries in the Arab world, Libyans felt that it was their chance to overthrow their dictator. To answer your question about "why now?" I will use a little more social force. Essentially, there is a cost-benefit analysis inherent in the decision to launch a revolution. Revolutionarys must have a better chance of overthrowing the government than of failing. Moreover, the government has a cost-benefit analysis even to decide to suppress the revolution, or to accept it as they did in Eastern Europe 1989.

In Libya saw the cost-benefit analysis for the revolutionaries was made through the successful upgrade in their neighboring countries.
Summarize: Simply by playing some normals with some low level friends or on other low elo accounts, I understand the obsession people have with grouping as a team, simply because I have it as well when playing with them.   In a higher level play (at least in my experience) people have a greater idea of how different objectives give you advantages, and mostly have a good understanding on when to push for them.   For example, as a jungler, if you have any idea of where the enemy jungler is (be it by wards or otherwise), you will either try to counter his gank, or go to the opposite side of the map in order to have a number advantage and get kills or objectives. Same with laners, they'll push and get damage on the turret/gain a CS advantage if they see the enemy laner somewhere else. Whether these "trades" are convenient determines the outcome of the game, but you can be sure that your teammates are actively trying to create advantages, and not staying passive while the enemy counterpart gets ahead.   However, in a lower level of play, not many people understand the need of constantly pushing for leads. This means that while you are getting 4 man ganked, your team may not retaliate in any kind, some times not even a minor thing like pushing and making the enemy miss a wave. This means that no matter how many enemies you draw to yourself, how much time you make the enemy jungler waste, it will never be worth it simply because they got a kill and your team got nothing.   Eventually you lose the trust in your team, and think that the only way for them to be useful is to force them to make plays, and since you can't easily tell them to make complicated strategies, you simply tell them to group so that they'll be around when you go for an objective.Summary:
Summarize: Firstly, thanks for being civil. I hardly ever debate with my libertarian friends anymore, because, well... they get heated about this stuff.   To answer your question- quite deep. I read the usual stuff, Ayn Rand's books, Robert Ringer, Harry Browne, even Robert Nozick and his ideas on the "Immaculate Conception" of the State. Follwed Ron Paul for a while (not a fan anymore). Penn and Teller were also hilariously good. Some others, I forgot.   It broke down for me when I went from college to "the real world". Libertarianism has some valid criticisms on socialism, a main one being that people are inherently selfish, and that that is not a bad thing. Some very few people are genuinely unselfish (or maybe they just value gratitude more than money, but let's not get metaphysical) but you cannot change people. All this is very true. But then I realized another reality... the vast majority of people, if given the choice, do not want responsibility, even for themselves. They prefer order, sadly too often of any kind, over freedom. (Note: This is not to excuse totalitarianism. This is to explain why a libertarian party / government will not succeed in creating a libertarian society.) People want to count on large pools of government money to minimize their exposure to risks. So just like communists misunderstood human nature, so do libertarians in my view.   Another point was when I realized that meritocracy leads to oligarchy. Maybe at some point talent allowed people to go to the best schools, get the best degrees, get the best jobs and get ahead. The people of the mind who work hard would be rewarded. But today those people can afford to buy tutors, private schools and all sorts of assistance to help their kids get ahead of poorer ones who may be far more talented. If you continue this for long enough, the idea of a meritocratic society of talent gets totally undermined. Which is why I support European-style heavy government spending on education and am happy to pay taxes on it.   It is also said that government is corrupt and inept. That is true, but only captures part of the reality. The last few years, and my work experience have shown me that people are corrupt and inept, not just government. Look at HSBC or Goldman Sachs (corrupt) or Comcast (inept). (NOTE: This is not to say that government size and structure does not matter. It does. It just means that government as an idea or as an entity is not fundamentally evil (or benevolent)).   Also, the antitrust thing. A completely free and unstructured market will destroy itself. If a company gets powerful enough to dominate a market, it will use its resources to push out and destroy better, more innovative companies. Say you run starbucks and someone opens a coffee shop that sells better coffee for lower prices. If I were starbucks, I'd open two stores right next to that one and offer combat pricing. Those two stores will make losses, but I can afford that since it will rid me of a competitor. Once that competitor is broke, I'll close one and restore normal prices. I'd do that because I'm selfish. I could not do that if that shop was as rich as I was. Effective monopolies destroy innovation and rob the consumer of choices.   I could go on about immigration, more market stuff, gun rights... but I hope you get the gist of my ideas.Summary:
Summarize: i hear what you're saying.  i would love to see the end of the state, if that meant i could do everything i wanted, because for the most part, i am a responsible person, and i don't have any great desire to take other people's stuff, or make it harder for someone else to make a living just because they don't look like me.  but the problem is there  are  people like that, and while i am not black or jewish, people who base their opinion of another person's worth on something so arbitrary could just as easily find some problem with me.  that's what society is all about, a set of agreements on what is acceptable and what is not.   so comparing the effects of racism by buyer vs. seller is a bit problematic- neither one is good or should be accepted, but one causes more harm than the other.  it has to do with sample size.  the nature of commerce means for any particular good, there will be more consumers than producers.  therefore, if an individual consumer makes irrational decisions, he limits his own choices, but the harm to the producer is minimal.  however, if a producer makes an irrational decision, he can cause a whole group of consumers some amount of hardship.  if the market has much competition, then that harm is limited, and more than likely will steer consumers away from that producer - as long as it is public knowledge that the producer has made that decision.  in the case of discrimination against minorities, it often is the case that it's not a public policy, therefore, people who are not part of that minority group may not even know, and continue to do business with that producer, limiting the negative effect it will have on the business.  even if it is public policy, people who are not part of the group may dislike the policy, but since it doesn't affect them personally, may not include it in the decision making process.  and then there is the case of a natural monopoly, i.e. if there is a good that is so unique, or so tied to location, that there can be only one producer, then effectively, the product is being denied to a group of people for no good reason.Summary:

Summarize: I've been struggling with depression since I was about 12 or so. I've never really been happy "in general" but that's not to say I can't ever get my ass out of bed. I made it to college, somehow, and after two years of alcoholism and drug abuse I had a full fledged mental breakdown. Paranoia that I can now acknowledge as irrational consumed my life, family and friends wanted me tortured and killed, I was going to be castrated, sometimes it was the infamous 'they' threatening to harm my family and friends instead. This continues to this day (I'm 25) but is relatively manageable with 1200mg Lithium and various antipsychotics(whichever don't happen to be giving me dystonic side effects at the moment).   Long story short, I'm curious if there's some undiagnosed schizoaffective aspect, if there is such a thing as mild schizophrenia, if bipolar is used as a blanket term, if anyone else is experiencing "manic episodes" that, instead of being highs, are based in paranoia. I lose my insurance in about two months and I don't know if I should seek a psychiatrist that doesn't specialize in the diagnosis that has been slapped on me or if these are issues that other people deal with.Summary:
Summarize: I've know a few people who this happened too. Their family disowned them and  completely  broke contact, one kid hadn't seen or herd form any relative for 7 years. I met most of them when I was in college and every signal one of them were fucked up. They were all horrible people that were well on their way to being sociopaths. Their empathy for others feelings where gone or was ignored, even purposely hurt. When they learned that nobody in their family truly loved them and were just broken and now permanently angry at the world. The worst were the ones who joined the military to ensure that they could never act on their "urges".Summary:

Summarize: I once went to the bar with a group of my girlfriends I don't often see. We were looking forward to an evening of drunken shenanigans and letting loose. We even got a little dolled up - my friend Kate wore her hot new cowboy boots and showed them off before we left.   We got to the bar and started buying the rounds, my tiny frame quickly reaching the tipsy point. After a few hours, I went to the restroom to evacuate some of the beer and shots I'd been downing. While I'm doing my thing, I see under the stall door Kate's sexy boots waltz in.   Now, this was not long after the  Larry Craig Scandal  thought it would be hilarious to give her a couple "toes taps" under the door. I slid it under the partition and started moving my foot around, even giving her a couple light taps on her cute little boots. No response. I did it a few more times and  nothing . Finally I banged on the stall wall and said, "Come on baby, give me a little sugar!"   Kate still didn't respond, so I finished my business and got out to wash my hands. As I did, I saw a glimpse of my neighbor through the stall door. And I realized that the bleach blonde hair I was seeing was NOT a match to my friend Kate. I had just propositioned a stranger in a dirty bar bathroom.   I booked it out of there and my friends and I left before I was arrested.Summary:
Summarize: I joined a campaign with several friends and the DM told me we could use anything in the core rulebook. I am an experienced player, about 8 years or so (if you include 3.5 and pathfinder), and the rest of the party is relatively new, so I waited to see what they made and chose accordingly. I ultimately chose to make a Dex Fighter since melee combat was at a minimum for the party. The DM was extremely frustrated with the high AC a battlemaster dex fighter can achieve and made it clear that he did not like the character by sending wave after wave of enemy specifically targeting him. A cult paid off a ship captain to let assassins on board an NPC ship to kill him, he was poisoned in a tournament, he was specifically targeted by a rakshasha (which the DM made clear would continue coming back to kill my specific character every so often until I went into the 9 hells and killed it there), etc. but all attempts on his life failed thanks to some lucky rolls. To make life easier for everyone, when one player could no longer play I decided my character would walk off into the sunset with the other character and I decided to roll up a new one.  I wanted to make a rogue initially, but the DM told me that the sneak attack was too high at our level (we're level 10) and the character would be overpowered. I threw out a few other options, all were turned down for some reason or another until he told me the party needed a designated healer. We already had a paladin who is quite good at healing and a druid who could cast healing spells, but seeing no other options, I agreed and made a cleric. I went with Light domain (trickery was off limits), since it has more damaging spells but retains the ability to heal and the DM was happy. The major issue now is that I absolutely hate this character. I have never enjoyed playing a cleric (no offense to clerics, it just isn't the class for me).  The DM is a good friend of mine, as are the people in the campaign and so I don't want to leave the group, but I can't keep playing this character. Unfortunately, he made my character essential to the central story line when he was introduced, so I can't just have him walk off into the sunset too. I've never had a situation like this and I'm unsure of what to do. Any help is appreciated.Summary:
Summarize: Honest to god, Mark Henry during that mid-2000s, red singlet, pre-Hall of Pain, Kool-Aid Man phase.   I remember being like 14 and channel surfing past Smackdown in time to see him in some random throwaway squash where he no-sold all of Chavo Guerrero's shit and World's Strongestly Slammed him to death. It might have been part of the Chavo/Hornswoggle feud. I didn't know anything about wrestling at this point, I just remember thinking, "wow, that dude with the dreads is badass." It was funny to me how clearly out of his depth Chavo was.Summary:

Summarize: This is [Roxie]( What breed do you think she is?   Roxie is 6. I rescued Roxie when she was ~1.5. It was really clear that she had been abused. I spent a lot of time working with her to show her how to be a dog again. Luckily for me, Rox is actually quite intelligent.   I took her to obedience school, one that supposedly specialised in dog aggression and they were.... well, pathetic. They had levels of classes and we blitzed every single 'test' to the next level which really just meant we were passed from trainer to trainer. They had dog aggression classes which I hated and wouldn't go to. (One involved me holding Roxie's attention while another person bought their dog aggressive dog up behind us in a sneaking manner. Disaster when the dog hears them, turns, and there's two dog aggressive dogs face to face. I was ignored when I raised this.) Roxie's obedience is exemplary. She loves to play with other dogs, and has more friends than I do.   Roxie has issues saying Hello. Instead of just casually greeting another dog with a 'Hi, what's up?' Roxie barks and carries on like you've threatened to remove bacon from the world. Once she can sniff the dog, she calms down and from that point on there is no problem. It's not excitement, it's definitely more 'aggression', but it's always in the lead up to meeting the dog. Once she meets them there is no fighting, snarling, growling, barking or anything. Off leash there is next to no issue. Maybe 3 seconds of her tensing and then she's fine.   I have worked with her extensively using a number of techniques.   We've tried walking away. I make her sit and focus on me. I've tried Cesar's method of a poke (this one actually worked but I would NOT recommend it to anyone else). I correct her with the leash, both ends. Adding a ball or toy into the mix is a disaster and makers her too excitable so we don't do that. Spray bottle. Treats. NILIF. I've spent years, a fair bit of $$, countless hours. That's all fine, I love my little pup. She HAS improved.   I was in a motorbike accident a few years ago and haven't been as active with her. I have now moved to a new area, in an attempt to get my life back, go to uni, am in a new house. We went to a dog park the other day which was huuuuuuuge. I took us into an area where no one else was but we could see other dogs. Roxie could play and fetch the ball, see a dog and be rewarded for focusing her attention back on me.   At parks I am extremely vigilant. An owner started heading in our general direction us so Roxie was recalled, and leashed. The other dog was off leash and headed toward us, circling us while Roxie barked at it. The owner apologised (she was so far away we had to yell) and I said it was fine. Her dog came into our space, and had to run pretty far away from it's owner. He also didn't go back when called.   I always put Roxie on her leash when I suspect anyone is coming anywhere near us. I trust her obedience and even her recall. In the past she has proven herself with this. I still feel like I was a bit in the wrong though and definitely didn't appreciate being approached by this other dog who was friendly but uncontrolled and making Roxie worse by circling us and not coming close enough for her to sniff (Note other dogs walked off lead where the owner was and Roxie didnt run to them and they didn't run to us).   The thing is, if Roxie was off leash, they would have played. But because she has leash aggression and we have never met this dog, I don't want to get into trouble by having a dog bolt at us and her react badly just this one time off leash. So I put her on the lead and then she definitely does react which results in the other owner removing their dog and Roxie doesn't get to meet anyone new.   Do you think it's ok for me to take her to a section of the park that is secluded, where she can go off lead and play by herself, if I am vigilant and leash her at even the slightest hint of a possibility of another dog coming our way? I also want her to see other dogs playing and running and know it's ok.Summary:
I did a little time with her to show her how to be a dog again. Fortunately for me, Rox is actually pretty smart. I took her to the school of obedience, a so-called dog assault specialist and they were... well, pathetic. They had class levels and we blitzed every 'test' to the next level that really meant that we were moved from the coach to the coach. They had dog assault classes that I hated and didn't want to go to. (One involved me holding Roxie's attention while another person bought their aggressive dog behind us in a sneaky way.

Summarize: Before I go on my discussion, I must say that I'm a huge Wondo fan. Great attitude, great work ethic and he appears to be an outstanding human being. I loved him when we had him (despite not playing much) and I love him to this day.   However, I've never felt Wondo was good enough USMNT. People say he's the Twellman of this cycle but I felt Twellman might have been better. I've always seen Wondo's a jack of all trades, master of none. As a striker, he's average in a lot of categories, namely technical ability, athleticism, aerial ability and hold up/linking play. This sounds bad but in reality, it's pretty good given many are only average at only a few of those skills listed but poor in others.   What Wondo does have more than any other striker in the MLS is crazy smart movement inside the 6 yd box that causes nightmares for defenders. In the MLS, that's been huge but I always felt he didn't have another gear to play internationally. It feels that Wondo always plays at 100%, which is awesome, it's just that his 100% isn't as high as others. I mean you could see in the 2013 Gold Cup : he started off crazy good against minnows, but as the tournament went on and the competition got stiffer, he became ineffective, eventually losing his starting spot in the last two games. I mean, look at his international scoring record, beyond the Mexico goal (which was classic Wondo "right person right place" off a missed header), it's not all that impressive.   I don't think Wondo has had a hardtime winning over casual USMNT, I think he's had a hard time winning over even the hardcore USMNT beyond being a fan favorite. What did we all say when he made the 23? "This guy is a pure poacher and it makes sense to have him at the end of a game". That point blank miss didn't help his cause but he shouldn't be remember only for it. However, I do think the criticism of Wondo at an international level is fair as he hasn't had the same impact as he has in the MLS. I mean think about, Eddie Johnson, the dickish human being that he may be, is far better/consistent at the international level than Wondo despite being a fraction as effective at the MLS level.Summary:
Summarize: Hello fellow summoners!   (I’d like to excuse myself for my English in advance if needed.)   I’d like to ask you for some of your time to read these founding’s I have about the current 3v3 ranked plays.   More in particular the matchmaking people encounter in ranked games.   Some people might disagree and won’t care about 3’s which is your right but others might enjoy it as much as I do. And love a GG.   As you can see last night my friends and I encountered a ‘pro player’ (no offence intended with ‘ ) from NiP in ranked 3v3. (diamond I) at least that was his rank in 5’s (checked on lolnexus)   we ourselves are silver IV x1 and Gold V x2 in 5’s. we are Silver I in 3’s.   This is what I think is wrong in 3v3 and  one of  the reasons people (mostly casual players) are not  attracted to the ranked 3v3:   You are matched up against players of all skill level (tiers/divisions).   It only counts your current MMR in 3’s (I think, seeing that we face a lot of diamond players)   in some kind of way it should matter what your 5v5 MMR is.   ‘casual’ players get crushed silver VS ‘diamond’.   and ‘casual’ players are no match for ‘diamond’ players. you get my point.   You should face (like RIOT intended) a team around your skill level.   then we can talk about a GoodGame.   of course we ourselves enjoy playing VS players who are far behind our skill level.   who doesn’t like a free win?   but we should try and make it enjoyable for everybody/most people.Summary:

Summarize: Hi /r/studyAbroad!   I'm currently submitting papers to my host university on my study abroad this upcoming Fall quarter. (Not semester system :p) I do need to however, decide on which one of the two universities to submit for. Currently I am applying to both, but I am told that I need to make a firm decision on a first choice for uni paperwork. I also need to make the choice eventually.   The University of Bristol has a good ranking and reputation, but it uses a semester system that extends past Christmas break, and I'm hoping to be back at my host university (UCSD) for winter quarter by then. In order for things to work out still, I will need to arrange special assessment/final examinations for my classes that take place before the Christmas break. The university has said however, that they are giving no guarantee for this, especially for science and engineering classes.   Outside of the biology classes that I would like to take, there are also few classes that I can take that will count towards my major + are offered for only 1 semester/autumn semester. i.e I might end up wasting time taking classes that do not count towards my major. Bristol's classes also seem harder to get a good grade on heh.   The one thing that still makes me really want to go there is that my good friend goes to the Uni of Bristol! The University of Reading goes by a trimester system which matches my school's quarter system. There are also a plethora of classes that would count towards my major, one about the history of alcohol that doesn't count but sounds interesting too! I would have little to worry about class wise, but Reading's rankings and reputation seem lower and my friend doesn't go there! Having to train over to Bristol to meet a few times seems a lot less fun :s   What would you do /r/studyAbroad? Any insights into this issue? Thank you all so much :3Summary:

Summarize: Throwaway, because I have too many Redditor friends.   Last night, the two of us were working on the programs for the wedding. On the back, we're going to have a page in memory of family members that have passed and won't be there for the big day. Now, I knew of only one person from my family's side we needed to put on there, but my SO suggested that we put my great-grandfather on there as well, since my great-grandmother is coming to the wedding. So I got on the phone to double-check names, and make sure I'm not forgetting anyone.   During the conversation, my parents were giving me the names of a few other people that had passed. At one point, SO interrupts, interjecting that I should tell them that we probably won't be able to put all those names on the program. I look at her, nod and keep talking. I'm guessing she wanted me to tell them right that instant, because not 30 seconds later, she interrupts again with "interruptedphone, you need to tell them..." I held up a finger and nodded, since I was still in the middle of listening and writing names. That happened two more times.   When I wrote the last name down, she interjected again. "interruptedphone, wait..." I broke away from the conversation at this point to ask "Do you have another question they (my parents) need to answer?"   "No, but..."   "Okay, I already heard what you're about to say." And I went back to the conversation with my folks. She left in a huff, mouthing that I'm an asshole. After I finished talking with my parents, I left them know that the names might not all appear in the programs and we said our goodbyes. After we finished, SO comes back into the room and says that she's willing to apologize for interrupting me, but I have to apologize for being "rude" to her. In her words, rather than just say that I'd heard her, I should've broken off the conversation with my parents for a minute to explain to her that I'd heard her and was going to tell them the information after writing the names down.   At the time, I refused. In my mind, interrupting someone on the phone several times when they've acknowledged the fact they've heard what you said is far more rude than being short with that person. So here's my question: should I apologize, even though all I've done is bruise her ego a bit? I was short, yes, but in the context of a two person conversation with a party on the phone, I figured I was more than nicer than I could've been. I'm not a fan of apologizing just to assuage a bruised ego, mostly because that leads down a road of apologizing for everything and anything, even when you've done nothing at all. But if the general consensus is that I really am being an ass, I'll take it as word that I need to change.Summary:

Summarize: This might be nit-picking, but...how can you put months of your life into a game that has been out for 3 weeks? Did I miss something here?   The reason why I thought they introduced the new movement mechanics into the game was to quell the masses that continued to shout "COD is the same game every time. It's just copy paste with a few new guns."   I also thought the exo/movement was added as a way to increase the skill gap, so lesser skilled/experienced players couldn't get free kills, and the more talented players had a way to shine. I am not saying that you are lesser skilled/inexperienced, so no offense intended and I am not trying to patronize you.   No one is making anyone learn anything. No one held a gun to your head and told you to purchase the game, and to learn the new stuff. If you want to play BO2, then go play it! It's a GREAT game, and is standing the test of time. If you're looking for something fresh and different, then learn what this game has to offer. Every COD game doesn't have to follow the same formula...play what's fun for you! If this direction isn't something that you enjoy, then don't try to force yourself to enjoy it.   I would say that most of the experience we've had in COD has not been with all of this verticality, so of course it's going to be challenging to learn. I tend to think that anything that is worth doing shouldn't be easy.   Also, don't compare previous COD KD's to this game. You're not comparing apples to apples because of how everything has changed. No other COD game has been like this one, so to say "I was a X KD Ghosts/BO2 player, but in this game I'm barely pulling 1 KD" is not a fair assessment. I also don't understand the whole "live and die by the KD" mentality, but I guess that's a topic for another discussion.   To answer your last question, "Why learning to use the exos matters." The reason why I am learning to use them is because I like the pace and additional skill the exo brings to the game. It's not the same old stuff, as it adds new layers of mechanics to a system that felt stale to me (just my opinion).   SH has some work to do, especially with the score streaks, but considering the game has only been out for 3 weeks, I'm not worried. If you played Ghosts, you'd remember that the Ghosts we have today is much different than the Ghosts we had at release. (two IMS's anyone?)Summary:

Summarize: My first time was a journey.   It was freshman year in highschool, and I was with my Junior friends. We had to walk about an hour from our highschool to our local highschool dealer who was a super senior. After getting it, we went to Wendy's to eat before we even smoked. Bad idea and waste of money. We sat in Wendy's for about an hour realizing we had nothing to smoke with and no lighter. So, I call up 2 friends, one of which has a car, and one of which has a pipe. We went to the pipe-friend after getting in the car with car-friend. Smoked a couple bowls my first time, and reached a perfect [10] in the car. We listened to Domo Genesis, and I was sucked into the speakers listening to the beat.Soon after I couldn't stop laughing, and went to the park.   At the park, I was dared to go on the swings, and I felt majestic. I felt like an airplane over-looking the beautiful Portland, Oregon. Then, I had the urge to jump, so I did. I felt like I was dive bombing, and felt like a bad ass. Then, I landed and fell, leaving me with a shit ton of bruises. Soon later we went to a friends house and slept for many hours.Summary:
Summarize: My SO's cat died late last year. He was very old and it was just his time, but he was there for her throughout troubled high school years and was pretty much her baby and spent more time with her than the other cats in the house. When he passed she was depressed because she didn't have her baby anymore.   So she got a new kitten. For reasons I can't really go into but were against what she would have done on her own she had to get a specific breed of cat that came out at $700.   The kitten arrived and he was fairly kitten-ish. He was a little afraid to be cuddled and wanted to run around a lot but after a few months he mellowed out, accepted the other cats to an extent, and wants to be petted and sleep in the bed.   I'm not exactly a cat person, but I'll pet and be nice to the kitten but he seems to like me too damn much. I have scratches everywhere from him trying to rub my face with his. He likes to sleep on my chest as opposed to my lap so he'll arrive purring and affectionate like a sweetie-pie, and completely take over both of my arms while I'm trying to use a computer, read a book, do anything with my hands, ect. He bugs me EVERY morning and when I put him down he has jumped and clung to my butt crying because I stopped letting him sleep in my arms. Lately I've been waking up with him sleeping on my chest or tucked under the blankets. He loves rubbing my face and licking my mouth and ears. And I am especially terrified if I need to fap because sometimes I have no idea where he is and since I'm obviously doing something its a cue for him to jump between my legs with claws out to demand petting.   The problem is that I'm totally the wrong person he's supposed to do this to. He tolerates and sometimes is affectionate to my Girlfriend, who feeds him and cleans up his poop, but for the most part does not want to stay on her lap or play with her or be petted by her. Particularly if I'm in the room. To get him to like her more and to make him leave me the hell alone, when I'm trying to draw, paint, read, or use the computer, I sometimes take him over to my girlfriend so he can be held by her. Without fail he wiggles away from her and comes directly to me. At some point he made a flying leap out of her arms while he was being petted and jumped on me. He does this as if he's desperate so I have had my nipple pierced by kitten claws while he's trying to purr and cuddle as a result. He doesn't like me giving him to her and has bit her (kitten play bites not real ones. I know what his real bites are like because he tried to eat cards that I was holding.) so that he can wiggle away. Overall he seems to either tolerate her or avoid her. If she picks him up, he'll wiggle away. If i pick him up he melts and looks like he's happily drunk. He doesn't snuggle her or try to rub her face, or sleep on her and she really wants him to, while I just want him to leave me alone once and a while.   She basically spent $700 to get me a cat when it's supposed to be her cat.Summary:

Summarize: Recruiters are terrible to deal with.  The one's I've dealt with anyway.  Setting aside the harrassment issues (not sexual, just general haranging) they've lied to me so much to convince me to attend an interview.   The last one told me about an opportunity for Magento Developer, which sounded good so I decided to go, when I got to the interview, they said, "So you know what job you're interviewing for?" and jokingly I said "No, I just saw your ad in the window and thought I'd pop in",   Fortunately, this worked out in my favour as they missed the joke and said "ok, well it's a Head of Magento Team, where you'll be managing the team, all the projects, working with the sales team to deliver quotes and coming up with ideas for new and improvements for Magento modules".   As much as I'd love to do that now, at the time I had no prior experience of leadership or project management and at the time I still wanted to stick to day-to-day development work.  The recruiter had completely altered the job description to make it fit the skills on my CV (resume).   I told the interviewer that I wasn't here for the position, but sounded interesting so I'd rather carry on the interview.  I even got the callback but at the time I decided that I'd carry on day-to-day development.Summary:

Summarize: Well I was making a stupid self-deprecating joke but I see the circlejerk is in full swing in this thread.   I'm a reductionist and believe that men and women have inherently different interests when it comes to biological imperatives. Thus, I don't believe that it's possible for men (or women, for that matter) to be innately aware of the opposite sex' viewpoint. That said, I appreciate it is possible to learn, but I certainly don't expect it to be easy. If a man learns the thing that OP suggests, isn't that a good thing? My personal belief is that it's a massive ask for them to inherently understand it, so I'd rather congratulate those who do learn it and take appreciation in the knowledge that perhaps they'll share their wisdom.Summary:

Summarize: Hello, I am about to purchase my first airsoft gun (A G&G CM 16 Raider L DST) but this gun seems to be very popular and is sold out on almost every website I have seen. I have however seen this gun in other websites in stock in tan. Because I am under the age of 18 I cannot get a UKARA License, therefore I have to have my gun painted in two-tone. This would be fine with a black gun, but tan and bright orange/green/blue? That sounds weird to me so basically would It be against the UKARA Laws to paint the tan section of the gun black?Summary:
Summarize: Define a "shitty thing." I assure you, your definition of that concept and my definition of that concept are going to be vastly different. You cannot base an argument on a subjective categorical generalization. For example: I think it's shitty to smile at me when I am in a bad mood. Do you now also believe this? Am I expected to believe all people feel the way I do about this?   Just because you believe the action is reprehensible does not make the action reprehensible. That is the basis of what we call "taking offense." The action of rape may be said to carry an ethical and moral negative, but does talking about it also contain an ethical and moral negative? Making jokes surrounding rape can hardly be considered of the same offense as rape, in much the same regards making jokes about stealing cannot be equated to actually stealing. Do not confuse talking about rape with "thinking about committing rape" those are entirely different statements.   What we are left with is a personal, maybe even societal reprehension, which equates to what we call moral relativism. Which would mean you agree that morals are subjective and based upon the society and culture. Moral Relativism also means that OTHER societies and cultures are also, therefore, correct in their pursuit of morals, e.g. Sharia Law. You can't have your cake and eat it too here. However, I digress I didn't come to debate the ethical position surrounding rape, or moral relativism. I refuted the basis that rape jokes are wrong because they are an "emotionally negative issue." Rape jokes can still be wrong, however basing this conclusion on emotional response is not a valid argument.Summary:

Summarize: I'm a high school senior ready to start the next phase of my life! However I am a little stuck in the decision-making right now when it seems that everyone else has things all figured out. Basically, I have two options. I've been accepted to the University of Cincinnati in Ohio and have confirmed my admission, so I could realistically go there in the fall. It would cost me about $15,000 a year, so $60,000 for 4 years not including interest on the loans that I would definitely have to take out. My other option is to attend a community college closer to home for this year and then attempt to transfer not to UC but to a higher ranked university where I would get free tuition because of my family's low income. A couple options would be Stanford University in California and University of Pennsylvania. I have above average grades and test scores so I like to believe that I would be accepted. I was not very on top of things this past year and I didn't apply to these places by the deadline. If I chose the latter option, I would be living at home this year instead of moving onto a campus, which would allow me to be home with my younger sister who is struggling with an eating disorder. My parents also offered to buy me a car if I chose the latter option.Summary:

Summarize: I am a 20yr-old/m college student at a small university.  I have known this girl (20/f) for more than a year now.  We met at orientation and hit it off really well.  We would hang out all the time, and we became very close.  She started dating someone first semester and they broke up just after Christmas.  I was there when they broke up and we talked about it and I helped her through it.  When she was in the relationship, we didn't talk much (for obvious reasons), so it was really nice to reconnect.  Then, when things had gotten so much better, I worked up the courage to ask her out, but she was dating some other  guy (21/m).  That relationship lasted from February to about June of this year.  I was the first person that she called, because she was worried about the health of the relationship, and I gave my advice about what he was doing/feeling/whatever.  Two days later, he dumped her.  I was there for that and cheered her up.  So we talked every day (she lives three states away) on the phone, and the first week in July, I finally just told her how I feel about her.  She said that she knew that I felt that way about her, but was afraid to be in a relationship with me because if it failed, she knew she would lose a really good friend.  Here's the other thing: we're two peas in a pod.  We share a ton in common and it's an incredible partnership.Summary:

Summarize: So, I'll try to keep this short.   I met this girl online (read: tinder) and everything was awesome. Chatted a lot, went out two days in a row then she went away for a week to visit family.   Queue a week of chatting sporadically and I offered to pick her up from the airport. Pick her up, and take her home and on the way she asks me if I want to stay (wasn't expecting that).   So I stay and yeah... Anyway. Chatting away and there was some questions which we both answered one of which was 'has anyone ever asked you to marry them' so I answered truthfully that I had been engaged (long story) and she went funny on me.   Told me that chatting had to slow down and that we could only talk every so often. I asked her if she wanted to meet up and she said maybe then said no at the last minute. Fair enough. No biggie.   She then says that maybe we should stop talking so we do. I'm a bit confused at this point, we're both adults, the past is the past.   So I get a snapchat from her the other day and I reply. We start chatting again and I mentioned that we had plans for next Friday. She seems to be completely up for still seeing me so now I'm even more perplexed!   WTH is going on here. I like her quite a bit. She has very similar humour to me and everything is easy if that makes sense.Summary:

Summarize: 15 years ago, Jan 1999, CBA was about $23 bucks, now $77 + about $35 of dividends (plus fanking credit). The S&P 200 was 2798 and is now 5443 (sorry can't get that much of a timeframe worth of divs but it wouldn't be nowhere near CBA's). Which one performed better?   What's the risk in holding Australia's largest bank? If the damned thing goes down the gurgler we've got much bigger problems than losing 10K on the sharemarket don't we?   I'd be more concerned if op only has a residential property worth about 500K that's 200K in debt. That's more risk than 10K in CBA...   I understand "portfolio theory" would say there's more risk in holding one stock vs the whole market, and I'd be an idiot to argue against it. The argument is, however, about 10K which is not a lot of money. Might as well make that work as hard as possible whilst avoiding things like speculative investments. I could just have easily said put 10K in Fortescue because they'll do great, I am however unsure how well it's going to be in 15 years' time (could be the next Rio, but it could also be a flop).Summary:

She won't get frustrated at you when she has trouble getting it.   You won't get frustrated at her when she has trouble getting it.   You can ride some real slopes while she's in her lesson instead of wasting a day in the bunny hill.   The instructor wins too.Summary:
Summarize: So this might be common knowledge but as a plat terran player who somewhat pays attention to reddit, big tournaments etc etc this blew me away.  The other night my brother told me that command centers give you 11 supply.  I didn't believe him because I've been playing the game for 6+ months and don't remember this ever working this way (this had to throw off some of my builds right?).  So I went into a custom game to test it  Sure enough it added 11 supply, I built several more to make sure I wasn't seeing things (rare 7 OC build, you've probably never heard of it) and each time it increased my supply by 11.  I guess I've been too focused on other things in the game to notice that command centers add supply but it's a nice little tidbit to know and can be used to your advantage.Summary:
Summarize: This is actually for my husband, who got his degree in Elementary Education in 2008. He's been looking for a full time teaching position since then. His Ohio license was K-3 with reading specialty, and he's since gotten 4-5 added (and the new Reading endorsement). We happen to live in an area oversaturated with teachers, so we knew it would be tough, but not this tough.   He's subbed, long-term subbed, and is currently teaching Title 1 (which is part-time/hourly). After years of bouncing around between schools, he decided to focus on one district to "get in" with the administration. He long term subbed for a year, and this is his second year in Title 1 there. (He's applied for full time in other districts though.) They love him there, but apparently not enough to hire him full time.   He's applied to every posting, and gotten ONE interview since 2008. He was top of his class has had stellar letters of recommendation everywhere he's worked. The problems I see is that he doesn't "know" anyone and he's not very aggressive or outgoing. He is much more comfortable in a classroom of kids than a room full of teachers and administrators. He's a 42 year old married man with kids (I don't know if that is helpful for him or not). I feel like he's missing something about the teaching "culture"... and I certainly don't understand it. He's been told that the Title 1 teachers are like the "interns" and they often hire from there, but I don't trust them to be looking out for his best interests either. (If he's good at Title 1, why would they want to have to pay him more?)   So here we are 6 years later, and I'm wondering when we will have to give up on his dream. I have a decent job, but it's not enough to support a family of 5 for this long. We're sinking pretty fast. Every year we're optimistic that this will be the year it will turn around, and then we hit September. He likes Title 1, he loves teaching and he's good at it, but financially it's just not going to work. Even a "meager" starting teaching salary of $20K would be more than double what he makes now, plus actual benefits.   Any thoughts or advice would be helpful. We're so entrenched I wonder if there's something he's missing.Summary:
He has no full-time work. He is K-3 with a reading specialty, and he has obtained since 4-5 (and the new Reading endorsement). He manages to live in an oversaturated region with teachers, so we knew it would be hard, but not so difficult. He is under-educated, under-educated in the long term, and he currently teaches Title 1 (which is part-time/hour). After years of rebounding between schools, he decided to focus on a district to "shuffle" with the administration. He has long been under-educated for a year, and this is his second year in Title 1 (it is requested for full-time in other districts however.) They love him there, but apparently not enough to give him a full-time job. He asked for all the positions, and he was not helpful to his students.
He is K-3 with reading specialty, and he has been getting 4-5 added (and the new reading confirmation). We pass to live oversaturated in an area with teachers, so we knew it would be tough, but not so hard. He is subbed, long-term subbed, and currently teaches Title 1 (this is part-time/hours). After years of bouncing around between schools, he decided to focus on a district to be in administration. He is long-term subbed for a year, and this is his second year in Title 1 there.

Summarize: No, I totally understand what happened. You're not the only person this has happened to.   The issue is that the address you originally adhered to the original package included a return address that you designated. I'll imagine that this address was correct, and you seemed to confirm this.   This package is shipped to an outsourced vendor, probably outside of your country. For America, all packages are shipped to Laredo, Texas to then be carried over the border. Once the package is received, the error is confirmed, and your Xbox is essentially thrown in a pile of broken Xboxes.   A person at a computer checks a box, and a new-to-you (refurbished xbox) is mailed to you. This may or may not come from the same facility, nonetheless the same country, as your Xbox. They do not use the same label. They do not use the same box. A new label is printed, adhered to a box with another xbox in it, and mailed to you.   When that label was printed, they used your most up to date information with Microsoft/Xbox. You are required, as per the terms of your billing contract and/or your warranty to update that information as necessary. This is the case with all warranties or contracts you may hold with anybody. You are required, by law, to keep updated records with the manufacturer.   This is where the error occurred. Microsoft has nearly no leverage. They have nearly no ability to contact whoever received your package and request they send it back. They can contact your carrier, which in this case was UPS, and ask them to investigate. You, as a third party, do not have the ability to initiate this process (I think; worth a shot anyways, but it sounds like UPS already told you to contact MSFT).   Your resolution is pretty straight-forward, and it's really unfortunate that you received such poor customer service that they weren't able to articulate this when you called them in the first place. This is one of the many reasons why MSFT, and many other US companies, are slowly bringing their call center personnel back on shore-- to provide substantially better customer service. I don't know about you, but the Fillipino reps we get to talk to for US-based calls are horrible!   Anyways... here is what you need to do. You need to get off your ass and go pick up your package, or negotiate with a real human being at your college to forward it. When you move, you have an obligation to setup mail forwarding. I'll imagine this is a service available in the UK, for it is a service available in America. All packages with your name delivered/routed to your old address will automatically be rerouted to your new address. This is your obligation. You should offer to pay postage to have it rerouted to you, because either your University or UPS will have to absorb this cause, although the error was neither of their fault. Since technically they are not even legally allowed to do this for you, since who knows you are actually the person you say you are and aren't a con artist trying to steal an Xbox, don't have high expectations.   You will need to either pick it up in person, with photo ID, or ask the school to return the package to the original sender. This will take another 2-3 weeks for MSFT to actually receive the package. Since you're spoken to the call center reps, there are notes all over this service request, and I would imagine they would automatically ship the package to the correct address. To ensure this, you should make sure your information is updated with MSFT. You can do this on their website, xboxlive.com, or via the phone.   edit:Summary:
Summarize: No, I totally understand what happened. You're not the only person to whom it happened. The question is that the address you originally respected the original package included a return address that you designated. I imagine that this address was correct, and you seem to confirm it. This package is shipped to an outsourced supplier, probably outside your country. For America, all packages are shipped to Laredo, Texas to be transported to the border. Once the package is received, the error is confirmed, and your Xbox is essentially thrown into a broken Xbox pile. A person to a computer checks a box, and a new one to you (renovated xbox) is sent to you. This may or may not come from the same installation, but the same country, as your Xbox. They don't use the same label as the reasons you don't use the same box.

Summarize: It was a summer in the year 2005, small beach town on the coasdt of Southern California. I, at the time, was 19, hanging out with a couple buddies when we heard of a Volcom factory party in Costa Mesa. So we head over there.   I had 3 beers before we got to the door, so I was feeling pretty buzzed (i'm a lightweight). I show the doorman my ID and he gives me a 21+ wristband. And all of my underage friends as well. So we go in and they have a full OPEN bar and in random buckets, redstripe beer and wine. So I grab some more beer and start drinking. Before I know it, I was hitting on random young ladies with my new found self confidence. One girl came up and we started talking but I thought she was into me so I grabbed her and kissed her, but as soon as I realized she wasn't kissing me back I let go and all my friends laughed and she stormed away.   I wandered around asking more girls if they want to make out but none obliged, so I found myself upstairs with a bottle of cheap wine and I drank about half of it. I then meandered downstairs and by this time I was so drunk I could barely walk. I saw my friend and I said, "watch this" and kicked the wall and a huge picture fell off it. We were then escorted out, and by this time we were all drunk and it was around 2am. So stupidly my friend drove drunk. I blacked out for about 30 mins until I got woken up by my friend yelling at me to "GET THE FUCK UP AND OUT OF THE CAR!!!!!!!!!!!!" So naturally, I did. We were at a church. He told me to go kick the church van. So we both, drunk, started kicking this random church van. I remember I kicked it so hard I fell down. Then I ran over and kicked a sign. Then got back in his car and drove off.Summary:

Summarize: Ahh the age old group bathroom excursion question. I will try to explain to the best of my womanly abilities this strange female habit. I do believe there are two reasons why women travel to the bathroom in groups: firstly, and most prevalently, it happens because it has always happened. Pretty disappointing right? I know it's totally dumb but it's just one of those social pressures that women have to learn and then adhere to in order to get along with other women. For men a similarity might be the internal bathroom etiquette of not talking and spacing in urinals. At some point you had to learn this behavior, because it is expected of you to adhere to it. I could go into my theories for why I think the lady habit began in the first place but this comment is already long enough. Now the second reason, is why I personally adhere to this pack bathroom nonsense. Reason #2: there is safety in numbers. Rape, molestation, harassment are always an issue for women. Everyday you have to be aware that your safety from the opposite sex is not guaranteed and therefore must protect yourself. And the best deterrent from getting caught alone in one of those scary rape trap bathrooms out there is having 3 other friends that are down to kill a muthafucka for you. This is also why I have always only kept athletic female friends, but that's just a personal preference.Summary:
Summarize: I believe "Our" purpose as a species is to seek truth. Connect the dots and understand why what is, is. Is our universe one of many? is it a cell living within something far bigger than us? (very cool idea a friend of mine was talking about) in our life times, we may never know these answers, but we can lay down the ground works. As a collective, as a species I believe Our purpose is finding answers. We've become an Intellectual species, with natural curiosities, every child I've met has always asked "why?"   As an individual I believe our purpose is one of support for one another, helping everyone achieve their best. In a sense, helping everyone be happy. I've met many individuals with PTSD, Bi-polar, and other various mental disorders, many I've met all had dreams, things they wanted to pursue in order to be happy in life, but walked away from because of how they felt, because the social stigma of saying "I'm not ok." I believe if the individual can be happy in life, they can contribute in a small or big way to helping us all understand the questions around us.Summary:

Summarize: On Thursday, I was accepted into college so I decided to have a party like anyone would. I got a few friends over and so the mayhem began.   Smashed a bottle of Jack in the space of an hour, topped off a Bacardi and coke, 80/20 and dropped about halfway through whatever I drank next. Needless to say, I was out until 12:00pm the next day.   I waddled over to the kitchen to get some dry biscuits in an attempt to stop myself from emitting viscus death all over the house and just as I did a perfect 120 pivot to face the fridge only to see the hand-drawn notice tacked to it with a magnet that was once a squirrel but now only his body and one arm.   "Hairdressers at 1:30 FRIDAY"   I could have collapsed, I could have convulsed, I could have done both and left myself strewn on the cold floor for my roommate to discover my frozen corpse but no.   I couldn't help but feel that not attending this appointment would be a grave mistake, after all, college means new people and this hair was three months behind a Vietnam vet, 3 months in a spider-hole so, it must be done. A challenge that I have accepted, as god as my witness, I will get this hair cut.   And so, with a quick freshen up and some new clothes, I speed off out the door. 12:50.   Drive into afternoon traffic, barely holding sick down. 1:12.   Pull up on the parking lot, a block away from the hair dressers. 1:27.   Hoist myself through the doors, finally here. Vomit at the ready. 1:32   and so, the empty hairdressers greeted me, this would be an in and out job, nothing more, nothing less. Quick and clean.   The woman at the reception desk comes up to lead me to a chair after a few minutes of waiting and just as I open my mouth to say 'Thanks'. A storm of regret, Jack, Bacardi, Coke and dry biscuits topples out like Niagara falls, sliding down her dress, the majority of it on the floor and her shoes and then I slump back into a stationary position only for her to do some sort of Patrick Stewart quadruple take. I'm freaking out, she's freaking out, the other hairdresser is in a limbo of anger and laughter and I just lift my hands up in defense and walk at a fairly brisk pace backwards while saying sorry all the while.   Still haven't got my hair cut.Summary:
I had a few friends and started. I took a bottle of Jack in the space of an hour, I pulled out a Bacardi and coke, 80/20 and I fell halfway through what I drank. Needless to say, I had gone out until 12pm the next day. I got into the kitchen to make dry biscuits trying to stop me from emitting viscous death all over the house and just like I did a perfect 120 pivot to face the fridge only to see the hand-drawn opinion that was piled on it with a magnet that was once a squirrel but now only his body and an arm.
I have a few friends over and so began the chaos. I have a bottle of Jack in the time of an hour, crowned by a Bacardi and coke, 80/20 and fell about halfway through what I drank next. Needless to say, I was until 12:00 the next day. I wobbled across the kitchen to find some dry cookies in an attempt to stop me from sending out Visku's death across the whole house and just like I did a perfect 120 pivot to see the fridge just to face, I would have done both and left on the cold ground for my room dweller, but now only to discover his body and an arm. "Haardresser at 1:30 FRIDAY" I couldn't have collapsed at this date, I might have had a serious mistake, after all months a few people in Vietnam mean to hold a new hell.
On Thursday, I was accepted into college, so I decided to have a party like anyone else would. I have some more friends and so the chaos began.

Summarize: Wish i had answered this one earlier - my family of 5 was put up in a London hotel along with a few hundred other passengers of a Qantas A380 flight that had to stop unexpectedly. About 400 people were all sent to this one hotel in the middle of the night. Their was only one man on the desk, and he could not speak English. It took about two hours to actually get into a room. When we got there, we discovered there was not enough beds - it was me and my parents, with only one double bed, however we were assured that a camp bed would be brought up shortly. One hour later, no extra bed. So we called reception, and they said the bed was on its way. Some sheets and a doona appeared, still no bed. In the end, the hotel told me that basically i was expected to sleep on the floor. A five star hotel, and i was told to sleep on the floor. In the end i got about 2 awkward hours of sleep in the same bed as my parents before getting up and going back to the airport.Summary:

Summarize: Within the halls of Konstatinyye a deal was struck. 1000 slaves were to be given to Ragusa in exchange for an increase in tribute. To be exact, 125k ducats for 1000 slaves.   Yet, these slaves were happy upon the ships bound for Ragusa. Their irons were struck and clothes replaced (if worn). A joyous celebration was had. The cry of  Libertas, Libertas  filled the air. Along the harbor people gathered as the ships left. Slaves looked onward, the possibility of a future ahead within their grasp. Freedom for slaves was always a possibility within Islam, but the prospect of a recurring exchange was pleasant.     Duke Dzoric of Ragusa frowned at the Mamluk Delegation. Frustration was to be expected, after all Ragusa was a rival of Venice; and by extension the Mamluks. He had hoped their mutual desire for Cyprus would force the issue toward Ragusan benefit, Cyprus was always an eye for Egypt, for her isles offered naval bases and striking power toward Anatolia; now the Turkish demense.   There were many in Ragusa who questioned their status toward the Ottomans. They desired freedom, which is only natural. However the Sultan had always been generous toward the fledgling republic. Besides annual tribute, not much was desired. Ragusa could enter into foreign agreements and had the defensive power of the Sublime Porte if attacked. She could sail along the banner of the Ottomans and not fear barbary piracy.   Now that he thought of it, they would have been a better group to ask. Their slaves would mostly have been Italian, and fit right at home in Ragusa.   "You shall not have our slaves", spoke the Mamluk delegation. "You presume to land here, not only bearing the Ottoman standard, but also seeking to harm the Amir of the Venetian Isles, our ally of several months and the only ruler in of the northern continent with any righteousness? It appears that you Ragusans are as brave as you are foolish. Begone, fiends, and be grateful that you are allowed to leave with your heads. We shall not be so merciful in the future!"   This was obviously going nowhere, so the delegation returned to their ships. Upon the docks a Galley stood, her flag whipping in the Wind. "So Long, Alexandria", said Duke Dzoric. He longed to return to his city and speak a language more comfortable to his ears.   The Mamluks watched and waited. Just a couple, all armed. "Set sail", screamed Dzoric when a small child began running toward the boat. Her owner screamed after he, ordering her to return. She boarded the ship and clung to the Duke.   The Mamluks drew their weapons. "Return the girl!" they bellowed in their tongue, the armaments sharp and glistening in the Alexandrian sun.   The girl looked at the Duke, her eyes a pale brown. There were marks along her body, she had been beaten badly. He smiled. "This boat is Ragusan territory, and any slave who sets foot upon our soil is free. The girl stays with us."   Her owner cursed, the Mamluks approached and the Ragusan sailors drew swords. An impasse appeared likely, and the scene began to attract attention. "It is coin you desire, eh merchant?" taunted the slave-owner. "I have enough for the likes of you. Italians and Greeks. I know your type." He gestured with his purse.   The sailors laughed. They all knew the words. From the Duke, "Liberty is not sold for all the gold in the world." They set from there, back to the home city of Dubrovnik. At least they got something out of this. The Duke looked at the girl. "Libertas", he said. She said nothing, unknowing, but she would soon come to know its meaning.Summary:

But yeah we cuddled and spooned all night, no I didn't do anything more because I didn't want her to regret anything more importantly take advantage of her. Next morning she went to the bathroom and still came back and we were just enjoying each others warmth. We were talking alot the week after that, kinda died down. But we are going to the zoo soon, an informal date just to see how she feels towards me.Summary:

Summarize: Where to begin...   It was late during the fall 2015 term and I was browsing reddit while taking a dump at my coop job when I see a heartbreaking post on /r/uwaterloo titled, "Is Panda King closing forever?".   The day before I left town, I had finished my 6th stamp card and planned on using it when I get back. I always ordered the same thing. "2 items to go, fried rice, bbq chicken, and sesame shrimp" (sweet and sour pork on the days they didn't have sesame shrimp) and I'd ask "is the free drink promotion still active?". But that is all gone now.   I decided to try the new place today seeing that it has the same chinese fast food layout as Panda King. I was baffled when I saw their menu. 1 meat with rice/noodles, 1 meat 1 veggie with rice/noodle, 2 meat 1 veggie with rice/noodle. I desperately looked for the 2 meat with rice/noodle option but its not there...   I'm a grown adult. I eat what I want. If I don't want my veggies I won't eat it. Being a grown adult, "1 meat" is simply not enough. And before you ask why I don't just buy the 2 meat 1 veggie, Don't expect me to pay for something I'm going to throw away.   WHY DID YOU SEPARATE THE MENU INTO VEGGIE AND MEAT.Summary:
Summarize: My girlfriend caught me staring at what seemed to be a girls ass at the bar.  I had been waiting a long time to get the beer I was going to nurse for the rest of the night,  In my boredom my eyes wandered, not lustfully, but curiously.  I found myself staring at the tramp stamp of a princess jasmine costumed inseucurasaurus.  One of my favorite movies was Aladin, because you know, there's nothing more inspiring than magic, princesses, and the notion that the only way to elevate oneself from poverty is finding a magic lamp.   I have three wishes?  Funny how that fantasy always follows the phrase "I want" not need but "want".  I think the really hard part is trying to find the biggest hook to keep myself from realizing that i'm in an endless loop.  The very fact that the Pronoun I is used seems to cement this argument with fallacy.  That being said, can any logical thought that proceeds the word "I" be considered anything short of completely Narcissistic?   I saw a girl dressed in a thin turquoise piece of fabric.  The only thing left to the imagination was what she looked like before she started favoring hookups over  sit-ups.  I don't know if it was the one too many pity pounds packed on from that bad break up, you know, the one that that had her grazing the glazed donuts at the grocery, wishing the underachieving, pimple nosed cashier would paint her life 50 more or so shades of gray. , or the tramp stamp so subtly covering the entire bottom of her back,  like a runway into the limitless depths of some abyss,  She got my attention, but she was no princess.  But she demanded attention, everything about it screamed "I'm important!"  There's that I again, we all want things.  Unfortunately I am not drunk enough to waste one of my wishes to portray myself as some prince, Quidich broom in hand, to sweep you off your feet and save you from the perils of the middle class!  No, I would rather not focus on the things that beg for attention.   I like jellyfish, there's one species in particular that's called the "immortal jellyfish" because it can perpetually revert back to its child state, and theoretically live for thousands of years.  Jellyfish don't care about that though.  Jellyfish just rides the tide, no room for I's me's my's or why's and it gets immortality.   I just want this hangover to go away.Summary:

(plus, holy Batman phrases!) are blocked for me, but this is my first job (out of a Meijer station) and I think I have to do a good job.
Summarize: So I was called to work for a company to update, consolidate and make shipping matrices (essentially a semi-automated worksheet that makes it easier to decide how much of something to buy when building a specific model of something) with the assumption that it would be a 2 or 3 month project (their hypothesis, I didn't know what they wanted me to do... I heard matrices and thought that mathematical matrices, but I said I would look and try) and if things were okay, they could hire me permanently. However, it's been 5 days and I've almost finished. It's been recommended by many people to look like I'm busy while I'm not busy so I a) don't get rid of a job and b) don't give the company time to decide whether to commit, but it's my first job (outside a gas station or Meijer) and have no idea how to do that.
Summarize: My boyfriend (of a year) and I have this mutual gay friend, we'll call him Dan, who is beyond amazing, everyone falls in love with him. Recently, my boyfriend has become very friendly with Dan.   A few weeks ago, my boyfriend spent the weekends drinking and all our friends would go out and we would just chill at my friend's house. When my boyfriend became a little too drunk, he would get touchy with Dan but I brushed it off because it was just him being drunk, right? The thing is, a few months back, my boyfriend held Dan's hand for a while as a "joke" but neither of them moved away. Now when my boyfriend was drunk, he returned to holding Dan's hand but I acted oblivious.   After that, Dan become more quiet than usual because I think he became very impacted that my boyfriend was sorta leading him on. And that is not the first instance where it has occurred. This is probably the third or fourth time.   I confronted the SO about it and it turns out, he's just very confused because Dan is beyond amazing. Anyways, I asked him talk it out with Dan and turns out, Dan's feelings are mutual but I don't know, it lead up to nothing. I don't know what to do or how to deal with the situation. That was a while back and now we act as if nothing happened but I cannot get over it.Summary:

Summarize: This happened last night, not today. Warning wall of text. Sorry for my bad writing skills, I have never been a good writer   Some background information. My Grandpa is in his mid 70s and for the longest time he has wanted an iPad. About 2 years ago my father caved in and bought him one. The biggest problem with him having an iPad is, he doesn't really know how to use it. So when a problem arises he calls my dad to come over and "fix" it or he brings it over to the house. As of recently my dad has given me the task of fixing the iPad.   Yesterday was Yom Kippur and traditionally my Grandparents come over to the house for break the fast. When my Grandpa arrived he told me there was a problem with his iPad and I told him I would fix it. He explained to me that he needed to change the credit card that was linked to his Amazon account. So I took the iPad into the other room to sit on a chair and opened up Safari. And you know what he had open? PORN. I assumed my Grandpa accidentally tapped on a ad and didn't realise it. I went to delete the tab, but I had to bring up every other tab that was open. And every other tab was PORN. Gay porn, Straight porn, Lesbian porn and much more. I rushed to tap on private browsing which deletes all the tabs, but he was already in private browsing. At this point I realised that my Grandpa was aware of what he was doing, it wasn't an accident. I was so freaked out that I had to put the iPad down for a minute and gather myself.   I minute later I went to Amazon and fixed the problem. While waiting for the page to load, I looked at his favorites at the top of the page. Half were porn, half were baseball stuff. I finally gave the iPad back to my Grandpa and he asked me to explain what I did so he can fix it in the future. After explaining I went to the bathroom to wash my hand (just to be safe no unwanted chemicals were picked up while handling the iPad).   Then it hit me. This explains a few things that happened to me as a child. While over at my Grandparent's house when I was in 4th grade. I went on their computer to go YouTube and it suggested YouPorn instead. I assumed that my prepubescent self searched this up in the past and didn't delete the history. Now having seen YouPorn open on my Grandpas iPad, I knew it was him who went on the website.   Another event was an email I got from my Grandpa in 5th grade. It said "Check out my pink car". I opened the email and there was a picture of a hot girl on a pink car. As I scrolled down the girl started to strip down and rub her tits on the car. I freaked out when I saw this and immediately deleted the email and even deleted it from the trash. I later asked my Grandpa if he sent me an email about his pink car, but he claimed he didn't know what I was talking about. So at the time I thought it was a spam email that got through. Nope, it was an email my grandpa was sharing with his friends.   Here's the worst part of this story. I know that my dad knows there is porn on my Grandpas iPad. My dad has fixed the iPad in the past and once when I started to fix the iPad, my Dad took it away from me saying "I have to do it this time" when I was going on Safari. Even though my dad knew there was porn on my Grandpas iPad, he let me see it. Thanks Dad.Summary:

Summarize: Symmetra has a problem. I would argue that Symmetra is the worst hero in the entire roster of 21, and is desperate need of a change. I won't argue that she is underpowered, because that's simply not true. In fact she is my highest win rate, and one of my most played heroes. However, she has a host of problems that should be addressed. The purpose of this post is to compile a list of problems with Symmetra, in the hopes that one day, we can have a fourth well rounded support hero.   Symmetra fills too narrow a niche.   Now there is no shortage of heroes in this game that fill a niche. Reaper is a tank shredder, tracer is a flanker and Torbjorn and Bastion can find value on virtually any point of defence (even occasionally offence). However, Symmetra only finds positive value on the first (occasionally second) point. Of course that is not to say that she is useless on the final points, but rather than she doesn't provide enough value to justify picking her over another hero.   The main reasoning here is obvious. A significant portion of Symmetra's value is found in her teleporter. Her teleporter is incredibly powerful in the opening points of any map, but as the game shifts towards the final points, the run from the spawn room to the battle is negligible compared to the respawn timer itself. Additionally, as the battle moves closer to the spawn door, the potential locations for the teleporter run out. The enemy is running around your flanks, and anywhere that you may hide it could very well be further away than your spawn door.   A secondary reason she falls off I'm value in later games is her sentries. Her sentries by virtue of their cool down require time to set up, but unfortunately on the last point, time is scarcely on your side. While Symmetra's damage without the turrets can be significant certainly, particularly when covering tight hallways or doorways, however she is incredibly fragile, with no mobility abilities to aid her. She does definitely have heroes she is very strong against, but they are few and far between. On the final point on defence, you're generally better off picking almost any other hero, to do more damage and have an ultimate that can provide real value.   Symmetra cannot support a team alone.   In Overwatch, certainly if you wish to play competitively, a healer is required on your team. Whether this is good for the game or not is a matter for another conversation, but currently, the point stands that Symmetra cannot solo support a team. She provides virtually no health recovery (beyond the regeneration her tiny shields provide), and a far too small amount of damage absorption. Because of the lack of the core function of support, many have said that Symmetra would be more at home as a defence hero.   It's not so crazy. Her sentry turrets, her shield, and a high damage main weapon... Sounds allot like Torbjorn. While her teleporter is definitely more of a support ability than molten core, a hero needs to be more than it's ultimate.   For Symmetra to break out of her niche and be an effective as a support hero, she needs to provide more than turrets and teleporters. She needs to make all her teammates better, which brings me to the biggest problem with Symmetra.   Symmetra's shield ability is badly designed at it's core.   Blizzard has designed the vast majority of abilities in this game beautifully. But this ability stands out as a bizarre anomaly that has no place in his game. Let's look at the major features of a good ability:   An ability must provide a noticeable effect.   Symmetra's most definitely provides a noticeable, and even significant benefit to Tracer or Genji, however on other heroes like Widowmaker (who doesn't use the 25 additional HP allot) or Roadhog (who has so much HP that 25 More is barely noticeable), it's effect is not noticeable or interesting.   An ability must present interesting choices for the caster.   The shield is the absolutely most boring ability in the whole game. It's a fire and forget ability with virtually no cooldown, that is to be cast immediately whenever you can. Waiting to apply it provides no additional value. There's no choice of optimal target. You apply 5 shields at the start of the game, and a new one every time the targeting reticle pops up, or someone comes out of the teleporter.   An ability must provide interesting choices to the opponent.   Now this doesn't apply to all abilities in the game, but it does to most. Most of the time, when an opponent uses an ability, you can choose how to react. Reinhardt's shield changes your aiming priorities, widowmaker's infrasight forces you to abandon any sneaky behaviour you had in mind for a bit, even Torbjorn's armour packs applied to an opponent may cause a Reaper or a Tracer to rethink them as a juicy target. Symmetra's shield doesn't provide enough additional HP to even provide that choice.   What is to be done?   Symmetra is always going to be a niche hero, more valuable on defence than offence, but currently, she is shoehorned into only some parts of most maps, and she doesn't provide enough support to justify her position as a support hero. I am certain that overhauling the most boring ability in the game is at least a partial solution. Providing her with a more interesting ability that provides more of an impact when it matters may allow her to provide her team with more value and support in a wider variety of situations. While I am by no means an ability designer, especially in terms of numbers, a significantly larger short duration shield, on a similarly short cooldown may allow her to provide some real support to allies in a fight. It's support without healing. This could make her a little too strong in her current niche roles, but possibly tweaking her sentry turret's damage could balance it out somewhat.   So let's make Symmetra symmetrical. Valuable on both sides of the fence, offence and defence.Summary:

Summarize: And I honestly feel that -3 LP was worth it.   I got into queue and these two guys had apparently played last game together and they were like, "oh... its you... e_e" and then they proceeded to just tell everyone about how bad the other was in last game I.E. "feeder brand 0/12 in lane", "no mias" etc.   And I just felt sorry for the other two guys I was with who just wanted to play a game without a couple of bitching 12 year olds. And so I told everyone that I was going to dodge because already, no one wanted to play that game and it was obvious they weren't going to work together to try and pull out a win.   So I dodged. I looked at my profile and saw the minus 3 points (Gold II 54 LP) and I didn't feel bad... I felt good. I knew that I somehow made a difference to those two other people in the queue and I wish them the best of luck on their next games.   If you're wondering why I shared this its because I want people to know that there are GOOD people in the LoL community and if you look for them, you'll find them ;)   -The Sovereign of SuaveSummary:

Summarize: MY wife and I are currently living in a two-bedroom/one-bath condo (~900sf) with two kids (boy 6yo and girl 8yo). Just moved here about a month ago to save some money while I stitch careers.   Our kids share the master suite as they have more stuff than my wife and I do, and we really don't need a large bedroom. All we need is enough room for our queen-bed, a couple dressers, and two-tree feet of room to walk around the bed.   We were used to larger living situations, my wife grew up in a four-bedroom +3000sf home all her life and I always lived in a similar sized place.   Just the other day my wife said she was very satisfied. I on the other hand could use a garage/basement/workshop for tools and messy projects.   Even with only one child though it would be extremely difficult to live in a one-bedroom place. It would be fine for the first six months, but after that you accumulate a lot of kid's stuff and want more privacy fromt he children. But really that is a Western cultural ideal. Some cultures don't require as much privacy and will have whole families in a small one-room building.Summary:

Summarize: My ex [21F] and I broke up a year ago. We dated for almost 4 years and she was manipulative, borderline uncaring, and cheated on me, which ended the relationship. I lost my virginity to her, which I regret. I have no idea why we stayed together. There was this deep attraction to each despite how terrible we were as a couple. I don't understand.   Fast forward to today. I've been dating my new girlfriend for about 7 months and I have never been happier. She's everything I could ever have hoped for. She's beautiful and funny and we completely click. I'm madly in love and unless something drastically changes for either of us, I could see us getting married somewhere down the road.   So my question is why the hell do I still think about my ex all the time. We broke up a long time ago and the relationship I'm in now is better in every way possible. I have absolutely no regrets breaking up with my ex. It's one of the best decisions I've ever made. I suppose I should also put in here that we tried staying in touch for a little while, but that we haven't spoken in several months. When I think about her all I think is stuff like "I hope she realizes what she let go." Crap like that. I don't get it.Summary:
Summarize: When people cite behavioural reasons, I hope that they mean intended behaviour. As in, the muscle has evolved to be that way, because that is how the muscle is typically used in that species. This is the same way that they might say a birds beak is long so they can dig for worms. Feeding a sparrow worms would not enlarge the beak.   Remember that  heavy  activity is more indicative of white meat. The important change you would make to the chicken behaviour would be the  sustained  flapping. But I digress. The short answer is maybe.   You are born with a particular set of muscle fibres and they stay that way. When you train your muscles and they get larger, what is happening is that each individual muscle fibre gets larger; they do not increase in number. This means that if you were able to train only 1 type of fibre within the muscle using endurance training, that fibre may get larger than the other type. In theory this would lead to a darker colour to the flesh. The problem with chicken breast is that if it's almost entirely type II fibres, then increasing the relative size of type I will not change the overall colour very much.Summary:

Summarize: Basically I broke up with my ex of 2 years and 9 months because we didn't have feelings for eachother anymore and I am ready to date again, I feel like my confidence is high enough to talk to a girls, but I guess you can say I "forgot" how to talk to one and what to say exactly. I get incredibly nervous and basically I don't know what to say. Any advice on what I can do to keep my cool and break the ice?Summary:

Summarize: Most people aren't actually 100% healthy, so that's one thing to keep in mind -- or if they are "healthy" it's only in so far as they know at the present moment and problems may be arising. And if you're not eating a whole foods based diet with plenty of plants, then you're probably at sub-optimal levels of nutrients (note that the RDIs may not be optimal, just acceptable). And then factor in things like antioxidants and other phytonutrients... There are chemicals in plants that are literally anti-carcinogenic and help to combat the daily onslaught of carcinogens and such.Summary:
Summarize: Hi there!   I'm going to be applying to the JET program so I can become a Assistant language teacher in Japan. I need a reference letter from a professor, preferably in my faculty (MBB).   I only know one professor on a personal level and that's because I did a NSERC with him, however things did not go well during my summer working for him. I made a few mistakes, to the point he had to have a private talk with me. The graduate students were very aggressive towards  the undergrads (swearing, ignoring, talking behind their backs, a lots of drama) to the point one of the other undergrads broke down and cried and the professor did nothing for support. It was a hostile work place, absolutely awful. The experience made me regret my entire degree, I don't think I can work in a research lab again. The three other undergrads share the same feelings.   I contacted this professor to talk to him, so I can ask him for a reference anyways. it was worth a shot. However, I missed my meeting with him by getting stuck in gridlock traffic with no phone because of a massive accident on highway 1 in north vancouver. I was 20 minutes late and he wasn't available anymore. Everything that could have gone, did go wrong. he said I can see him on Monday instead. We are not on the best terms, I don't think he likes me and I fucked up again. Not sure if he will give me reference.   So how do I go about getting a reference from another professor? do I have to visit their office hours every single week? any tips?

Summarize: To resolve these issues I'd suggest 'Ask once, then deal with it appropriately'.     Take clothes that are lying around and pile them in front of their door. If they don't move them for a week, throw them outside.   Same as above, throw in front of their door or throw outside.   Let milk sit out for a week. Then label it as yours. See if they enjoy it. Same with other food that is difficult to tell if it is bad or not. Ask for compensation.   Ask them to wash the towel. If they don't, take one of theirs.   Tell them that was a wise investment.   Was it your pre-amp? Tell them negligence doesn't excuse destruction, and not paying attention to the road and hitting another car doesn't excuse a ticket and consequences. They're not 6, 'I didn't know' is not a viable excuse anymore. If they don't know, ask.   There are noise laws, and if it exceeds the decibel range for the time of day or exceeds a time of 15 minutes (at least in my town) where it is disrupting your life you can get quite a few fines racked up against them.     Ideally, pick your roommates better. I've never had a problem that lasted, and I've lived on my own for the past 9 years (29 now) in dorms, houses and apartments.

Even with other foods that are hard to say whether it's bad or not. Ask them to be compensated. Ask them to wash the towel. If they don't, take one of theirs. Tell them it was a wise investment. Is it your preamp? Tell them that negligence doesn't excuse destruction, and don't pay attention to the road and hit another car doesn't excuse a ticket and the consequences.
Summarize: In order to solve these problems, I would suggest 'Ask once, then treat it appropriately'. Take clothes that lie around and stack them in front of their door. If they don't move them for a week, throw them out. As above, throw them out at their door or throw them out. Let milk sit for a week. Then label it as yours. See if they enjoy it. Same with other foods that are hard to say whether it's bad or not. Ask for compensation. Ask them to wash the towel. If they don't, take one of them. Tell them that a smart investment. Was it your pre-amp? Tell them negligence not apologise destruction, and don't pay attention to the road and beat another car not apologise for a ticket and follow. They're not 6, 'I didn't know' is no more viable excuse. If they don't know, ask. There are noise laws, and if it exceeds the decibel range for the time of the day.
Summarize: Ahh the age old group bathroom excursion question. I will try to explain to the best of my womanly abilities this strange female habit. I do believe there are two reasons why women travel to the bathroom in groups: firstly, and most prevalently, it happens because it has always happened. Pretty disappointing right? I know it's totally dumb but it's just one of those social pressures that women have to learn and then adhere to in order to get along with other women. For men a similarity might be the internal bathroom etiquette of not talking and spacing in urinals. At some point you had to learn this behavior, because it is expected of you to adhere to it. I could go into my theories for why I think the lady habit began in the first place but this comment is already long enough. Now the second reason, is why I personally adhere to this pack bathroom nonsense. Reason #2: there is safety in numbers. Rape, molestation, harassment are always an issue for women. Everyday you have to be aware that your safety from the opposite sex is not guaranteed and therefore must protect yourself. And the best deterrent from getting caught alone in one of those scary rape trap bathrooms out there is having 3 other friends that are down to kill a muthafucka for you. This is also why I have always only kept athletic female friends, but that's just a personal preference.Summary:

Summarize: UPDATE:  Thanks to /u/TiedinHistory ([here]( I looked into it more and discovered that only the first two tests are covered by the ACA. Since my plan excludes all routine and other preventive testing, I will still be left with a ~$500 bill after getting Quest to bill with correct codes.   What are some ways to reduce it? Should I try negotiating directly with Quest saying they can send it to collections for 10% or I could pay them $100? In one of the threads here I've also seen someone mentioning getting the lab to bill the physician and paying the physician the discounted rate/getting them to write it off. Do you think that's a possibility since they referred me to Quest?     During my annual physical last year the doctor ordered some general lab tests and STI screening. A few months later I got a bill for $1300 from Quest Diagnostics.   Long story short, after 3 months of calls to the lab, the insurance company, and the doctor and about 5 resubmitted claims to the insurance company, I got $600 of that amount covered (at one point UnitedHealthcare split the claim into two) . However, it seems like I hit a brick wall with the remaining $700. The insurance company keeps rejecting this claim and saying that it is not medically necessary (routine tests not meeting preventive care guidelines). The claim has the following tests:   (CPT code - Test)     86706 - Hepatitis B   87389 - HIV   80053 - Comprehensive Metabolic Panel   86695 - Herpes Simplex   82306 - Vitamin D Assay   86696 - Herpes Simplex     Diagnosis (ICD-9) codes: V70.0 (main), V72.62, V74.5   The doctor claims that he didn't order anything besides the basic and STI tests, which are always covered for his patients. I looked at the Affordable Care Act guidelines, and it says those things should be covered for free (including Hepatitis B screening since I was born in Russia, which apparently puts me in a high risk category of having it).   When I bring up this fact to the UnitedHealthcare, they say they can't do anything because the CPT codes do not match with those in their table for preventive care (despite the Affordable Care Act). After some googling, I found one of their tables [here.](   When I call the lab, they say they did all the tests and billed everything according to the lab order from the doctor and that it's not their problem. When I call the doctor, they tell me to figure it out with the lab and the insurance company.   What would be the best way to proceed in this situation in your opinion? Is there a way to make the insurance cover it as preventive care (even though the codes don't match, the tests should still be covered by the ACA, right)? I definitely do not have $700 to pay for the lab and being stuck with 3 companies pointing fingers at each other and trying to make money off of me is pretty frustrating. I will appreciate any help navigating the US health system!Summary:
The Summarize tests are like the medically not tested. The medically not medically not medically not medically. ([here] I have been in the medicine, the medicine, the medicine, the medicine and not medicine) only the first two tests are covered by the medicine. Since my plan closes all routine and other preventive tests, I'll still be using a ~ $500 bill after receiving quest with correct codes. What are some ways to reduce them? Should I try directly with Quest to say they can send it to collections for 10% or I could pay them $100? In one of the topics here I have also mentioned to someone that the laboratory to calculate the doctor and STI screening. A few months later I got an invoice for $1300 from Quest Diagnostics. Long history short, after 3 months of calls to the laboratory, the insurance company, and the doctor and over 5 resubmitted claims to the insurance company that I got.
Summarize: If you're looking for another game like Phoenix Wright, namely heavy narration, murder investigation, courtroom setting, presenting evidence, naming culprits, and finding contradictions, a Japanese PSP game called [Dangan-Ronpa]( just recently got a [translation patch](   The game can be described as a cross between Phoenix Wright and Battle Royale (999 would work too). The basic premise is that for some unknown reason, 15 high school students have been sealed inside Hope Academy. They all woke up inside the school unconscious at their desks. They find that all the windows have been boarded shut, and the front door sealed. They are told by the headmaster, [Monokuma]( that they have the choice of either living in the school indefinitely, or "graduating". In order for a student to "graduate", they must murder another student. After the murder is discovered, students are free to investigate, and a Class Trial is held. The remaining students must determine who the killer is. If they pick correctly, the killer is executed. Otherwise, everyone except the true killer is executed, and the killer is free to leave. The investigations and trial play out very much like Phoenix Wright, and there's a much larger continuous story to all these murders and trials.Summary:

Summarize: While I agree that 3rd person perspective ruins the immersion, I cannot agree with the WOT spotting mechanic. It's true that it follows some clear rules but that doesn't change the fact that sometimes it's just too silly (i.e.: you spot a tank destroyer 200m away moving, then he stops to shoot you and in 5 seconds it disappears, but he's still there under an invisible cloak).   Arma/Dayz is the only game I know with such a huge vew distance and I appreciate it due to this. If you implement such a RNG mechanic, it will hurt it a lot.   EDIT:I am subjective since I really didn't like that spotting mechanic in WOT. I like the one in War Thunder though. You can still see a dot where the enemy is but you don't know what it is.Summary:
Summarize: I once sold a Jetta to a random guy for $3500, it blue-booked around $4k.  I left the sale price blank on the bill of sale and title.  The next day, the guy called and told me he put $1500 as the sale price.   Shrug, okay .   I got a call from the DMV a couple days later asking me to describe the vehicle.  It genuinely did need some work - the clutch was due for replacement, it hadn't had its timing belt done per the schedule, it needed new tires, etc.  I explained all of this and then never heard about it again.  I suspect it would have been a different story if I had described the car as being in mint mechanical condition and in need of no repairs.Summary:
Summarize: There are a number of reasons for this.   For starters, there is a firm tradition of Jewish influence in the United States. After Israel, there are more Jews in the USA than anywhere else on the planet-- between five and eight million, depending on how religion and ethnicity are constructed. The Jewish vote [consistently] ( predicts the presidential election; Jewish groups have considerable clout in lobbying and politics. Anti-semitic stereotypes notwithstanding, there are a lot of prominent Jewish business owners, particularly in finance and banking: Goldman Sachs, Bloomberg, Citigroup, Kuhn, Loeb & Co., etc. They are also prominent in other business, particularly publishing and media. [Here are some prominent Jewish businessowners.] (   The evangelical vote is actually  not  a very substantive indicator of US support of Israel, because the evangelical movement really only gained traction in the US in the late 20th century: > In the 1980s and ’90s the Evangelical movement greatly expanded. The reconciliation of conservatives from the Reformed tradition (Presbyterian and Baptist) with those from the Methodist tradition (Holiness and Pentecostal) was an important step in the growth of the movement. These two groups had been bitter rivals but joined forces against the perceived secularization of American culture. [Link] (   Conversely, US support of Israel can be traced to its inception in 1948. American success and Jewish business are very firmly linked, and as a result America has thoroughly thrown its support behind Israel-- although this has waned in recent years because of Netanyahu's more aggressive settlement policies. Either way, you don't throw a 70 year alliance under the table because some people don't like your policies.   What does the US get out of its relationship with Israel? The continued support of one of its most eminent and financially stable minorities, plus the support of other Western nations (namely the UK) who also have sizeable Jewish populations and a special relationship with Israel.   So the second half of your question: the US relationship with other states.   After 9/11, people constructed the US relationship with Arab states in the Middle East far differently than it actually was. The US and Saudi had an incredibly fruitful relationship for decades, based largely in oil spending. When it was revealed that the 9/11 attackers were largely Saudi, there was, of course, a massive backlash-- but the USA never went to war with Saudi, because the business was too good and the extremism was far too easy to pin on other countries with less authoritarian governments (Afghanistan) or more openly fascist ones (Iraq.) Public disapproval of Muslim countries, paired with the discovery of oil in Canada in massive amounts, meant that the US pulled back from Saudi.   What are the other countries in the region to deal with? Well, the USA has attempted to ally itself with the rising stars of the UAE and Qatar, but so far that seems to be a relatively incidental business relationship. Either way, that support will be in business and not in ideology: support for Israel isn't going anywhere.Summary:

Summarize: Freshman year- My Gf and I had been out most if the night at a friends apartment making weed butter and then a bunch of edibles. Between all the butter that had gotten on us while we cooked and all the edibles we ate we are both sky high. We get back to my on campus apartment, nobody's home. My three roommates all stumble in loudly about 30 mins later drunk as hell, they had been a some party. We are sharing the stories of our nights when we suddenly hear a shriek from outside. We are all fucked up so none of us really react until we hear a girl running down our hall screaming "help help!" Me and my four roommates all rush outside, my gf and a couple other girls stay behind in the room. We get in the hall and this panicked girl is just sayin"upstairs upstairs please you guys have to do help!" We are all way too fucked up to know what to do so we all just bolt for the stairs and run up to the third floor. We throw open the door to the hall to just see the walls covered in blood. Like fucking everywhere in HUGE streaks across the walls and big semi-soaked in puddles on the carpet. Despite being high as shit I am the most sober one of the four of us so i took the lead and ran towards this writhing body on the ground, then notice there is a girl crying hysterically nearbye and some shirtless dude holding her. This kid we all knew is just in a heap on the floor, he has this massive gash on his head that is just hemorrhaging blood and there is this huge rock like two feet to his left covered in blood. So I grab the kid and using what training I can remember while I'm so fucked up my roommates and I try to to talk to him and carefully rolled him onto his back. Although the whole time he keeps trying to sit up and grab at the rock while  making this just like guttural moan. " Jack (not his real name) what's going on?" "Unnnnnggggg" "Jack come on dude speak to me what the fuck happened." "Unnnnngggggg" roommates:"Steve what do we do?!?" "Shit, well if he can't communicate we don't have a choice call 911" (bear in mind we all liked this kid and new that if we called the paramedics and cops this would be it for him at school) roommates look at me hesitantly but say" alright FUCK" So roommate A runs off to call for help while B,C, and I try to piece together what's happening while stopping the blood from gushing out of jacks head. Shirtless dude" we were watching a movie and suddenly we hear a knock on the door, Girl went to answer it and as soon as she opened the door this crazy fucker just decked her in the face!" Although he didn't elaborate more we were never sure how much of the damage on jacks body was dealt by shirtless guy but I have no doubt it was more than a little. While he is telling this to roommate C I am looking jack over and that's when I look in his eyes to see they were dark red and had pupils the size of dimes" FUCKING SHIT! He's high out of his god damned mind!" Turns out elsewhere on campus earlier that night jack had eaten several candies laced with LSD and was tripping his balls off. So anyway at around that point two cops, one of which I had a bit of a history with suddenly burst into the hallway guns drawn. We all throw our hands up as we are being aimed at and so jacks head starts gushing more blood. "What the fuck is going on?!" Dick cop yells "Don't shoot! We found him like this, he needs attention now! Also I think he's on drugs because he is completely nonresponsive, and keeps trying to hit himself with that rock!" I shouted gesturing to the big bloody stone. The cops thankfully lowered their guns and holstered them but then dick cop pulls out his taser and starts threatening jack with it ordering him to get down and comply or be tased. Roommates B,C,and Start yelling" No STOP! He doesn't understand what your saying let us just hold him down he's fine he just needs medical attention!" "Back away from him NOW!" So we all stood up, pretty well covered in blood, and did as he said. Jack pulled himself towards the wall and leaned against it but roommate B grabbed the rock and moved it away from Jack, who still kept reaching for it and the cop kept threatening to taze him if he kept moving, not that jack understood. Eventually the paramedics arrived and carted away Jack, and treat the girl who got a huge black eye. Never heard from jack again personally but B did and he said that according to Jack he had no recollection of how he wound up in our building or why he punched the Girl, but that he kept hitting himself with the rock because he saw it as his brain and was scared if he didn't get it back into his head he would die.   So ya that was the craziest thing I saw in college although I do have some other good stories as well. Always remember kids, drugs can be fun, but they can also be very very VERY dangerous.

Summarize: Visually speaking, Reksai IS underground and Anivia is on ground level. It would make sense that Reksai can go underneath all walls as his tunnels are like that of a walls (unleash you are implying that azir's wall goes down to the core of summoner's rift). The fact that Reksai can dig under every obstacle in summoner's rift I think proves that he is deeper than a 'diglet'. The solution to this problem is not 'realism' it's simply recognizing that while Reksai' is using E azir's ult shouldn't effect him. For example, does it make sense that tristana should be caught by Caitlyn trap while she's in midair? Fixing this issue would not muddle clarity.

Summarize: Alright Reddit, I come to you with a pretty long story..   My girlfriends family lives in another country than mine. She moved here about 2 years ago, but visits her family over the summer. Since we've been together since September, this was the first summer she left to go to her home country with us being in a relationship.   The thing is though, I'm pretty jealous. She told me all these stories about how she was going out with her old friends again and how much fun she was having at the club. I was happy she was happy, but I got pretty jealous as well. She's very naive, and from her stories alone I could tell some of her 'friends' we're definitely into her.   So I get jealous and some arguments ensue. She feels guilty even though she's isn't doing anything I feel insecure. At the end of every argument we make up. We maybe had 4 of these arguments.   So after 2 months I come over. Couldn't come any earlier thanks to school. we meet at the airport and things are great. We talk so much, have a lot of fun and the sex was great. Half a week in we were sitting on the couch and she was browsing facebook. Suddenly a message pops up from her best friend asking about how were doing. She clicks it away and I get curious. Later that night were watching a movie on her laptop and she falls asleep. Being too curious I stupidly open her facebook and check for the message. She replied saying were all good and we've sorted things out. Even though I know snooping only brings trouble, I scroll up a bit.   There I read, a week before I got there, how she was telling her best friend how she was snapchatting with John and got butterflies. He apparently asked for drinks, in a friends way, and she said she was hoping he'd ask that.   I'm heartbroken. The next day I subtly ask her if she still has feelings for him, and she tells me no.   Now John is her ex. They dated for a bit but then they broke it off. This several months before we met. I'm okay with her talking to her ex, since I still talk to mine. Truth is she did ask me if I was okay with her going for drinks to catch up with him.   I don't know what to do reddit. I love this girl, but if I confront her about it she'll probably break up because of my trust issues, or the relationship will be poisoned. I can't break up with her either since I'm still here for a week and a half and can't afford an hotel.   I keep telling myself she only felt those things because of the fights, but this is just a lame excuse ofcourse.   I'm 100% sure she hasn't cheated on meSummary:

She's very naive, and of her stories alone I could tell some of her 'friends' we're definitely in her. So I'm jealous and some arguments ensue. She feels guilty even if she doesn't do everything, I feel insecure. At the end of every argument that we make a few things public.
She met here two years ago, but visits her family during the summer. Since we’ve been together since September, this was the first summer she left to go to her home country with us in a relationship. The thing is, I’m pretty jealous. I could tell some of her 'friends' stories that we’re definitely in it. So I got jealous and some arguments that happen to her. She feels guilty even though she’s not doing anything I feel insecure. At the end of every argument we make up. We even had 4 of these arguments that tell her that she was also in contact with her.

Summarize: Gave myself the gift of Battleship Galaxies for Christmas and played it tonight with my almost-12 yr old son. He picked up on it fairly quickly, even though he hasn't played that many wargames. He had some of the concepts (energy allocation especially) from playing Starfleet Command with me on the computer.   The ships are quite nice, though I'm concerned that some of the finer details (antenna, guns) might break off with less than careful handling. One gripe is that the ship's stands slide a little too easily on the game board. I may try to find some sticky-backed rubber pads to combat accidental nudges...   Adding and removing the shield/damage pegs to the ship's stand was challenging for my older fingers. My son had no such problems...the magic of youth!   The ships and weapons systems for each side were different enough that it felt to me that we were actually playing different races that due to differences in technology, made different trade-offs in the design of their ships. The Wretch seem to have better shield tech, while the ISN compensated by having thicker hull armor.   Overall, we had fun playing this game. It started slowly, but as we became familiar with the game mechanics our later turns went much faster. A nice touch was the inclusion of two cards with the sequence of events during a turn -- one for each side -- that was a handy reference of what to do next.   He beat me just as we finished one pass through our decks.Summary:

Summarize: The Bitcoin economy could easily expand to 20 trillion dollars, and that is far more coverage than even the USD. At that stage a satoshi would be equal to a USD penny.   The Bitcoin protocol can be modified to add further division of units if necessary (which apparently is fairly easy to do and I'm certain the network would accept further division of units in the future so uptake of those changes would be very possible), but to assume that Bitcoin is going to supplant every currency in the world, even, someone as optimistic as myself thinks that is a bit ludicrous.Summary:

Summarize: So I'll keep this short, about 7 months ago (by recommendation from this subreddit), I built my own gaming PC. Trying to think of the best upgrade now.   Specs;     8gb Corsair Vengeance RAM   AMD FX6300 CPU   Aftermarket CPU cooling   Sapphire Radeon r9 270 4gb OC   1tb HDD (considering moving to SSD)   Zalman Z11+ case     Recently got a gaming mouse, keyboard and headphones. Play on a 42 inch 1080p LCD TV.   Anyhow, I have some spare cash (about £150 $200), and seeing as gaming is a major hobby of mine I figure I'd invest it.   Considered a few things.     Upgrading RAM to 16gb (don't see much point though tbh)   Using a projector (probably too complicated for my room)   Moving to SSD (not sure it's worth it, they are expensive)     So that's pretty much what I'm asking for help with, what would be a wise upgrade? Doesn't have to be a PC part per say - could be a useful gadget or anything related.Summary:
Summarize: Which was why I said I'm not arguing that it's why he included it. But if it was true that the biggest cause for abdominal stretch marks was pregnancy, then men would never have them. While pretty obvious that he's alluding to pregnancy here (considering the context used), I was simply pointing out that your continued assertions that they make up most of those type of stretch marks is just flat out incorrect. They just happen to be the most commonly associated cause because people keep saying that. ANYONE who has experienced a growth spurt in their midsection or rapid loss has them. The only reason we "know" that he's hinting at pregnancy is the context he used it in- not just that they're on her stomach.Summary:

Summarize: I have played all of the Ticket to Rides many times.  My favorite is the Nordic Countries map, but it only plays 2 or 3 players.  India is my second favorite, because of the Mandala rules and it seems like there are more difficult decisions to make (haven't really analyzed why this is, just seems that way to me).  Europe is my third favorite.   Between Europe and US, I much prefer Europe.  US is actually my least favorite map, even after adding the 1910 changes.  I think the reason I don't like the US map is that aggressive card drawing rarely pays off (maybe I am doing it wrong).  The other games, depending on how the game flows, sometimes it is correct to draw a bunch of routes and sometimes it is better not too.  With the US map, I feel that this strategic option isn't really there.Summary:

Summarize: I'm currently working in a small quant shop with the title "Director of Financial Technology" and pretty much act as the CTO + COO. I really lucked out and am happy to have landed the job that I do with full expectations of a long, prosperous relationship all the while getting invaluable training. That said, the idea of 'breaking' into the industry isn't so much of a concern for me but I do need to formalize my knowledge. My background is actually in Biochemistry where I was able to leverage my modeling experience there and in IT to get where I am now.   Over the next 5 years, I plan to play catch-up in filling out my resume to match the work that I do all the while working. The job is first priority. However, I will also get a masters -- I know that my background won't get me into any prestigious programs and to take many supplementary classes to try and get into one doesn't seem worth the time. Most top programs are full time anyways and breaking into the industry isn't such a huge concern right now so I will likely pursue a part-time, continuing education program e.g. John Hopkin's M.Sc. Applied Economics, Financial Economics concentration. I am expecting to finish this in 1.5 to 2 years. After the M.Sc., I plan to get a CFA. I expect to have finished Level 1 by the time I graduate and by the time I finish Level 3, I should be eligible for a CFA. Here is my conundrum -- neither the degree or the CFA gives any indication that I am well versed in quantitative finance and/or financial engineering.   So this is where the question comes in. It doesn't seem worth it to ever grab a MFE but certificates do seem feasible. I have been looking around and there are a few reputable schools that offer these online e.g. Columbia and University of Washington, but these are expensive and only offer 4 courses. On the other hand, there is something called the "Certificate of Quantitative Finance" (CQF) offered through a commercial entity (7City) but lead by Paul Wilmott! They also advertise access to their online videos in perpetuity that will be updated as time goes on. That sounds like a pretty sweet deal to me but it definitely lacks the brand name, which is kind of what this is about. Getting one from an accredited university and the CQF sounds kind of silly too as that is the exact logic that is steering me away from getting two masters in essentially the same area.   Anyways, that’s my story … What do you guys think?Summary:

Summarize: When I was around 8 me and my little brother (who was 4 at the time) made up a game. We would put a beanbag on our heads and shape it to look like we had beaks like a bird. The point of the game was to run at each other and knock the other one down which is kinda hard when you cant see each other. Imagine Marco polo, it was sorta like that but with beanbags.

Summarize: So, my new gf, 'Sheila' has a co-worker/friend 'Monique'.  A couple weeks ago, Monique (who is married with a child) confided in my gf that she had cybersex with one of their co-workers (not her husband).   She then told Sheila she felt bad about it, and had cut it off.   Fast forward to this Thursday.  Sheila tells me that Monique had sent her a text about spending the night at her house.  Sheila says yes.  Immediately Monique tells her that she isn't actually going to spend the night at her house, but it using it as a cover for her cheating on her husband.   When Sheila first brought this up, I made it clear how much it bothered me that her 'friend' was involving her in all of this.  I'm not by any means a moral standard-bearer or anything, and have made mistakes in the past but... I've been careful with Sheila to make sure our start, and our months together have been honest and straight forward and pure.... and this feels fucked.   I don't know if I'm putting too much pressure on her, because I feel like her accommodating her cheating friend somehow means something about our relationship (when maybe it doesn't)... but I just had to leave her house because she was defending Monique to a degree that made me want to not be there...   Am I being overly sensitive? WHAT DOES IT MEAN Help me reddit.  You are my only hope.  (just kidding, but i'd appreciate the input)Summary:

In addition, do you have problems if you take your trusty usb sticks and put them in your pc? It's the same thing, if you buy cheap shit off ebay you're going to have components that fail but surely the important ones will get to be implemented in their android (don't look at me like that, every single phone company has its own modified version of android, it's not a big deal to get the drivers in there). I'll give you that it's not going to be like arranging magnets on a fridge as a battery needs different connectors than a camera, but you don't need more pins between a 2mp camera and a 10 mp camera, especially not if you just upgrade the size of the lens. This would definitely work with some clever engineering. CPU's don't get smaller or larger, you will have a spot for the cpu. Doesn't matter if it's single or eight-core. Same goes for RAM. Then you'll have the battery in a place where you can extend it at the sacrifice of some other components and the rest will just be standard i/o.Summary:

Summarize: Mythic Grunt mech can be quite a challenge. Especially on the beach of Apex 7.   Some tips:     Try to use kinetic based weapons (Dmr, Br are best suited) since kinetic based weapons do extra damage towards vehicles.     The grunt's cockpit windshield can be broken and the grunt has (from what i know) 2 crit spots those being from the front which are it's middle area and the actual grunt itself when exposed from it's cockpit area.     Slow moving vehicles like the tank, scorpion are generally no bueno since the needlers the grunt fires have tracking and 1-3 needlers do massives amounts of damage and can potentially kill you, they are extremely powerful and the grunt mech is no pushover. Pay attention and when it's launching these red/orangish needlers in the air and take cover immediately.       The best way to keep fire/stay alive and not have that dreadful respawn is to take cover/shoot. Take cover, shoot. Repeat this and watch out for those tracking needlers! Stay safe! Better then "getting in" all that damage and dying in 5 seconds while you're in the open thinking you're safe, you're not!     Aerial vehicles are also such a huge target and will get absolutely melted in a matter of a few seconds. If you are using an aerial vehicle you can still be safe though! Just make sure to watch out for those tracking needles and have a "camping" spot to shoot, hide, shoot, hide. Rinse, repeat.Summary:

KLK on the other hand has a much smaller casting, and I think it works better. We actually had to see Elite Four Backstories, and they all have some screen time. I really find myself running for Gamagoori/Sanayyama (versus I wanted to root for Jorgun/Balinbow because of their cool design, but I didn't know the first thing about them).
Summarize: So yesterday I was having issues with my Internet so I went to my ISP and exchanged my modem for a new one. Today comes along and I fire up my PS4 only to have the new BLOPS patch fail to download. I go through some basic troubleshooting steps such as rebooting console, router, modem, rebuilding database, checked free HDD space (288.3 GB free), [some basic port forwarding]( putting PS4 into a DMZ, etc. Nothing works.   Then I get the bright idea to download an App (MLB app) and boom, no problem. So, thinking it might be a fluke, I delete YouTube, Netflix, Twitch, etc. All of them download flawlessly. Only games / patches won't download (tried downloading Rebel Galaxy, wouldn't work.)   I then try to use my phone as a portable hotspot and see if the patches work, and bingo, there they go.   I have no idea where to go from here. Should I get a new modem? Is there something glaringly obvious that I missed? Any suggestion would be appreciated.Summary:

Summarize: Two years ago, I was hanging out with a friend at uni, waiting with him for his dad to pick him up. His dad and brother roll up to us, and ask us if we wanted to go to the casino with them (Mind you, I was 18, as was his brother, and he was 20). We decided to go, because fuck it, what else is there to do?   We drive about an hour or so, smoke a couple of joints on the way, and all is going well. We got the casino and started walking around. I figured we were just going to hang out and sight see since we were not of age to gamble.   Well, this was not the case. While I had no money on me, my friend did, and he got some chips to play with. He gave me a $25 chip, and we proceed to sit at a $10 blackjack table, high as shit. Now, mind you, I was pretty scared that someone was going to ask us for I.D. as soon as we entered the gambling area. However, we got through and sat down with no problem.   After a few hours, I had turned my $25 chip into a pocketful of chips, about $275. We left that table, and went to the higher stakes tables, with $50 betting minimums. I broke even, my friend and his brother were up to about $500 at this point. We go to another table, and boy was that a good choice. We ended up sitting with several other folks, one of whom apparently really knew what he was doing, as he was telling everyone when to hit and when to bust, since it would benefit us all. I'd say about 85% of the time he was correct. This dude helped me more than double my money.   At this point, it was about 5 a.m. We decided to collect our money and cash out. I was worried they would ask us for I.D. here, but again, nothing. We cashed out our chips, totaling a little over $2000, and left.   Needless to say, I was psyched, I had $650 in my pocket after going with absolutely nothing, and we had a blast. My friend had left with $1100, and his brother had $440. Feels good, man.Summary:
Summarize: Yea, I can't imagine a scenario where Superman exists in the Dark Knight universe. I guess maybe if he was off planet fighting aliens or something... maybe. But that would require all 3 movies to take place  after  Man of Steel. Even then, Nolan's universe is too real, and it doesn't seem likely that there is any supernatural/alien shit going on.Summary:
Summarize: I live at home with my family. About a month ago or so I dove into a poor decision. I attempted to kill myself. I took roughly 700 mg of Baclofen (Lioresal or many other brand names) and started a whole huge ordeal. I am young, only 21 haven't really done much with my life but for the sake of the whole story I'll let it all out.   My childhood was kinda shitty, Beat by my dad and insulted by him for being kinda chunky. Kids aren't much better but hey all that was short term and wrapped up eventually at the end of middle school.   I was popular in high school and very active in sports, theater, and academics and had a fair portion of "friends" and a few really good buddies, as well as a girlfriend. my Senior year I blew out my arm in a really bad way and ruined my sports life and caused me to get a case of the "fuck its" ruining my academics and making my circle of social life shrink to nothing but basically my girlfriend and my best friend. Around this time another girl who was attractive began to show interest in me and i made the mistake of taking that too far and I kissed her. I reconciled with my SO it was done with and we moved on. Soon after we discovered that she was pregnant. we decide it would be best to take care of our baby ourselves.   She and I lived together and raised our son and we scraped by fairly well for a while, but I became more and more complacent and shut in. eventually I reached out and sent a text to the previous gal who almost ended us prior. (I know classy right?) she was devastated to say the least and we fought and I honestly for all the love I had for her I didn't fight to keep her even I truly did (and still do) love her. so we went our separate ways and it wasn't as bad as it could have been and we ended up with 50-50 custody.   But now here I am only me and my son who wasn't there half the week. I leeched into and dove into a relationship with that damn girl. I forced myself to believe that the remaining feelings I had for my ex were all for her and became cynical, irate, and vented all my sadness into one person who did the same to me. Both of us undeserving of this unhealthy abusive situation. eventually after over a year of that she breaks up with me which who the fuck blames her, I would have broke up with her but I was so fucked and unstable I needed someone.   Then almost too conveniently I came across these pills. I never truly planned to but I looked at them and a culmination of 3 years of failure to cope as a now jobless human fucking being sank in 2 year old son napping in the fucking house i began to take EVERY FUCKING ONE OF THEM before telling his mother what I did. Then I sent a text the ex and told her. She thought i was bluffing nothing more.   My son now picked up I get kitchen knife and sit in my closet and my family now beginning to check to see what was up as I'm calling my son's mother/my ex in a Psychotic break of apologies while telling my family to stay the fuck back that and that while telling them i was going to die.   That's when it got hazy. I ended up in the Icu for 3 days and had a few seizures and lucky for only that from what they told me. As well as about 5 days in a psych ward setting up out patient treatment.   so here i am. No friends, hospital bills, Guilt, and just all around fucked what the fuck do Now?Summary:

And now I've become a very popular girl in high school and very active in sports, theater and academics and had a fair portion of "friends" and a few very good friends, as well as a girlfriend.
Summarize: Irregardless" is NOT a proper word, and it means exactly the opposite of what you think it means. "Regardless" means without regard, or despite something. "Ir-" is a negative prefix, so adding it to any already negative word makes it a double negative. When you say "irregardless," you're literally saying "without without regard."Summary:
In summary: Unbiased" is not a real word, and it means exactly the opposite of what you think it means. "Unbiased" means without consideration, or despite something.

Summarize: So I just came from the Feed Me show in Philly (which was mindblowingly amazing :D) and I got to meet Jon after the show in a meet-and-greet. I asked him about the collab and here are some fun facts!   He and Sonny have been working on the track for a while, they started at the beginning of the year at Sonny's place and have messing with it on planes and stuff together. They last worked on it a month or two ago and took out the laser-type sound because they didn't think anyone liked it (I said I liked that sound, and he said maybe he'd consider throwing some lasers back in for me. Don't I feel special?), and they went with what they have now. He said maybe in the next few months, it'll come out, so relatively soon. He had a laugh when I said, "Skrillex Soon?"Summary:

Summarize: Let me get up here to my podium...   Surely, I am not the only person annoyed by the noirargent clones. What  maybe  started as a lighthearted "joke" has grown tiresome, and it's affecting the quality of this board. Perhaps this problem is a bi-product of the relative anonymity of the internet, or maybe I'm overreacting and this isn't a problem at all. Regardless, I believe this needs to be said.   It bothers me that talented writers and boxing enthusiasts like /u/noirargent and /u/youhavethenerve are needlessly and endlessly harassed, simply for being dedicated to making /r/boxing the best boxing forum on the internet. They give us their time, their knowledge, and their talent; as a community we should treasure this valuable resource... I mean fuck, man, /u/effectiveaggression photographed the GGG-Geale weigh in! Shit, do you know how much it costs to hire a photographer? And we got these awesome pictures as a gift to the community. We get to see our god, GGG, for free. I don't even remember if he put watermarks on the damn pictures. And how do we, as a community, express our appreciation? Bullying, harassment, and intimidation. This is not cool, man.   Ha, now this post is the real /r/boxingcirclejerk. But I'm being serious. Not to sound too much like an old man, but I remember when /u/youhavethenerve left the community. I remember how bothered he would become when redditors would refer to fighters as "bums" - because as a person dedicated to the sweet science, he knew how much heart, determination and sacrifice went into being a fighter. This was a person who cared, who contributed so much to this community, and  refused to sell-out this sub to CBS . How did we thank him for doing all of this, at his own expense? The fact that his account was deleted is your answer.   This exchange is from the thread where /u/Hungry_Freaks_Daddy discovered that VICE had plagiarized from his comments.   /u/youhavethenerve:  > "I was once contacted by CBS because they liked my fight previews and wanted to use them in their boxing coverage. They were willing to pay me. I told them they could use them for free provided that they sourced back to this subreddit."   /u/Hungry_Freaks_Daddy:  > "So you turned it down just so you could continue posting them here?"   /u/youhavethenerve:  > "Fuck yea. All I ever wanted was to build a community devoted to boxing. The only way to do that is to consistently create quality content — quality content that would encourage others to create quality content."   VICE stole from a free resource such as /r/boxing. Think about that for a second. CBS was interested in using material from /r/boxing. This speaks volumes about the quality of the contributions to this subreddit made by the community's moderators. And how do we thank these people? Troll accounts, racism-tinged spam comments, and a real lack of respect. We are better than this. This is not cool, man. There is a place for your funny troll posting, it is called /r/boxingcirclejerk. You could also give the ESNEWS comment section a try.   So far, /u/noirargent has had a sense of humor about the whole situation, but I don't want the community to lose him the same way we lost /u/youhavethenerve. That would be  devastating . So, to /u/noirargent, I say - you're a helluva fighter. A helluva fighter. Do what you gotta do to go out there and get the "W" the best way you know how. Ya know, you're facing a real rugged guy, a tough competitor, but you're a young, hungry lion and it's different on this level. You are a true champion.Summary:

Summarize: Like watties12 said, i've already did a [long post about the same subject]( - which was a bit less discussed.   The idea was the same, and people who reacted mostly criticized the fact that a gun could be only unlocked in Single Player as they should never be forced to play it in order to unlock a particular  gun.  I emphasize this because the guns are the core part of the multiplayer, and the idea of having one or several weapons locked to any guy who didn't complete the campaign was just unfair for the people who don't like playing SP. However, they praised the ideas that the rewards should be only cosmetic like weapon camos, soldier and exo skins (please give a Jonathan Irons/Kevin Spacey skin for completing the campaign in Veteran!), and giving double XP was widely accepted (I've also came up with 6 hours) as it would permit Campaign finishers to catch up on the guys who went straight into the Multiplayer.   After, it's a debate between the people who shouldn't get prevented to get their hand on a weapon simply because they don't like playing another part of the game, and the people who consider those unlocks should be deserved and be unlocked in various ways.   I've came up with a simple idea to try to find an agreement between these two types of people: give the Advanced Arsenal pre-order incentive as a reward for completing the campaign (alongside skins, camos and double XP). Those who pre-ordered have it directly. For all the other people, completing the campaign would be required. So everyone can have it, the way to obtain it would be different though.   Another idea was that the guns unlocked in single player would be also unlocked through normal multiplayer gameplay, but they would be unlocked at the final level before prestiging.   Here's mySummary:

Summarize: I know I can't be the only one looking for old country records. I'm mostly interested in Buck Owens and Merle Haggard, but most record stores only seem to have a small amount of 80s pop country or none at all. I went to a record fair a couple of months ago with 20+ vendors and only one had a small box of country. This stuff has to be out there, but I've been to record stores in Nashville even that were mostly rock-centric.   I've got a fair bit of Bluegrass vinyl and strangely I've been able to find that stuff easier than 50s-60s Country. I know there's tons of this stuff on ebay, but it mostly seems to be coming from people who know nothing about records and grading and I've very hesitant about buying from these people.Summary:

Summarize: I feel like any expression is never a cause of immediate concern, but it is something to raise an eyebrow over. It's not that she has wedding magazines, it's that she is Hiding the magazines. Obviously no cause for alarm, but I would certainly watch myself over certain gestures that may get her hopes up over things that are not entirely intentional. Like if you got your kid a car magazine and then took him to a car lot on his 16th birthday only to say, which new car should I get? There is a certain level of dishonesty and let down that may be unintentional but still very real.   I guess my take away for the real world is that: people get divorced and people question how little marriage means, and how nobody takes it seriously. She buys a bridal magazine, and marriage doesn't even matter, it's just a fun hobby to look at. Is a life long commitment a light-hearted subject, or something to take seriously? Because I got a tattoo and my mother still gives me shit after 3 years.Summary:

It is not that she has wedding magazines, it is that she is hiding the magazines. Obviously there is no cause for alarm, but I would certainly take care of certain gestures that can get her hopes about things that are not entirely intentional. As if you got your son a car magazine and then took him to a parking lot on your 16th birthday just to say, what new car should I get? There is a certain level of dishonesty and deception that can be involuntary but still very real. I guess my take away for the real world is that: people get divorced and people question how little marriage means, and how nobody takes it seriously. She buys a bridal magazine, and marriage doesn’t even matter, it’s just a fun hobby to look at. It’s just a long life engagement a light heart issue, or something to take seriously? Because I have a tattoo and my mother still gives me shit after 3 years.
Summarize: In a nutshell, they're trying to re-define the concept of net neutrality as a marketable attribute.   This by itself isn't malicious in nature.  It becomes so when the truth is actually opposite, and they are purposefully shouting (true) but irrelevant facts to distract from the (fact) that what they want is to win regulators' approval in order to purchase Time Warner Cable.   It's a good-will campaign.   The statutes requiring net neutrality (which Comcast  currently  abides by) expire in 2018, and if they are allowed to acquire TWC they will become "too big to fail" (the equivalent of having carte blanche due to an overwhelming legislative influence).   This matters because their vision isn't based on the actual technologies or realities that make something like the Internet possible.  I have no doubt the Internet will persevere, regardless of who wins this argument, however if we're not careful we may end up with a highly-restricted networked equivalent of your cable box where protocols &  standards take a back seat to business logic and a revenue model. (somewhat hyperbolic, but an apt comparison)   If that happens the economic and social consequences would be  significant  and the outcome would favor only Comcast at the expense of the public.   [EDIT] TheSummary:
In short, they try to redefine the concept of net neutrality as a commercial attribute. It's not by nature malicious. That's how the truth is actually opposite, and they deliberately shout (true) but irrelevant facts to distract from the (fact) that they want to get the approval of regulators to buy Time Warner Cable. It's a goodwill campaign. The statutes demanding net neutrality (which Comcast currently respects) expire in 2018, and if they are allowed to acquire TWC, they will become "too big to fail" (the equivalent of having carte blanche due to overwhelming legislative influence). This is important because their vision is not based on real technologies or realities that make possible something like the Internet. I have no doubt that the Internet will persevere, no matter who wins this argument, however if we are not careful, we can end up with a very small network equivalent of your cable box.
In summary, they try to redefine the concept of net neutrality as a marketable attribute. This is not in itself malicious in nature. It becomes so when the truth is actually opposed, and they deliberately (true) but irrelevant facts distract from the (actually) that what they want to gain the approval of regulatory authorities to buy Time Warner Cable. It's a good will campaign. The statutes that net neutrality (the Comcast currently holds) expire in 2018 and if they are allowed to acquire TWC, they will "too big to fail" (the equivalent to have Carte Blanche due to an overwhelming legislative influence). This is important because their vision is not based on the actual technologies or realities that make something like the Internet possible. I have no doubt the Internet will persevere regardless of who wins this argument, but if we are not careful, we can end up with a highly restricted equivalent of your cable box where protocols and standards take back to business logic and a tax model.
Summarize: In short, they are trying to redefine the concept of net neutrality as a marketable attribute. This by itself is not malicious in nature. It becomes so when the truth is really opposite, and they are deliberately shouting (true) but irrelevant facts to distract from (fact) that what they want is to gain the approval of regulators to buy Time Warner Cable. It is a campaign of good will. The statutes that require net neutrality (which Comcast currently maintains) expire in 2018, and if they are allowed to acquire TWC they will become "too big to fail" (the equivalent of having white card due to overwhelming legislative influence).This matters because their vision does not rely on the real technologies or realities that make something like the Internet possible. I have no doubt that the Internet will persevere, regardless of who wins this argument, however if we are not careful we can end up with high legislative pressure.

As far as a source of carbs though, they're great - more protein than grains and stuff, and plenty nutritious. But they aren't a replacement for protein, they're basically a source of carbs that also has a decent amount of protein.Summary:

Summarize: Greetings internet, I got a message from someone on /r/learndota2 about Bristle after I commented on [this]( I decided to post the most useful bits of my advice for a couple of reasons. First, I may have got stuff wrong or missed things so having you guys check it out would be great. Second, Bristle has a ~49.45% winrate in normal skill and that needs to go up, he's really fun to play but no one wants to pick up a hero they're more likely to lose with than win.   When I first picked up Bristle I was probably ~1.5k but this was before ranked was a thing. It takes almost no time at all to get to 2.5k with Bristle because people don't know what to do when you run at them. After that, people have lost enough games to Bristle to know when not to chase in a 5 man conga line hitting your back so he's slightly less effective. I usually play fairly passively until level 4 (1-2-1-0) and brown boots then if I'm vs a dual lane without something like fissure or hex I just jump on the squishiest hero, the carry if possible but not if they have an escape (e.g Anti-Mage or Slark). Most importantly,  don't die , a Bristle that's fallen far behind is just a fairly tanky melee creep. As for being countered by the new items, just carry dust for glimmer/silver edgeand don't be afraid to build a BKB and/or MKB if people build halberd/solar.   Starting:   Easy Lane : Ring of Protection, Tangos, Salve and Mango if I think I'll be able to reach the side shop 54 seconds after the horn or after a couple of last hits, which is when I get Stout Shield then turn RoP into a Basi when possible. Use the extra regen and promise of burst mana to harass the enemy lane with quill sprays and a couple of right clicks if it's safe. At level 4 use the Mango to get full mana pool and go fight something that can't escape easily. 150 burst mana gives 4.2 quill sprays so try to use a few to get a couple of stacks up before committing, be efficient with your mango. You want to have full mana when you go in but try not to waste the burst, it's not cheap. Even if you don't get a kill, you force the enemy to go to base or use all their remaining regen. After you get a kill or zone someone, you have 30 secs to a minute to farm more safely, use that time well. Buy a TP scroll so you can help other lanes, though remember you'll have 75 less mana after using your TP and you're useless without mana at this point. Go for a ring of health if the support(s) are harassing you more than you can handle without regen from Mango/Tango or finish Treads if you're fine without. You'll want to go Stout -> Basi -> Boots of Speed -> TP scroll -> RoH/Treads -> Treads/RoH -> Vanguard in most easy lane games since you usually have the chance to get a quick Crimson Guard and snowball like crazy from there with your team, take a fight and/or tower every 70s because your entire team is basically unkillable for 10 seconds in fights before 25 mins.   Difficult Lane : Ring of Protection, Tangos, Salve and Stout Shield. Go straight into Basi and a ring of health so you have the necessary health/mana regen and armor to secure farm in lane, then get a TP, then Treads so you can kill stuff if the opportunity arises. Depending on the timing of your Treads, how well other lanes are doing and the heroes in the game, you'll either want to complete your Vanguard into Crimson anyway, complete your Vanguard then go for something else like Solar Crest or skip Vanguard entirely and go for that Solar Crest sooner.   Early Game:  I personally like Crimson Guard as a first big item as it makes your entire team negate 30-70% of right-click damage in early fights, as well as the great health regen and armor that it gives you. Otherwise go for Solar Crest, it gives evasion and armor if you need to survive or amplifies your damage and provides miss chance vs an enemy that you want to kill quicker or hits hard (SF, Juggernaut and PA are commonly picked and great targets for Solar Crest). Remember to tread-switch when chasing people down at the end of fights or during pickoffs, you still don't have lots of mana/regen.   Mid Game:  If you went Crimson Guard first and the enemy team has right-click damage, go Solar Crest. If you went straight for Solar Crest, don't bother going back for Crimson, it's only really useful up to ~30 mins. I tend to either go for the AC -> Octarine build or AC -> Heart. Insert BKB after AC if absolutely needed but you generally want to absorb as much damage as possible for more quill procs. Go for Heart if you're going for a right-click build, it gives 40 base damage, massive amounts of raw hp and absurd regen outside of fights. Buy Octarine if you need more sustain in fights and/or your team has someone else with auto-attack damage to cover for you relying more on quills. Please don't go Blademail, Bristle's passive reduces the damage that you take and therefore reduces the damage that blademail does, you're literally countering yourself by levelling your own skills.   Late Game:  After AC and your big regen item, you can get anything you think will help, I played an 70 minute game ages ago where ended the game with 2 hearts, a skadi, a pipe, AC and travel boots so I could tank the entire enemy team and fountain to make space for my PA to go ham and kill everything. That's usually a pretty bad item build as you severely lack damage considering ~25k net worth but in that game it worked really well. In more normal games, generally go for either Shiva's, Abyssal, MKB, Scythe, Octarine/Heart, Skadi or Agh's.  Shiva's  is core if you have a Phoenix or immobile heroes on your team or you're playing vs heroes with low attack speed (e.g Tiny) or high move speed (e.g Luna, Enchantress).  Abyssal  is for if you need to cancel TPs vs rat heroes, you need to right-click harder vs tanky cores such as Sven, you need lockdown on a slippery hero like QoP or you need an instant disable against initiators (e.g Tidehunter). Only get  MKB  vs evasion that's actually hard to deal with. If the enemy PA is starting to snowball, don't hesitate to rush an MKB straight after AC, sometimes even before. If their dazzle bought a Solar Crest and is only using it on himself, don't bother, the evasion isn't damaging your team enough to warrant a 5k+ item when there are better alternatives.  Scythe  is really good, especially if you went Heart over Octarine since you'll likely be slightly lacking on mana regen. It gives a way to cancel TPs and lock down slippery heroes and lasts longer than abyssal, however it doesn't do much for your right-clicks so be aware that you might fall behind in that aspect. Buy  Octarine/Heart  if you think that you need both to survive. You'll have an absurd amount of EHP but very little damage, so make sure your mid and carry do plenty. Get a  Skadi  if you need more stats overall and spend a lot of time right-clicking. In most situations a Shiva's would be better but if you need to slow enemies and you're going for a more auto-attack oriented build, Skadi doesn't have cooldown and it gives slightly better offensive stats in return for significantly less armor and int.  Aghanim's Scepter  is good for dealing with many units so get it vs heroes like Meepo, Nature's Prophet and Spectre, otherwise buy something else, it's outshined by Skadi in terms of overall stats and both Scythe and Abyssal give better slow/stun on an important target. Once you have AC + Octa/Heart + 1, you can sell your Crimson Guard for the last 1500 gold of your next item if it's necessary.     General stuff to know about the game:     Always always always carry a Town Portal scroll until you get Boots of Travel, especially if you're playing against a hero that can towerdive early (e.g. night stalker, bristleback) and you have enough burst/disable to kill them or you have a spell that can save the ally if they go in: people rarely expect a tp response below 3.5k MMR.     If you need to mute your team, do it. If someone's flaming or being an idiot don't let them distract you, they make it hard enough to win as it is.     Practice last hitting in a lobby as your top 5 favourite heroes without buying any items or leveling skills (maybe psi blades on TA for bonus practice), once you can get ~50-70 in 10 mins you can probably outlane anyone below 3k MMR and be competitive above that.     And as you continue towards 8 0 0 0 M A T C H M A K I N G P O I N T S, remember that [this]( applies more than you'd expect.         Quite a bit of maths incoming to explain AC vs Heart so be warned! Anyways, here we go:   I'm going to assume that Bristleback is at level 16 with strength treads, a basi, a Crimson Guard a Solar Crest. That means he has 1707 health, 18 armor, 25% evasion, hits for 98 damage per hit and attacks 0.98 times per second (used  this . This comes to 4734 physical EHP vs auto-attacks from the front, 7890 physical EHP vs auto-attacks from behind and 96 damage per second. Spamming spells and constantly attacking over 7 seconds, have an average of 4 stacks of warpath. That changes your damage to 218 per hit and 214 per second.   Now I'm going to show what happens if you add a Heart or an AC to that, since you should be finishing either one around level 15-18 if you're going for it after Crimson and Solar, depending on the game:     With a heart, you have 2767 health and deal 258 damage per hit but the same attack speed, evasion and armor. That means you have  6751  EHP vs auto attacks from the front,  10330  EHP vs auto-attacks from behind and you deal  253  damage per second.     With an AC, you have 33 armor and hit 1.27 times per second but the same health, evasion and damage per hit. That means you have  6782  EHP vs auto-attacks from the front,  11304  EHP vs auto-attacks from behind and you deal  277  damage per second. Also bear in mind that with a 'low health + high armor' build, flat heals restore more of your EHP (Omniknight's Purification heals for 13% of your health with the heart build, 21% with the AC build). This is doubly important for Bristle because if you go for Octarine Core, the heals from quill spray are flat, not percentage-based. AC also amplifies your team's damage per second and the damage you deal with quill spray and has an easier build-up and it weakens towers and Roshan. Wow, surprised myself there with some of that, AC is really good... The only real benefit to heart is that, since you have more health, you have more free quill sprays in teamfights but I don't like relying on the enemy team for my to deal damage.       Also, Sange and Yasha is a potential item, get it after Crimson Guard and/or Solar Crest and before AC if you're going for it. The move/attack speed and maim are really useful since you don't have a positioning spell, and the bonus strength+agility give you a nice health, damage and attack speed boost. Go for it if you're not desperate for armor (i.e no one picked Slardar/TA or is rushing deso on enemy team) and you started relatively well.  Here . Also, get BKB before AC once you get to high-skill, people start chaining stuns/silences pretty well and you'll likely need it sooner if you get it at all.     Sorry for text wall, here's theSummary:

Summarize: He's 25 and I'm 20f. We've been together almost a year and for the past couple of months we've had an on-off relationship. Until a few months ago he was an amazing boyfriend, seemed happy with me but he would often confide in me how he felt stuck in a rut of just working a dead-end job and not bettering himself. I've always tried to just listen, and encourage him. Just generally be as supportive as I could be.   Now he goes back and forth a lot, he'll say he loves me and wants to be with me and make things work, we'll get back together and things will be great for a while until he eventually starts acting very apathetic; he seems uninterested in pretty much everything, it's like nothing really makes him happy anymore and he starts neglecting our relationship which leads to another break up. He recently quit his job without even having another one lined up. When I asked why he quit, he had no reason at all. He said he just didn't want to work there anymore. He hasn't been applying for jobs at all, he doesn't go to school and he's moving back into his parents' house next week. Now he just sleeps until the late afternoon and plays video games. He's been neglecting his friendships as well. The last time we saw each other, we got into an argument and he broke up with me. He said he didn't want to 'deal' with anything anymore, he's sick of being stressed. He got really angry with me and told me he didn't want to hear from me again. I told him not to say something he couldn't take back, he apologized and told me to just give him some time to himself. He was still really mad and it's pretty clear he doesn't want to speak to me for a while.   I really think he's either depressed or bipolar. I could be wrong, maybe I'm just trying to find a reason why he's given up on us... I don't know. I know I should just leave him alone, I just need some support and maybe some advice? Has anyone else been in this kind of situation? Does he sound depressed or did he just fall out of love or something? I've asked him numerous times why he keeps alternating between being an awesome bf to a shitty bf and he says he honestly doesn't know. I've frequently asked point-blank if he just isn't that into me or if he just doesn't want a relationship and he promises that he loves me and is very into me, and wants to be with me etc... But then he neglects the relationship and one of us ends up breaking it off again. I've told him over and over again that if he just isn't in love with me anymore to tell me and he still insists that that isn't it and that he doesn't know what's wrong with him but he does want to try and he 'absolutely' wants to be with me and treat me the way I deserve. I've also asked him before if he thinks he's depressed and he kinda got defensive and said he probably is before he changed the subject and told me to drop it. Depression also runs in his family, and one of his close relatives had severe depression and committed suicide a couple years ago.   I feel crazy, I know I should walk away but I love him very much and I'm so worried about him. Even if we're not together I want to be there for him if he really has some kind of disorder or depression... now I'm just rambling... Anyone have any advice?Summary:

Summarize: I took a class in University on Humor which may help answer your question?   The question really first is why are you laughing, what makes it funny. There are few theories on the different types: superiority (laughing at someone), incongruity (laughing because your surprised), and one for self-reflected humor (putting oneself down -- maybe defensive).   My mother said she would always come up with the deeming names she was assigned in school because she believed using this, often mitigated much of the offense. Similarly the wiki article mentions this as a potential defense mechanism.   However, most people think the simplest form of laughter is a reflexive like being tickled.  Often some of the greatest laughs in a comedy show come from a reflex line. The comedian builds up a joke around half way through the show and gets a good laugh. He will then find a way to tie the punchline back into his closing joke. By doing this, he basically taps into this reflexive nature and often the second laugh is often more emphatic (going out with a bang).Summary:

Summarize: One night I saw something weird.   I was in bed at about 12 midnight. There are some windows right beside my bed and they were open. I was lying in bed and gazing at the sky. I love the night sky. Soon, I saw a humanoid like figure slowly flying left to right in a direction slightly inclined upwards from the horizontal.   I was surprised at first so I looked very carefully at it. It was black most probably and I could clearly see its outline since the sky was not that dark that night.   It looked vertically longer, like a human but with a slightly irregular shape. It was pretty close to my window, like 100 meter or so (or maybe farther away but that's what it seemed).   The weirdest part of it is that it was moving with a highly uniform speed. Like no acceleration, uniform speed and in a straight line (thus more like uniform velocity).   I stared at it for a few seconds and realized it's not something Normal. I quickly looked away because I didn't want eye contact.   I was thinking what I should do and I feared it might come for me because I've seen it. I woke my parents up and told them what I saw. Cuz if they'd find me dead in the morning they'd atleast know what happened. I went back to sleep. Haven't seen it since.   Description -  it was humanoid like, vertically longer, upright. Was flying in the sky with an abnormally uniform velocity. It was about the size of a human albeit bigger. It kind of looked like the shape a witch sitting on a broom would have.  I know this sounds ridiculous but I fucking saw exactly what I ve said here.Summary:
Summarize: So I've never been in a relationship. Straight 26 year old European male, living in one of the largest cities in North America.   I'm halfway through a Ph.D in a theoretical science. I'm in great shape, I'm 6 foot 1, dress well, have been told by women that I'm very attractive. I play two instruments. I speak four languages. I practice a martial art. I love to cook and am quite good at it. I can hold a conversation easily, and smile often. I even garden (have a small place of my own with a tiny garden in front of it). I occasionally travel.

Almost all of these things are things that I've done in the past several years in order to improve myself so that I could finally stop being alone. "Become someone who people want to be around." Well it hasn't worked. My loneliness is getting to the point of causing physical pain and other symptoms (consistent with clinical depression). If I can't find someone while mentally healthy, I can't imagine ever doing so while clinically depressed. But I just don't know what I can do.   The social trend in this city seems to be insular cliques. People don't really talk socially with strangers. Even at bars and parties people go in groups or pairs, and I feel extremely out of place being by myself with no other individuals there. When joining activity groups I have no issue forming superficial connections with people and getting along well for the purposes of that activity, but no one really takes much of an interest in me. I've asked some women out in case I was simply bad at reading romantic interest, but have been rejected every time. I've never been on a date.   I've tried online dating, but that was a soul-crushing experience in which I got tons of profile views, but no messages and no responses to any of my messages.   The amount of effort this requires is considerable, and the constant failure is starting to take its toll on my research and my health.Summary:

Summarize: When I was about 15, my family had two large rottweilers, both probably about 100lbs, they got out of the fence, so my father and I went looking for them. They're the most harmless dogs that I've owned, we find them being chased by a neighbor with a revolver in his hand, and the dogs are walking towards us like, 'this guy doesn't want to play..' They were just exploring the neighborhood... and this looney toon comes walking up to use with a gun in his hand, now I would understand if they bit someone, or scared someone, but they just kept away from people and wanted to see what was outside of their fence.Summary:

Summarize: Here's my original post:   "I expect to get blow up on all sides for this, but I need perspective so here goes. Been with my husband 3 1/2 years, married for 1. We have a baby together. He has been physically abusive in the past and has alcohol and anger problems. I have many issues from past relationships being abusive and this has made things harder to work through.   I go to personal counseling and we go to marital counseling. They both go well but my problem is this, I don't feel anything towards my husband anymore. I don't want to kiss, cuddle, having sex is out of the question. He has complained that I never say I love him. I do feel love FOR him, but not like I'm in love.   I know that marriage isn't all butterflies and rainbows, but shouldn't I feel ...more? I've asked him to be more romantic or just think of me in day to day activites but it seems from my side he just lives his life and I go along with it, not a partnership.   We recently separated for a while, we both were unfaithful. I slept with an old flame from school and he had sex with 4 girls. He's devastated about what I did because he's worried I have feelings for the guy ( I don't ) but honestly I wasn't even that upset about what he did. I feel broken and I don't know how to proceed or if I should give up. He deserves someone who's good for him and loves him.   I asked my therapist for advice and she said to set myself a time period. If I still feel this way at the end of that to leave. She also said to keep marital counseling going. I'm just scared and frustrated and sick of my indifference to him."   So basically, I was hoping to get some advice on how to rekindle any feelings for my husband. We've both made mistakes, we both want to work on things, but I just don't feel like my heart is in it anymore. To quote my original post, I feel love for him, but not like I'm in love with him.   I don't want him to kiss or touch me, I never want to initiate. Sex is out of the question. It just makes my skin crawl and I want it to be over. There are occasions in the last 6 months it has happened and been okay, but very rarely. I want to fix myself so we can both be happy in this relationship but I don't know how.   I have set the time limit mentioned above, and if I stick to it I'm supposed to leave Sept. 14th if I still feel this way. I'm panicking because it's just flying by and I don't feel anything changing. We haven't been able to make marital counseling appointments and that's the only thing I was told may help. Any advice is appreciated.Summary:

Summarize: Warning: LONG!   My father had remarried and they had two sons (my half brothers).  One day in early January a few weeks before my fourth birthday, my father decided to take me for a ride.  I remember being really excited as spending time with just the two of us didn't happen very often.  We rode along in his beat-up white station wagon (the kind with imitation wood panels along the outside) and counted snowflakes as they landed on the windshield.  At one point, my father says that he has to stop at an office to discuss business with someone.  We arrive at the office building and spend an excruciating amount of time talking to a man behind a large desk.  The man behind the desk gave me a tray of magnets shaped like stick-figures to play with.  After a while, my father mentioned that he was thirsty and asked if I wanted a soda.  I requested a root beer.  While he was gone, the man behind the desk started asking me questions.  After a while had passed and my father hadn't come back, I began to get quite upset.  I don't remember how I made it to the entryway of the office building.  Maybe I got up and ran there, maybe the guy behind the desk took me there to calm me down; but when I got there, the white station wagon was gone.  The man led me back inside and introduced me to my caseworker who informed me that I had been placed up for adoption.  I spent my fourth birthday in a foster home.   I was eventually adopted by my aunt and uncle on my father's side (my father's sister and her husband).  They provided a very loving home and it was never a secret that I was adopted.  I still saw my father and his family once or twice a year, especially on holidays.   I never thought that it actually bothered me until I was in my early 20's.  A lot of memories came flooding back around that time, the most prominent one being how his new wife had given him an ultimatum:  either I left or she was leaving with his two other sons.  We are all quite a bit older now.  At a funeral for one of my other close relatives, we (his wife and I, then my father and I) sat down and confronted all of the feelings that we'd kept bottled up.  I think that it has really taken its toll on him over the years.  I can't imagine being forced to make that decision.  I knew something was up when one of my half brothers came alone to visit when I was in my early 20's.  "If we're brothers, how is it that you're not with us?"  Apparently the story was a bit more taboo on their side of the family.   The experience has had a profound effect on how I view relationships.  In my early relationships I would pretty much do anything to please the girl I was with.  Maybe I was trying to please that mother figure that delivered the final ultimatum.  Maybe I was just scared of being alone again.  I also used to subconsciously sabotage relationships because “nobody sticks around forever”.  I’ve pretty much gotten over a lot of that, but I realize that some things are ingrained and work to understand where my feelings are really coming from.  I hold no resentment towards my biological father or his family, never did.  We have all forgiven the past and I'm very thankful that I still have them in my life.   Never did get that root beer, though :/Summary:

Summarize: It was the name of someone I was sorta dating, which is strange. My internet friend asked me what my name was and it was the first thing I could come up with - and it stuck. I also told her my "last" name, which happened to belong to this other person I had feelings for.Summary:

Summarize: The current campaign my group is going through is run by two dm's and while it is an intriguing story line thy benefits from the two o them colaborating. As a player I find my self wishing I had another player over a second dm, most of the time. So, while it has it's perks I think solo dming is the way to go. If you are set on using the dm method the duties are split with combat along the lines of stat keeping (health and status ailments) and movement and strategy of the monsters. For the story line they collaborate for the most part trading off acting out various NPC's and narrating different parts of the story.Summary:
Summarize: I've been doing nofap on and off for quite some time now. Every time I do it I feel so much better but I didn't really understand why. This week I sort of had an epiphany on why it is so effective. Basically, I realized that everything you do is a habit.   For me personally, the times I most want to fap are before bedtime and during times of anxiety such as overwhelming social situations or when studying for a big test. Since I had two massive midterms this week, you could imagine I've been fighting the urge quite a bit.   But I did not fap.   Because I realized something: fapping is the easy way out. If I fap when I become anxious I am only cramming that anxiety into a crowded shelf with my other insecurities until it inevitably falls back off the shelf. It's a temporary fix.   If I fap everytime I go to bed, it is the same idea: i'm conditioning my body to only be able to sleep if I get off.   But I did not fap.   Sure I lost some sleep and I became a little more neurotic than usual, but by accepting the hardships that came with it I realized that there is and empowering and refreshing feeling that comes with being able to control yourself. Accept that it sucks, understand why it sucks, and make the decision to  revel in your suffering   Without challenge, there is no growth. This applies to so many things in life! If your workouts aren't hard enough, you wont see results. If you're not studying hard enough, you wont get the good grade. If you don't make the conscious effort to change, no change will happen. Smooth seas do not make a skillful sailor.   In hindsight this seems like such a simple concept but experiencing this for yourself is something else. It really made NoFap easier for me. Instead of distracting yourself with other activities so you don't fap or taking a cold shower ( not saying these are bad alternatives, just presenting another option) try and face your urges head on. It is enlightening when you can tell yourself "I know this sucks. I really want to fap right now because __ ". It allows you to understand the true root of the problem, and in this realization will come more creative solutions along with that empowering sense of "yes I do have control over myself".   Sorry for the long post, thank you to all who read it. Just thought I'd share a little of my thought process with you guys in hopes that it is helpful.Summary:

Since I had two massive midterms this week, one might imagine that I'm falling back the urge quite a bit. It's a temporary solution. If I root every time I'm fap many lives, it's the same idea when I'm scared I'm just this fear in an overcrowded shelf with my other uncertainties until it inevitably falls back from the shelf.
Summarize: Disclosure: I'm one of the primary coders behind SynGaming and because I work behind the scenes I have no idea what actually happened here   Phin can be quick to anger because of the sheer amount of players he deals with on a day to day basis. I actually couldn't handle it myself and dropped down from admin after only a day of dealing with the stuff they have to deal with.That's pretty much the only defense I have for someone  cursing  at you, which I'm entirely surprised that one of the admins would do that.   I can tell you that all of our donation packages we use to keep the servers running were all discussed at length and voted on by the entire community before the Avalon server was created. Days of thought and prep by dozens of people went into the Avalon servers donation process alone.   In addition to Avalon server we also run Camelot server. That one does not have donation packages and is actually older then Avalon. The donation packages were presented as a solution to the fact that we were running out of money to keep our servers online and voluntary player donations weren't meeting server costs. I can attest that 100% of the money is being used to keep the servers online and none of it is being pocketed by any of the admins or founders of Syngaming.   The reason players may of been ganging up on you is because most of them have had this discussion a million times. There's no reason to argue it anymore. We offer a server that does not have donation packages if anyone has a problem with them. With 792 unique logins on Avalon since creation (20 days ago) you can imagine we get a lot of new players who don't like this or don't like that. I know we try our best to help each and ever player that walks through our gates, and Phin / Carrot do a hell of a job, but it's hard to make that many people all happy.Summary:

Summarize: If you're looking for another game like Phoenix Wright, namely heavy narration, murder investigation, courtroom setting, presenting evidence, naming culprits, and finding contradictions, a Japanese PSP game called [Dangan-Ronpa]( just recently got a [translation patch](   The game can be described as a cross between Phoenix Wright and Battle Royale (999 would work too). The basic premise is that for some unknown reason, 15 high school students have been sealed inside Hope Academy. They all woke up inside the school unconscious at their desks. They find that all the windows have been boarded shut, and the front door sealed. They are told by the headmaster, [Monokuma]( that they have the choice of either living in the school indefinitely, or "graduating". In order for a student to "graduate", they must murder another student. After the murder is discovered, students are free to investigate, and a Class Trial is held. The remaining students must determine who the killer is. If they pick correctly, the killer is executed. Otherwise, everyone except the true killer is executed, and the killer is free to leave. The investigations and trial play out very much like Phoenix Wright, and there's a much larger continuous story to all these murders and trials.Summary:

Summarize: my friend comes up to me this morning looking pretty scared and he tells me about his weekend: so what happened was he smoked two joints without feeling anything (sh*t hits slowly ) then he ate two , by this time i give myself a forehead palm because i know what he has gotten himself into , so because he didnt feel anything he slammed back 10 shots of vodka and waited for it to kick in ( he just ate dinner before hand) and it starts kicking in at 12 where he promptly passes out , when he woke up he was WASTED he told me he could barely move and thought he was dying ( i was pissing myself laughing) and vomited twice , tthis lasted the entire day where he was trying to act normal on a 8/10 high with a low tolerance and hes having a bad tripSummary:
Summarize: I have an interview lined up with a company which I basically have zero desire to work for but I am at the end of my rope with my current job. I only planned to be here 6 months and it's been over 3 years. I'm not getting anywhere and my experience here doesn't seem to be landing me any new jobs. I'm not learning anything new.   This new position would allow me to get slightly more experience than my current position. The pay is also ever so slightly more but would get eaten up by travel expenses and city wage tax. I might actually end up making less and money is a real issue right now. So all I have going for me is that little bit of extra experience, however, if I continue to apply for jobs as soon as I get this one, that experience won't really help me, will it?   I mean, if I apply to other jobs right away, I can;t really use that experience yet because I will not have learned how to do those things. Should I even put the new job on my resume?  I can just imagine the questions from future future employers:   How long have you worked in your current position   2 weeks   click   So I am not sure if I am just making more work for myself by transitioning to another job and if there will be some actual benefit to it.Summary:

Summarize: Let me start off by stating: I am a Republican. But my conservatism goes only as far as the economic policy and the ideology of government who only steps in when laws are broken.  I dont agree with how many republicans justify their political stances with religious ideas. For example, I am against gay marriage, just because I personally feel like it is wrong. This does not mean that I would do anything against those who are gay. Some republicans are against gay marriage because they say the Bible says it is wrong. Basing laws off Biblical morals I think is a violation of the separation of church and state which I feel alienates many people who might support the pure political aspect of conservatism but are held back the idea of legislated morality. This is not meant to be inflammatory, I am just stating what I think. If you feel that I am wrong, please let me know why. I would like this to be civilized and not reiterate the ass raping I got when I challenged someones ideas in /r/liberal.Summary:
Summarize: A static contrast ratio is the ratio of the luminosity of the brightest and darkest colours  at any given instance of time  (i.e. for each frame of an image).   Dynamic contrast ratio is the ratio of the luminosity of the brightest and darkest colours the system can produce over a period of time; for instance if you had an almost white image and sometime later an almost black image.   As such, they can't be "converted" per se.   Dynamic contrasting works by lowering the power of the backlight on the TV making the whole image darker but simultaneously amplifying the few pixels which should be coloured/bright. This means it can adjust based on how dark the overall image is allowing you to see dark scenes better. But, the limit on how well you can see those scenes is the static contrast ratio; the system obviously can't do any better than this.   What you really want is a system with a solid static contrast ratio; this gives you a good range of brightness for each image. If it has a dynamic contrast set-up as well, even better, but a TV with incredible DCR and poor SCR will still be difficult to make out dark scenes on.Summary:

Summarize: It, for example, is much harder for me to demonstrate that there are no fairies under my garden than if there were.   YES. You're starting to understand the scientific method.   You can be skeptical. You can be privately judgemental and ridicule that theory, but as a scientist you can NEVER say there aren't fairies under your garden unless you have evidence that contradicts.   I know it's difficult to understand, but not only is it hard for the scientific method to prove a negative, but it's also not the goal of the scientific method to do so.   Science is a method of modelling the world - the best we have. Those models however AREN'T the world - they're just the model we use to base our predictions. The model has been revised from the ground up several times so far and will be revised many times more.   Yes you have a burden of proof to demonstrate the existence of your fairies, and I am able to (scientifically) model the statistical likelihood of this, based upon our evidence, of being less than 0.00000000000000000000000000000000000001% but I cannot, as a scientist, ever be certain of this.   So a BASELINE for scientific reasoning is agnosticism. That would be the first thing to learn.   The second would be that complex systems have complex results that cannot be modeled by simple models. An example is the human body. We can establish certain specific effects from certain specific additives. We can do decade long time trials to confirm or deny our SUSPICIONS that something has no noticable effect, but we KNOW that every change to a complex system has a complex result. EVERY ONE.   So your 'model' of the human body - the one where fluoride goes in, and good teeth come out does NOT accurately model the system. It's a scientifically incomplete model. We know for example that the additition of fluoride or any other accumulative chemical has an effect, both 'positive' and 'negative' to the longevity of that system. We've picked ONE data point - teeth, and we're running with it.   We know (for example) that fluoride accumulates in bones and causes fluorosis. Now your argument might be "it's not statistically significant" and the reason that is scientifically UNSOUND reasoning is because it fails to accurately model the complex system. (as all reductionist reasoning does)   If I change one factor in that - age span - you're made to look like a fool. Suddenly your "statistically insignificant" data point becomes deeply significant.   The interesting thing about fluoride in the human body (and indeed ANY complex system) is that these data points that you and other reductionists choose to acknowledge change constantly - across populations, allergic tolerances, age spans, body sizes, accidental over-fluoridation, species swaps or any other data point you want to call out.

I have smoked one in a basement before but it was already filled up with smoke so I couldn't really tell how bad the blunt smelled. I live with my parents who are cool with me smoking, but I don't want the smell to leave the room- is that possible? Also it's not like I  have  to do it in my room, but if it's possible that would be a good thing to know. I've smoked with a gravity bong in my room before no problem. Also, does the tobacco make a difference in smell? Because the bathroom is kinda the designated smoke spot but if it smells worse I don't want to fuck it up. I guess that's it,Summary:

Summarize: For the longest time, I've been "Only 2D Metroid. They're the only ones I can play." and I've no idea why. I've played through all the 2D games countless times and love them all, but I have this nagging guilt in the back of my mind, that I'm neglecting amazing games, but I can't get into them. This has been going on for  years . Then Federation Force came out and I gave it a try, mostly because I wanted to support the series and I actually loved it. Since beating FF, I've wanted to return to Prime, but haven't gotten around to it.  However  there's one problem I have with this. I absolutely, with unexplained and unbridled rage, fucking  hate  motion controls. I have a feeling I'll love Prime 1, because I have it on Gamecube. The other two games however, I'd need to buy the trilogy for on the eshop, and I'm left with no choice, trilogy or not, but to use that loathsome cunt of a nunchuck.  What do I do? Grin and bear it or what? Because I definitely want to play the series.Summary:

Summarize: The only way to properly balance the gladiator for star citizen is to dump it into AC and then start balancing. It is far better to live with an unbalanced situation in this game now than to hold off and have a better AC experience now but then have to wait through the balance period later after release.   As for balancing they have lots of things that they can tweak on to keep it from being a kill all. Improve countermeasures, tweak how missiles work so you can then say here is  a guide to how you can improve your piloting skills to avoid missiles, void armor could be set to where its very difficult to get a missile lock on a ship that has it, etc.   It may just be me but I don't see arena commander as a game. It is however a game's test bed. I thought the entire point of its existence was so they could introduce new game elements such as the gladiator, have the community test it out and find out if the new game element is over powered, why its over powered, and even go on the forums and talk to the developers about how it could be balanced and what we think would make it better. They can then see the impact, and have a wealth of accumulated community knowledge to then fix any problems.Summary:

Summarize: Due to my bad back and fear of getting hurt I've not done much rolling since starting BJJ. It's really picked up now and I'm rolling a lot and I've come up against moral dilemma of sorts. A lot of the other white belts I'll roll with have very limited rolling experience or haven't been training as long as I have. The problem is that I get torn between wanting to talk them through things while rolling and wanting to practice my own game.   I know that as a white belt I shouldn't be coaching other students, but these instances I'm talking about are more like the other person asking me how I did something, or 'what you would do form here' etc. Any suggestions for this? I want to help them, but I've also reached a point where I want to shut up and roll and practice.Summary:

Summarize: I agree with adding some more depth than that. Getting some of this drama in is fine. But I feel they have lost sight of what made Suits Suits.   I think it's good they dont stick to the same pattern, it makes show become boring (look at House M.D. 80% of most episodes were pretty much the exact same build-up, despite being awesome, it got pretty annoying).   But this shit's getting old, and it's only gonna get worse, I think. I'm certain Mike will break up after Rachel tells him (next ep probably), and after that Mikes probably gonna end up in some miserable slump. Maybe starts smoking weed again or something, to underline the obvious rockbottom he's hit. Rachel's probably gonna seek council with Donna, who will advise her to "give him some time" or something like that. And I think they will drag this "will they get back together or won't they?" on for a longer while than needed. And they might even decide to make it worse, because collusion happens with two people. Why not also force Harvey to patch up the broken Mike because Cahill is riding their ass with his personal vendetta, and he can't have Mike being an easy way into his bussiness in his current state.Summary:

Summarize: A little past first: we have already split up some 6 years ago since I was head on depressed, didn't have any friends, job, hobbies or real purpose in life. Just lived for my family.   This just proved to much for her and we split up. In the months that followed I really took the "delete lawyer, gym up, go to the facebook" mantra and was in a way reborn. My whole life lit up, made tons of friends, hooked up with a lot of women, made good money doing several different jobs. Became happy.   Couple of years later we got together again, with a new perspective on life, things started going great.   Heres where it gets weird, every couple of days, maybe once a week, I tell her that I need to be alone. Just chill in my old appartment, play some Witcher, eat pizza on the bed. I guess normal stuff right? I always end up happier when I do this, like its a bit of sacred time to collect my thoughts and move forward.   She HATES this, I mean seriously, everytime I leave she makes up a fight out of thin air that ends up being awful, and horrible things are said.   As I was leaving today for my week's "me" time she yelled that If I left we would be over as a relationship, now I hate being manipulated through ultimatums so I left anyway.   I wanted a sanity check though... am I being selfish? I thought alone time was something like a psychological necessity, at least for me it feels like it, I get irritable and in a general bad mood if I can't find some space.Summary:
I didn't have any friends, work, hobbies or real purpose in life. I lived for my family. It made a lot of proof for her and I can split up.

Summarize: I'm really flat chested so much so I can get away with no bra as my boobs practically don't exist and I love it.   I am  not  flat-chested, but sometimes I actually wish that I were  more  flat-chested just so that I could feel more comfortable in my own skin.Summary:
Summarize: I work as a Fire Safety Director. It tends to cost a lot of money to bring old buildings up to Fire Code or just make any building up to Fire Code if they haven't been maintained or built properly. So to cut costs a lot of Management companies either ignore the issue or complies with the absolute minimum in order to prolong the expenditure of money for upgrades. Also tenants of said buildings sometimes (with enough money) have their floors or areas filled with fire hazards but pay a lot so a blind eye is turned. Ex. Emergency exit stairwell exists on paper but in actuality it is enclosed and turned into a private stairwell for that companies floor.Summary:
Summarize: My boyfriend has been very distant lately, which made me stress about our relationship [7 months] and whether or not he still wants to be in it.   I confronted him about this, admittedly being a little more blunt than I could have been. He responded saying he was sorry, and that he was having a rough week due to hearing some bad news. I told him I'd back off and give him some space, and I'd be right here waiting for him when he's ready. That was the end of the conversation.   On one hand, I feel awful for being so blunt with him while under emotional distress, but, on the other hand, I wasn't to know (and I still don't; he hasn't told me anything).   While I understand that it could be a private matter that he doesn't want to discuss with me, I feel disappointed that he didn't come to me for emotional support, which meant our tensions have escalated into this uncomfortable situation.   This is the first time we've been tense, so I don't have precedent for insight.Summary:
Summarize: BACKGROUND:   I've been friends with Shirley since middle school. She moved to my city about 1.5 years ago and we started spending loads of time together. I don't have many friends, but the ones I do have are very intimate and important to me...i'm very open with them and consider them family.   I've been in a relationship with John for 5 yrs (except a brief period where we broke up, distance is hard guys) and we've been non-monogamous for the past 2 since he moved to another country for school/work. John is my primary partner and best friend (and I plan to move to his country next year), but I usually have one or sometimes 2 casual dating relationships with guys that I really enjoy as people. He knows this and I know about (and support!) the women he spends time with. I don't push non-monogamy on other people, I know its unorthodox and not for everyone, but it works for us. Shirley has known about the open relationship the whole time and was one of only 3 people I ever talk to about it.   THE FRIEND BREAK-UP:   I tend to date other people in open relationships because its just easier to not have to tiptoe around it and they're better at sticking to boundaries. I recently started seeing a pretty great 28M who is in an open marriage (which I confirmed directly w the wife). I was hanging out with Shirley one night and mentioned that I had just been to this new bar she was talking about. She asked who with so I told her. She creeped him on my Facebook and found out that he's married, which she said was weird but seemed lighthearted and we changed topics.   Out of the blue 3 days later I get a 5 paragraph email from her about how she can no longer be friends with me because my personal life causes her "physical pain" and she needs to surround herself with like-minded people. She equated it to infidelity (alluded to some cheating that happened in her family) and essentially called me a home-wrecking whore. Said i'm naive and she didn't believe he's really in an open relationship, that I have low morals, and was just overall very judgmental. Since done via email, I didn't get to defend myself. I've actually met the wife and talked to them both about rules and boundaries, but she didn't know that because she sent this nasty-gram without ever talking to me about it face to face.   After weeks of no contact, she texted me wanting to talk. Offers no hints at apology, says she's not changing her mind about whats right and wrong but hopes that "we" can fix this. I don't think our friendship can return to the closeness we once shared after so much bitter judgement...I want to be able to be myself around my closest friends and feel supported by them. However, i'm not sure I should walk away from someone who i've known for almost half my life.   What do I do? Let the friendship die or meet up with her to 'talk'? Any insight as to why she might be freaking out like this would also be welcomed.Summary:

Summarize: This is what I anticipate happening: QE3 will compete with REITS in buying mortgages, this will drive up prices of MBS increasing book value of REITS. REITS will need to have more share offerings to raise capital to buy these higher priced MBS.   However, due to operation twist and the flattening of the yield spread, REITS will make less money... unless they go to higher leverage.   Profit wise, they either will have the same earnings (aggressive REITS who increase leverage) or less earnings (less agressive REITS). These earnings (at the same level, or less) are now distributed between MORE SHARES per above... thus, dividends will necessarily come down. Also, because of the higher book value, assuming share prices go up to keep up with the NAV of the underlying, the dividend YIELD will drop. When the announcements of dividend cuts come, they MIGHT bring down share prices (depends on how desperate the market is for yield). Won't happen immediately... I give it 18 months.  (Several REITS have announced dividend cuts in the past month, will be interesting to see if there will be anymore)Summary:
Summarize: A little about me: I'm 35, work professionally, own my own home, etc. I've always been somewhat "high strung," but have been able to manage my inner-stresses for the most part. I'm pretty active. I get about fairly regularly, and work out 5 or 6 days a week, which I've always found to be relaxing.   Last Wednesday, I was lifting at the gym - nothing particularly heavy - but at the end of my set, I started to get tunnel vision, felt extremely dizzy, and my extremities started tingling. I immediately grabbed my water bottle and sat on a couch stationed near the locker room. When the dizziness didn't go away after 10 minutes, then 20 minutes, I began to worry. I had to call my girlfriend and ask her to leave work to get me and take me to an urgent care facility. It took around 2 hours to see a doctor, and by that time, I had finally calmed down quite a bit. They ran a series of tests (blood pressure, hooked me up to an EKG, took my blood - which later came back as normal), but never found anything. I chalked it up to "something I ate" and set out to go about my normal life.   The next morning, I got up as I normally would and started my normal route to work, which is about 20 minutes and about half highway driving. As soon as I got on the highway, I started to get anxious. I was feeling dizzy, felt like I was gasping for air, and I could feel my heart pounding through the top of my skull and ears. I immediately got off the highway at the first exit and decided it would be best to stick to the side streets. I was still anxious, but not like I was on the highway.   Thursday and Friday, I thought I'd best take the surface roads to work, thinking about what happened on the highway. I resigned myself to rest HARD over the weekend, and hopefully get everything out of my system. I didn't leave the house except to take my dogs for runs. This morning, I could feel my stress rising as it came time to drive to work. Sure enough, I felt extremely anxious the whole way, but not to the point of "panic" as I'd experienced before. I kept telling myself throughout the day that whatever was going on was all in my head and that I'd be fine by the time I had to drive home. When I left work, I felt mostly fine. Until I entered the highway. I tried to fight the anxiety, but it came on stronger and stronger the longer I was on the highway. Finally, it came to the point where I had to either pull over entirely or go another couple of exits until mine. I kept going and made it to my exit. As soon as I pulled off the highway, I felt a little better. The rest of the drive home was stressful, but again, not "panic" level.   I'm honestly completely lost here and don't know what to do. I've never dealt with this before, so I don't know if I should just rest a couple of more days? See a doctor? (If so, what kind?) Keep making myself drive despite feeling like I'm going to freak out/die/whatever - or worse - hurt myself or someone else by losing control of my vehicle? Any advice would be sincerely appreciated. I'm absolutely beside myself.Summary:
I've always been a bit "at close range", but I've been able to manage my internal stress for the most part. I'm quite active.

Last Wednesday, I got up in the gym - nothing particularly heavy - but at the end of my set, I started to have a vision of the tunnel, I felt dizzy, and my extremities started to tingle.

Summarize: When you are on birth control, you don't have normal periods - you have a withdrawal bleed caused by a dip in hormones. Hormones, particularly estrogen, can be stored in fat. So if you have been on birth control, your body has likely stored away excess hormones in your fat cells. Now that you are losing weight, your body is breaking down fat cells and using them for energy, thereby metabolizing the stored hormones and keeping your body from having a noticeable enough drop in hormones to keep you from having a withdrawal bleed.Summary:
Summary: When you are under birth control, you do not have normal rules - you have withdrawal bleeding caused by a dip in hormones. Hormones, especially estrogen, can be stored in fat. So, if you have been under birth control, your body has probably stored the excess hormones in your fat cells. Now that you are losing weight, your body is decomposing fat cells and using them for energy, thus metabolizing stored hormones and preventing your body from having a sufficiently noticeable decrease in hormones to prevent you from having withdrawal bleeding.
Summary: If you are on birth control, you have no normal periods - you have a withdrawal bleeding caused by a bath in hormones. Hormones, especially estrogen, can be stored in fat. So if you have been on birth control, your body has probably stored excess hormones in your fat cells. Now that you lose weight, your body breaks fat cells and with them for energy, thereby metabolizing the stored hormones and keeping your body from a noticeable drop in hormones to keep you from bleeding from withdrawal.
Summarize: When you are in birth control, you do not have normal periods - you have a withdrawal bleed caused by a fall in hormones. Hormones, particularly estrogen, can be stored in fat.

Summarize: I had spinal surgery last week.  I had a follow up appointment today with my neurosurgeon and asked him about the surgery.  In his opinion, Tiger will never be the same.  A golf swing - especially how Tiger swings - is violent.

Summarize: Hey Fantasy Writers. I'm in the plotting stages of a Fantasy/Steam-Punk series. While I haven't quite figured out yet how lengthy I want each instalment to be, it's the beginning that I am getting a little worried about, in particular the first book that I started outlining.   The overall story arc is expected to follow the life of a girl, all beginning when she is 11 years old, and eventually ending when she's around 60. In addition it is supposed to be about how the world around her changes. Powers will shift, societies will crumble, cultures will be turned upside down and yeah a space ship will crash on the planet and make things really weird. But that's all for later.   Now, at 11 I cannot expect my future protagonist to do anything but die. Let alone make enough of a difference. She's just a child, after all, and the setting I placed my work in is not a kind one. It's not supposed to be a kids book, I suppose.   Still, I wanted her in it, because her journey begins at 11, and so do a whole lot of other things.   What I have so far paints a different character as the protagonist. He will get the majority of POV-time and be the one that the first book rides on, while said girl will be a fiddle in the background. She'll get to do what I need her to do, and I'll get to introduce three other members of the main cast for the books to follow.   After this adventure concludes, I planned to jump ahead in time by 5 years, and reverse the roles.   Now the previous protagonist is still a main character, but he is now our new protagonist's mentor, and will remain so. He'll by no means be insignificant, but the story won't be as much about  him  as it was before.   My fear is that readers would feel betrayed, should I ever end up publishing this, since they might have been expecting things to just continue the way they had.Summary:
Summarize: The worst part about it is that I built it myself. Brick by brick, fixing it all in place. I've been surrounding myself with a cold, dark, hard room. I didn't notice how bad it had gotten until I realised I hadn't seen any friends for almost 5 months. I sit at home, alone. I go to class, alone. I come back, alone. Then I sit and watch TV shows or movies on my computer. I don't go anywhere else, don't interact with anyone else. The only thing that stops my chest from feeling tight, stops my hands shaking or stops my head from feeling like I just spun around in a chair for an hour is being able to lose myself in music or a fictional world.   It's gotten to the point that I barely eat anything throughout the day, just staring at a screen, or staring at my roof with headphones on. On the bus or train to class I sit and stare out the window, headphones in, avoiding eye contact. I try sitting by myself, choosing to stand over sitting next to anyone. I was never close with my family (aside from my parents, I don't have any family living in the same country).   The problems have bled in to my studies. It started getting bad about a year and a half ago, I would feel shaky and breathing would get difficult right before an exam. Over the last few months it's gotten worse, I feel that way almost as soon as I hear about the exam or assignment. I was never the most hard working student, but I never really let myself get close to failing. Now I'm worried that I could fail almost half my subjects in one semester. My parents both want me to go on and do a postgrad degree, which I don't think I want to do, and know I wouldn't be able to cope with. I don't have any to talk to about this, and I'm scared of the direction that my thoughts have turned to. The word "useless" echos through my mind everyday, more times than I can count. I can't remember the last day that I didn't think about killing myself.   Ever since high school finished I drifted away from all of my friends. I don't feel like I deserve to have friends. I was always shy and quiet as a kid, it's gotten to a different level recently. Whenever I'm out at class, instead of trying to make new friends, I hide away in my shell until I can come home. Whenever I use to see them I consciously kept them at arms length, "If they really got to know you, they would hate you". Now I actively push them away, don't return calls, ignore messages (not that I get many of either, maybe once a month at most, closer to once every few months). Cannot blame them, who would stay friends with someone that tries to actively avoid them.   I've tried letting out the frustration, but I can't. I can't scream, I can't cry, everything either feels numb or feels like my chest is going to explode. Don't understand why this is happening or why it keeps getting worse every day. I feel weak, then hate myself for my lack of strength. I hate myself when I don't see my friends, yet I hate myself too much to actually think I deserve to see them. It feels like I'm throwing myself against the walls and bars of my own psyche, futily, trying to escape from my thoughts, but just beating myself up even more. I just want to be free from all of this.   Sorry if this is poorly written, I'm just tired, hazy and frustrated. I don't know if it's anxiety, or if it's depression, or if I'm just weak. Just needed to write something.Summary:
Summarize: There was a program about this 4/20 on CBC(Great job, guys!) that essentially said that rather than drug trafficking, on of the main concerns that members of the dutch government had was that on Friday afternoons too many people would cross the border and cause congestion in the small border towns. The citizens in rural Holland were angry about this, while most of the citizens in larger cities like Amsterdam were pro-legalization because of the tourist revenue it brought in.   I wonder if they will attempt to establish better infrastructure, and then revisit the system they've had up until now.Summary:
Summarize: This is my first month using opks, and I have a question about reading them:   They've been slowly getting darker over the past week or so. Yesterday the test line was the darkest I've ever seen it, but still not as dark as the control line. DH and I BD just to be sure.   I just took one today, and the test line was much lighter than yesterday. I also noticed my CM has dried up considerably since even earlier this morning. My temp went up a little bit this morning, but not much.   I'm thinking I O'd sometime this afternoon, which would explain the low temp this morning, but dry CM this afternoon.   So is it possible I just missed the LH surge with the OPKs and the darkish line I saw yesterday was as close to positive as I'm going to get?Summary:

Summarize: Little backstory on me:   I'm indian-american (22 male). My parents moved to this country leaving everything they knew and everyone they loved to raise me, I was 3 months old. Everything I learned growing up, I learned fast. I was always the "ugly kid" and also the "most likely to succeed" and "smartest". In kindergarden I was let out for the 2nd half of the semester, placing far forward in my class. In 1st-2nd grade I learned exponents while the class recited times tables out loud. 3rd - 6th grade, teachers had a hard time teaching me, I was bored, it made me a delinquent. Sort of. I would ace any quiz, pass any verbal tests, but never did homework (50 math problems I can solve faster in my head than I can write it? no thank you). The never doing Homework thing still is a problem today. 7th grade to 9th, teachers insisted on failing me, yet pushing me into the advanced classes, I finished my statewide exams before I hit HS. 9th-12th (I should say 9th-9th-10th-10th) I was out of class literally 90% of the time. ON RECORD. I spent my days roaming the halls, and eventually became famously the IT guy. Eventually my 12th year was over and I had a 64% avg, and only passed as many classes as a starting 10th grader. Once the year finished, I took my GED that same week. Passed with a 3350. (SAT's were 1450/1600)   Did some college too, but that's more irrelevant at the moment. I might expand on it later.   My Personal life background: As I mentioned, I'm indian-american. I have 2 loving parents who speak to this day broken english. They worked from garbage men and street sweepers, to my dad having a BS in CS, and working for a firm in manhatten for the last 9+ years, my mom having a job as a nurse and full time mom of 2. Did I mention I have a sister 4 years younger than me? Anyways, I was driven hard by them, but always rebelled. Parents who hardly speak english in a country they don't know, who kept me practically cruelly sheltered growing up ( I didn't attend my first party until I was 17 ), a school life where I failed but only due to my "laziness". I made a choice, to achieve all my great things taking advantage of my test taking and quick learning. I decided this after HS. Turns out that works, except you have to actually want to do it, which after my first success, i didn't. This is the key here. I learned what ADHD was only 2 years ago. I've written more than 500 programs but maybe only a handful are complete. Once I'd code the short term function out, I'd be done and satisfied. I did this for amusement. When you're ADHD and your parents are racist of america, untrusting of the neighborhood (bronx), you are the weird kid, you have no friends, the only outlet I had was my dad brining home an old pentium 2 when I was 10, its all you can do. Hello internet, you were my only frand.   Today I moved state, dropped out of 2 colleges, play guitar, starcraft HOTS, and not much else that's routine. I can't even remember to grab my house keys from my car when I park. I have an amazing GF and 2 close friends, life is bearable. Except I long to do more with my self. I have boundless ambition, always have, wanted to cure cancer so I self studied bio and got a 66% on a practice MCAT, taught myself python,php,mysql,perl,c++,html,js and probably more for my IT career, but really for myself. Yet, I can't hold a job at radio shack and my resume has MSFT as my first employer.   I tried adderall xr. And I wish I could say I had a doctor even test me for anything. But I came across some. Absolutely the most different yet normal I've literally ever felt. Have had it maybe 6-12 times? First time, took me about an hour to settle it in, and then I had new found ambition. I cleaned my car, cleaned my house, cleaned my PC, did all the projects I've been putting off, did the laundry, after all that, sat down and wrote my first entire program in literally 3 years. The next couple of times I learned choose what to what needed doing. I took care of bills, taxes, spruced up a proper resume. Undid all the half assed stuff I could think of.   Took a few days break to see a contrast. Boy was that stark. walk into any room, "what was i doing?", still left keys in my car, hey did we turn the stove off? (yes, 5 times). You get the gist. I had my old attention span of a Fly. So I restarted my regimen. Again, productivity through the roof, happiness higher than I believed possible again, (think a kid discovering his seed sprouted). Until now, I had thought of ADHD as a real thing, but I never recognized it manifested in me. I've even been meaning to write this out but never could until now, guess why. I can't come across the stuff anymore, and my life is still in shambles, I can only achieve short term goals, never save up to pay rent, never remember to do shopping, can't study worth a damn without meds. I do honestly feel dependant on the meds, but only for getting shit done, not for my overall happiness, that is affected by how much shit I get done.   Recently I came across this subreddit and have been reading your stories. I've met them with mixed emotions and I'd love for someone to give me a helping hand. So here's the rub. I'm only self diagnosed, self medicated, and just within this month, aware of my ADHD. I feel like you guys all figured out some coping mechs for yours even when you were young and I didn't so I've screwed up a lot of my potential future. I've been taking your advice, postits everywhere, if I think I'll remember I write it down as much as I can anyways, bowl for keys by the door and what have you. Those fit perfectly into my life. I want more, I want someone to unlock my potential, show me how. I don't have the luxury of removing my distractions, I try to limit it where I can, but I've got the self control of bugs near a zapper on this. I have been obviously told to see a professional and get properly medicated and diagnosed and therapy and what not, and that is the future plan. But as it stands, I don't have the time to devote to that and neither the meds to continue to the point where I hope to have that ability. After working hard at my ADHD I got a job, a real one. I haven't started yet, start next month, its got me very anxious which has obvious stressing effects. On top of that, I've got a trip back home for a couple weeks so I need to get my affairs in order which instead of doing, I'm doing this. I doubt I'll find a doctor who will even see me before the end of july and I'm certain it'll go one of 2 ways. 1. I'll explain myself best I can, come off as sounding like a adderall seeking junkie and go back to zero 2. I'll need to take a test a week later, see my doc for results and stuff a week after, and finally a trial set of non-stimulant meds which fail and the cycle repeats for a couple months. either way, I'm ADHD i think, I've finally found a way to feel sane, have a large milestone in my life in a week, won't have any meds or help for months.Summary:

Summarize: Interesting that it is your go-to source for climate change data though   It's global temperature data, not climate change data.   The reason I have problems with NOAA and NASA presented data is that they have this nasty problem of changing the data from the raw weather station to their final presentation.   One of the two agencies, I would have to dig up which one, reported readings on parts of the planet that didn't have weather stations. They basically said they estimated for those areas.   The reason I like satellite data is that it records the whole world at a uniform rate and with a uniform method rather than relying on cherry picked ground stations and having to fiddle with numbers to adjust for creeping urbanization. Concrete and asphalt warm things up significantly. Cities have the same effect as a brick oven, they soak up solar heat and light all day and radiate it back out as they go, increasing temperatures.   I am all for putting some climate change squarely on the shoulders of these cities, but it would be local climate change. Making regions warmer does really change things. We can even develop this into global climate change since our concrete jungles are positioned many places around the globe and they can heat up the air changing air patterns globally.   But the point is, satellite measurements are pretty solid, even ground stations at local levels are pretty solid, the warming trend from the late seventies through the late nineties has stopped and we are steady now.   The real scientists would ask why this is. The politician will use sensationalism, either "this doesn't mean anything!" or "global warming never happened!" I have heard both, both are a lie. We are warmer than we were in the 1970s, this cannot be denied by any data. We have stopped warming, this too cannot be denied by any data.   Why? Was Carbon Dioxide responsible? well, not directly, not as currently proposed since we have been increasing co2 levels since 1997 and temperatures haven't kept going. Some have started to argue for a delayed effect, others have argued that the impacts of co2 are much lower than previously reported (these people tend to be thrown to the back of the room since they make co2 less scary)   Others have pointed out that co2 rises AFTER warming as the oceans that are warmer hold less gas. (you can test this with soda or champagne).   I point to paleoclimate data reconstructions (take them with the appropriate grain of salt) that show that the average historic concentration of co2 is 2000ppm and we are just crossing 400ppm. we are at 20% of average levels (which helps to explain our stunning lack of forests when compared to millions of years ago, it also helps explain our ancestors' divergence from proto-chimps as our ancestors were kicked out of the jungles).   I also note that when we had 7000ppm (3.5 times the average) the earth was covered in ice.   This really kills a strong and direct connection between co2 and global temperatures.   When people try to cause panic over rising temperatures, I just point out the last 2000 years. We had warming in the 1000s and things didn't crumble, in fact, we flourished! We actually had issues in the 500s and 1500s when temperatures cooled off. in the 1880s we began to warm up again. And by the 1920s we had this amazing thing happening in the arctic, the ice nearly all melted (just like in 2010!!!).   The reason I really try to emphasize the cyclical nature of these events is to attempt to calm down the hysteria from people. Hysterical people make stupid decisions.   1) We have survived warmer AND colder climates before and with modern technology we will do even better.   2) We are builders, rising sea levels will not happen fast enough to kill us, we will just build UP slowly.   Holland did this in the middle ages. The city of Sacramento, California in the 1850s did it on very little money when they got tired of their two rivers flooding them every two years.   It isn't that hard to build sea walls.   A great example of building up that we can see is in the city of Rome, Italy. They excavated their ancient forum from 2000 years ago, the place is like 5 meters below the surface of modern Rome. in 2000 years the city rose up 5 meters!   3) The focus on climate change, even if some one can present testable evidence that humans are some how causing this climate change (That somehow fits into the natural cycle parameters...) it's nothing near the threat people make it out to be, and it diverts resources from what I argue is the real human caused threats of toxic pollution.   Humans are builders. We build things. Sometimes we don't think things through enough for we are impulsive or cluttered even.   In the 1930s American farming methods on the great planes caused soil erosion and with the massive droughts in the 1930s (the EPA still records that as the hottest and driest time in recorded history. The US government cannot even get their agencies to agree on basic scientific data...) the soil dried up and blew away.   I had the fortune to interview a lady who grew up in the dustbowl, and she told me some crazy and scary stories about dust storms. Well we did learn a thing or two from that and our farmers, not out of ecological interest, but economic interest, improved their methods. (no profit can be had when your soil flies away!).   We damaged that part of our country, our world, and we learned how we screwed up and we didn't do it again. But now we have a shortage of ground water because of other mistakes. They are working on pro-actively stopping problems from that, lets hope they figure out the right things.   in the 1700s the UK developed steam engines, and by the 1750s James Watt made the Steam Engine really useful. By the 1850s the UK had tons of steam engines for industrial use and they burned dirty coal.   Sure when it was just a small mine or factory, burning coal wasn't an issue, the soot could be washed out and dealt with. Pack London and Manchester full of these things and it overloaded the systems. Things got bad.   By the 1890s cities in the US and Germany and Japan had the same issues!   So we started to take steps, we looked for ways to clean things up and switched from coal steam plants to oil driven electrical plants, which were much cleaner.   By the 1960s we realized that even oil was dumping unwanted chemicals in the air so we improved upon them too! Now, I am not saying "problem solved, let's watch the game!" I am saying "Progress is moving toward a solution, 80% improvement."   London's fog is white again.   LA and California will always have smog, but at least now it is 75% natural smog (there is natural smog, both LA and California are climactic bowls with lots of mountains to constrain our air, nifty stuff really).   What about toxic dumping. We are builders, not just of great machines and towers, but of tiny chemicals. We create toxic stuff. Our ancient traditions of waste was just to toss it, "over there" and be done with it.   In ancient cities many places developed plumbing (it seems it was more common than had been thought!) but in middle ages Europe, the new commercial urban settings didn't really have pluming. They dumped their chamber pots right out the window.   People in cities kept getting sick right up until the 20th century when plumbing returned in force. That toxic waste was dealt with, but welcome to the electronic ages.   Companies would have toxic waste and just dump it on cheap empty lots. Then poor people would build houses on those lots and... get sick.   So now we are working to clean that up.   They dumped crap in the ocean because... it's fucking huge! And then realized the currents drove that crap right back to the shore. So now we are working on changing that, but some people realize that if they dump here, the currents take the crap to the jerks up stream... So they don't care. Sad, hard to stop.   Nuclear waste, they made fission plants and only used 10% of the power in the uranium. Nuclear waste is hot, it can be used for power, but they don't want to invest the money to recycle it. (such recycling plants would be politically unpopular too!) So they store it in a mountain until we can build such a plant.   So...Summary:
Summarize: Saturday night went well for the most part.   I agree with everyone that said it's not a good idea to take it for the first time with a bunch of people you don't know. The group I was with are really into charging, ecspecially on pills, and as I was in the same mind set I took a tab, E and had some weed (along with drinking some alcohol). It sounds insane but I had a great time.   The highlight of my night was sitting in a bathroom with this guy I'd met a couple of times and my friend and her boyfriend staring at a painting for hours. My friend and her boyfriend left the room and the other guy and I held our hands under water, finding the 'perfect temperature' and just playing with it. Our fascination moved away from the sink and in to the bath where I had a couple of my friends throw their head in to experience the water as much as they could without getting their whole bodies in.   Eventually the guy I had been in the bathroom with had to leave because he had to work the next day which brought down my high a bit as we were on the same trip. We watched [Bad Taste]( and [Blow]( which was amazing.   The biggest downfalls of the night was some dodgey guy trying to crack on to me (I'm a girl) and me almost punching him in the face, (we eventually locked him out) And waking up in the morning and feeling like I was coming down really hard. On my way home I talked alot of smack with friends I bumped into and tripped out alot on my way and at home. I slept for 21 hours the next day (had two other big nights before this one). Now I know next time I'll take it with close friends in a familiar enviroment, but all in all it was an amazing experience and I plan on doing it again.Summary:

It sounds crazy but I had a great time. The highlight of my night was to sit in a bathroom with this guy who had met a couple of times and my friend and his boyfriend looking at a picture for hours. My friend and his boyfriend left the room and the other guy and kept our hands under the water, finding the ‘perfect temperature’ and just playing with him. Our fascination went out of the sink and in the bathroom where I had a couple of my friends throw their heads to experience the water as much as they could in the morning without getting to the street.
I agree with everyone that it wasn't a good idea to take it for the first time with a bunch of people you don't know. The group with which I was really in charge, especially on pills, and since I was in the same setting I took a tab, E and had some weeds (together with drinking some alcohol). It sounds crazy, but I had a great time. The climax of my night was in a bathroom with this guy I sat a few times and my girlfriend and her boyfriend stared at a painting for hours. My girlfriend and her boyfriend left the room and the other guy and I kept our hands underwater, the "perfect temperature" and just playing with him. Our fascination moved away from the sink and into the bathtub where I had a few of my friends throwing their heads into the water as much as they could without having their whole body in. Finally, the guy I was in the bathroom because he had to work down to the next day that we put in a crack.
Summarize: She left me for the second time, saying I don't care. The idea of not caring about her kills me. I think I've accepted that I'm never going to see her again. Honestly, after 5 years, I love her too much to begin another relationship. Most people think that it's stupid to get hung up over a girl that doesn't care about me, as if she were doing fine. I know she's not fine though. I know she's suffering as much as I am.   In other news, I'm flunking college again. I've applied to and interviewed for more jobs than I can count, but none of them can get past the idea that I haven't finished college. Even the part-time jobs aren't hiring. I have three days to decide whether to go back to school and I'm beginning to think I'm just going to end up going because I have no other choice.   After her and I broke up I started seeing someone else in a non-romantic (not even really sexual) way. I messaged her today and she didn't answer, but I could tell she read it because the program tells me. Maybe I'm too lonely, but I expected a reply. I get it though. She's going through some depression too. I used to cut people off like I wasn't worth it but now that I'm actually reaching out to people, it seems that no one cares. Even when I reach out over the Internet. Tinder and the like offer only douchy gay guys (I'm not homophobic, just these guys are really douchy. I'm actually polysexual.). Reddit has yielded no results, after posting here and the advice column (I wasn't in the advice column for my depression, rather it was about getting into a second relationship with her).   My family only wants to talk about getting a job, getting a psychologist, going to school... They don't care about my emotions or anything I need to talk about. They don't ask about my relationships. My stepmom thinks that once I get on medication, I'll magically feel better, because that was her experience, but I'm sick of everyone telling me that they understand. Understanding doesn't make me feel better, and no, they don't understand, otherwise they would know what I need from them. I'm going to talk to one of them about what I need from them today.   Last but not least, let me talk about the purpose of this title. When it comes to people I don't feel regular emotions, it feels like. My ex has a point in saying I don't care, because I can see how she sees that. Truth is, I don't worry. People constantly need others to worry about them. I need emotional support, but I wouldn't wish anyone to worry about me. Yet people do it all the time. It's stupid. It's an unnecessary stressor on everyone, and for someone who stresses about everything, it's the least I need in my life, to have to worry about someone as if they're fragile toothpicks. What's more is that everyone worries about me all the time. I don't understand. I'm an adult. I'll be fine. What I need from people is to feel loved and emotionally taken care of, not for someone to pander over me like I'm going to break any second now. Anyway, enough rambling. Thanks for reading.Summary:

Summarize: So...  This is just unexplainable.   Let me start with some information of the day. My mum was in the hospital being treated for malaria . I was at home doing my home-work or something I guess. So I didn't have a mobile or anything and the house was empty since my father was out and my sister was sleeping or maybe she was out too.   Anyway. What I remember is that the house was empty so I turned on the radio to listen to music to do math   So I turn on the radio walk to my table....... In doing so the radio switch off. I though "there goes the radio" I walk up to it in hopes of banging it a couple of times...... and it as soon as I come close to it ... it just turns on.. "yeay" I walk back and it switches off.   Freaked for a second .. then just tried to move my books near the radio.   Dad came home... showed him... He's freaked and intrigued .   Been 4-5 years since then.. still haven't figured it outSummary:
So I didn't have a motive or anything and the house was empty since my father was out there and my sister was sleeping or maybe she was out there too. Anyway, whatever it is. What I remember is that the house was empty so I turned on the radio to listen to music to do math. So I'm going to be on the radio to get the radio off. Although "the radio is going" I'm walking towards her hoping to hit her a few times... and as soon as I get close to her... it lights up... "yes" I'm coming back and it stops. Frequently... then I just tried to move my books near the radio. Dad came home... showed him... he's panicked and intrigued.
Summarize: So... This is inexplicable. Let me start with some information of the day. My mother was in the hospital being treated for malaria. I was at home doing my work at home or something I guess. So I didn’t have a cell phone or something and the house was empty since my father was out and my sister was sleeping or maybe she was out too. Anyway. What I remember is that the house was empty so I turned on the radio to listen to music to do mathematics so I turned on the radio walking to my table.......... When I did, the radio went out. I thought that “there goes the radio” I came up with the hope of hitting her a couple of times... and as soon as I approached her... she just lit up. “Yes” I went back on foot and went out.
Summarize: I'm a twenty-four year old female and my boyfriend and I are becoming more and more serious as time goes on. We have been together for one year now. Here is the problem: his brother, who he lives with, is an absolute asshole. Before going on to describe why this is such a problem for me, I want to talk a little more about his brother, who I will call Josh.   Josh regularly describes the shitty ways he treats women and the shitty ways he tries to sleep with as many women as possible. Now, while I don't necessarily think it's bad to sleep with a lot of people (if it's consensual and done respectfully on both parts), he intentionally manipulates women to get what he wants and then is really mean to them after things are over. He admitted to having left a girl in the middle of the woods when she was high on ecstasy and he was drunk (he was driving) because she annoyed him and he no longer felt like getting in her pants.   Another example: this summer he knew this one girl who he had met online wanted a relationship from her online profile, yet he went out on a date with her solely for the intention of having sex with her and never sleeping with her again. He hadn't slept with anyone in four months, so he really just wanted to get laid. Now I know a lot of people do this, and I can understand his sexual frustration, but the way he did it was really shitty. He slept with her, then the next day talked to my boyfriend and I about how fat she was and how disgusting she was and what bad lay it was. These things are possible, but the way he discusses them is rude and uncalled for. It's simply indicative of his general disrespect for women. He has a technique he has called the "machine gun makeout" which is basically to keep leaning in to kiss a woman, and each time she turns away, he tries again, and keeps trying until she gives in. He combines this technique with his "drink technique" of buying girls a drink, letting them drink half, then slamming the rest himself and buying them another one. This one is based on the theory that girls drink the first half of their drink really fast and the last half slow. He is honestly this manipulative.   One time Josh made a pass at me about two months after his brother and I were official and I (obviously) turned him down. I told him "I couldn't be less attracted to you given your shallow personality", yet when I told his brother about it Josh claimed I had been wanting him all along and was asking for it.   Josh spends all his days off work smoking weed, drinking, and trying to use more women for sex. I don't have any problem with weed and drinking, but both of those things are pretty much all he ever does. He has no ambition. No wish to find someone he cares about and settle down. No wish to ever have kids. He just wants to go to work and then party on his days off.   Lastly, Josh is terrible with money. He makes almost $100k a year but lives paycheck to paycheck, spending it all on buiyng more "toys" (e.g. dirtbike, jetboat, truck). Again, I'm not against buying nice things for yourself as long as you budget and save for the future. He once asked me (I'm in medical school), "What kind of STUFF are you going to buy once you are a doctor?" I told him that I was going to buy a house first of all, and he laughed and said, "NO. COOL stuff! Mercedes? Mustang?" He really doesn't understand that there are things to life other than money. He asked my boyfriend to go half and half on a mortgage so they could buy a house together. I did not give my opinion because I felt it was none of my business, but was secretly SO relieved when my boyfriend told him no. I think it's a terrible idea to enter into such a long-term financial commitment with someone who is hugely in debt and can't hold onto money even with a great paying job.   Anyways... back to the beginning. I hate this person more than I've ever hated anyone. I haven't described the half of it because I want to keep this short enough for people to read, but I hope you can understand the situation. My question is... would this be a dealbreaker for anyone? Up until this point in the post I haven't talked about my relationship with my boyfriend, but let me just say it is INCREDIBLE. Amazing communication. Amazing sex. We are seriously perfect partners. He makes me laugh so much that I cry sometimes. But sometimes I imagine the future and I feel sick. His brother's financial habits seem to influence him somewhat. He isn't as terrible as Josh is, but he definitely doesn't save money. I am a huge saver (seeing as how I had to put myself through medical school) and I could see those mentalities conflicting. Also if we have kids one day... his brother will be their uncle. And I couldn't keep the kids away from his brother, that would be unfair to my boyfriend. So my hypothetical children would be influenced by this man (who trust me, will never change - he never wants to get married or have children, so he will always be that creepy uncle josh). I think it would be even worse if I had boys because he would want to do things with them and teach them his "techniques" with women. It makes me want to punch something imagining these children who don't even exist yet having to be around this man who I despise with a passion.   So anyways. Despite this perfect relationship with my boyfriend, do you think this sort of thing (hating one of his family members so much) could ruin it? I know that typical answers on this thread are "end it, move on", but I would appreciate some input other than that because it's not realistic. It seems silly to end a great relationship because of someone who isn't even one of the members of the relationshp. It should just be about me and my boyfriend, right? At this point it's easy to ignore his brother as we're doing distance while I finish my last year of medical school. But at some point in the next year we will be hopefully living close by again and I will once more have to deal with his brother on a regular basis since they live together. And potentially deal with his brother for the rest of my life. This pains me.   Any thoughts would be appreciated, especially if anyone has ever been in a similar circumstance!Summary:

Summarize: If you really don’t care that much about decade-old problems, you should start reading this at the fourth paragraph . The first thing that needs to be taken into account is that this is not a problem limited to 1998-2002. Origins could be traced back all to way back to WWII, but leaving excruciating details aside, the fact is that Argentinean economics after WWII were heavily conditioned by inflation. From 1945 onwards, inflation would reach peaks of up to 113% annually, with an average of 25% from 1945-71, and up to 60% the following years.   This situation was of course worsened by the military dictatorships’ policies, in addition to the economic crisis of 1980, as well as the Falklands war. The last dictatorship fell in 1983 due to (you guessed it!) economic hardship and the first democratic president, Raúl Alfonsín, was elected. He implemented a plan to change the currency by removing zeros and changing its name to the “Austral”, in addition to other structural reforms. To get an idea of the currency’s constant loss of value: by 1945, 4 Argentinean pesos could be exchanged for 1 USD, then by 1985, 1 new Austral was worth 1 billion pesos (1 USD ≈ 1 Austral = 1,000,000,000 m$n).   This “Austral” plan of course failed miserably, since it did nothing to really change the underlying problem of inflation. The Austral started off almost at parity with the US dollar in 1985, but by 1990 you would need 10,000 Australes to buy one dollar, and the percentage of inflation was measured in the thousands. Unsurprisingly, Alfonsín was promptly sacked.   After that, Carlos Menem is elected president and this is when things begin to take shape to create the scenario for the crisis. Menem was a diehard neoliberal heavily influenced by the principles of the Washington consensus. One of the most notable acts of the Menem administration was the privatization of many state owned companies such as Entel or Aerolineas Argentinas, and subsequently companies linked to TV, railways, oil and gas. Also, he dismantled many regulations on the economy such as quotas, duty taxes, restrictions on imports and controlled prices. Lastly, in an attempt to stop hyperinflation, he implemented something that translated roughly to “Convertibility Law”. This law would strictly tie the national currency to the US dollar, and subsequently created a new currency (once again…) called the “Peso convertible”.   From this point on, the exchange rate could not fluctuate; it was a fixed 1 dollar for 1 peso. This obviously meant that the central bank had to guarantee with its own reserves that each peso could be exchanged for a dollar or for its value in gold. This would later turn out to be too heavy of a burden for the government to bear, but for the first years it did drastically stop inflation. Also, Argentina’s GDP began to grow steadily for the first half of the 90’s, although growth was not homogenously distributed among different economic sectors.  Some sectors were heavily damaged and unemployment began to be more and more a growing concern. At the end, the legacy of the Menem administration was a huge government budget deficit of 7 billion pesos, an equally huge foreign debt of 145 billion and a burden on the central bank to maintain the Convertibility Law.   So after Menem failed to change the constitution in order to be elected for the 3rd consecutive time, Fernando de la Rúa was elected as the new president in 1999… and this is when shit really starts to go down. The foreign debt was proving to be too big of a burden and it was adding to the already huge government budget deficit. Many big banks were heavily invested in the national government, so there was an increasing fear that the government could default. This fear was exponentially bigger within the general population whose savings were in those banks whose solvency depended on the government being able to pay its debts. So after a failed attempt to calm the market down by injecting 40 billion dollars and by postponing payments farther in the future,  the public finally panicked . People started to massively withdraw their money from banks, 5 billion US dollars worth of deposits were lost from January to March 2001.   The government then tried to negotiate a package of 29.5 billion dollars with the IMF and some private banks in an attempt to reduce the burden of the foreign debt. However, as it is tradition with the IMF, they only agreed to the package if the Argentinean government implemented unpopular measures that were basically a big fuck-you to its citizens. At the end this served for close to nothing and capital outflow and recession continued at a staggering pace.   At this point, the government imposed heavy restrictions which would later be called  “El Corralito”  or little “corral”. For those of you who don’t know what a corral is, it’s [this]( An enclosed space in which livestock is kept,  a very appropriate term .   The Corralito consisted on restrictions, both on financial entities and common people, as a last resort to stop deposit outflow and to discourage speculation that the “Convertibility Law” would be dismantled. These restrictions were very harsh; people could only get access to $250 a week, even if you had tens of thousands in your account and had many expenses. So of course this sudden restriction of liquidity halted all economic activity: it paralyzed commerce, froze credit, people and companies could not make payments to other people or companies who subsequently also couldn’t make payments. Ultimately, this created such civil unrest that de la Rúa was deposed.   Then Rodriguez Saá assumed the presidency for two weeks, in which he declared that the government would default, the biggest default in history. However, he refused to leave the Convertibility Law, reason for which he was deposed. Eduardo Duhalde then took office, and the first thing he did was to dismantle the Convertibility Law and to turn all credit to Pesos. With the Convertibility Law, the peso was fixed at one dollar, so even if you could only access $250 a week, theoretically the money you had in the bank would not lose its value. However, after the Law was waived, a new exchange rate was established: 1 USD = 1.40 Pesos. This literary meant that people lost tons of money overnight. However, debt owed to the financial system would still be paid at 1 USD = 1 Peso, this was called “asymmetric pesification”. And then finally, after the damage was done, the end of “The Corralito” was announced in December 2002. The Supreme Court backed the government’s “pesification” at $1.40 for every dollar, plus inflation, and a 4% annual interest rate. At the end, after the deposits were freed, the final result was around 3 pesos for every dollar. So yeah… many people got fucked over.   I understand that I left out many things, like the IMF constant meddling, cold war relations, the Mexican crisis of 1994, military dictatorships, etc. But this turned out pretty long as it is; it’s very hard to properly explain this without writing an actual paper on it.  So please cut me some slack.Summary:
The first thing to take into account is that this is not a problem limited to 1998-2002. The origins were traced back to the Second World War, but we must leave behind excruciating details, the fact is that the Argentine economy after the Second World War was heavily conditioned by inflation. From 1945, inflation would reach peaks of up to 113 per cent per year, with an average of 25 per cent between 1945 and 1971, and up to 60 per cent of the following years.
Summarize: It was a summer in the year 2005, small beach town on the coasdt of Southern California. I, at the time, was 19, hanging out with a couple buddies when we heard of a Volcom factory party in Costa Mesa. So we head over there.   I had 3 beers before we got to the door, so I was feeling pretty buzzed (i'm a lightweight). I show the doorman my ID and he gives me a 21+ wristband. And all of my underage friends as well. So we go in and they have a full OPEN bar and in random buckets, redstripe beer and wine. So I grab some more beer and start drinking. Before I know it, I was hitting on random young ladies with my new found self confidence. One girl came up and we started talking but I thought she was into me so I grabbed her and kissed her, but as soon as I realized she wasn't kissing me back I let go and all my friends laughed and she stormed away.   I wandered around asking more girls if they want to make out but none obliged, so I found myself upstairs with a bottle of cheap wine and I drank about half of it. I then meandered downstairs and by this time I was so drunk I could barely walk. I saw my friend and I said, "watch this" and kicked the wall and a huge picture fell off it. We were then escorted out, and by this time we were all drunk and it was around 2am. So stupidly my friend drove drunk. I blacked out for about 30 mins until I got woken up by my friend yelling at me to "GET THE FUCK UP AND OUT OF THE CAR!!!!!!!!!!!!" So naturally, I did. We were at a church. He told me to go kick the church van. So we both, drunk, started kicking this random church van. I remember I kicked it so hard I fell down. Then I ran over and kicked a sign. Then got back in his car and drove off.Summary:

Summarize: Hi /r/legaladvice, I apologise for the wall of text but I did not want to miss anything out. I am a student in the United Kingdom in my third year and since October/November 2015 there has been a very large problem with mould in my bedroom.   October/November 2015 Initially I thought the problem may have been caused by having the heating on too low (we are students and were trying to save as much money as possible) but this proved to not be the case. After turning the heating up, buying a moisture absorber, keeping windows and doors open whenever it was feasible, cleaning as much of the mould as possible and a variety of other preventative measures, the mould persisted. The mould was mainly focused around the window initially, but I discovered that it had in fact spread across 2 of the 4 walls, behind posters, the chest of drawers and even inside the wardrobe. There was a huge amount of damage to my possessions; I had to throw out my hiking backpack, a variety of clothes and get my suit (which had been in the wardrobe) professionally cleaned.  ,  , the case of my tennis racquet was also damaged, as was my suitcase but I managed to salvage both of those  ,   (I don't think I have a picture of the suitcase). I immediately contacted the landlord who begrudgingly came round the next day at which point he blamed me and my housemates for creating too much moisture by cooking, drying clothes indoors (which we didn't do), breathing(!) and not having the heating on high enough.   January 2016 I left for the Christmas holidays at the start of December and left my room door open for the duration to get at least a little flow of air through the room. When I returned, the mould too had made a reappearance with a vengeance and the room had a terrible, lingering smell of mould for several days after cleaning it. The paintwork on the wall had begun to bubble up from accumulated mould behind it and the paint began to crumble off the wall. I contacted the landlord again and he came over with some bathroom mould spray and sponges which he gave me to clean the mould. He also noticed that the guttering at the top of the afflicted wall had been blocked and water had saturated through the wall into my bedroom (it was clearly wet through from the outside). He called a maintenance team to come and clear the gutter and they arrived 2 weeks later to clear the gutter. This did not stop the wall from being saturated within the next 6 or so weeks before the end of term and I continued to wipe down the wall with mould spray every couple of days to remove accumulated mould. It was around this time that I was diagnosed with long-standing depression, which had been strongly exacerbated by university stress and in particular the conditions that I was living in. These are pictures of the wall in question taken as soon as I came back to my room in January  ,  ,   April 2016 I returned after the Easter Holiday (left my door open again during the holiday) to find that the mould had once again returned and my room once again had a terrible smell in it. The wall was still visibly soaked through from the outside and on the plasterboard from the inside of the room. I continued to wipe the wall down with the bleach spray and hoped that with the warmer weather and me now being in the house after the holidays, the mould would finally disappear. This was not the case and the mould still persisted and in fact had begun to get worse. It became the case that I had to wipe the wall down in the morning and then later in the evening every single day.   20 April 2016 On Wednesday 20th I texted the landlord explaining that the mould remained a significant problem and the only solution (however temporary it may prove to be) would be to strip as much of the bubbling wallpaper off as possible and wipe the entire plasterwork behind with bleach. I had not done this myself yet because it was both outside the specification of the tenant contract and because I did not want to have my damage deposit taken away for damaging the wall. Also on the 20th I contacted the citizen's advice bureau who suggested I contact the environmental health agency as well as recording all communication with the landlord. I waited patiently for a response from my landlord until the evening of Sunday 24th at which point I rang him myself. I explained, as in the text, that the mould had been getting worse and the paint needed stripping. He said to 'leave it with him' and he will 'come over when he has a spare moment'. I asked when he thought he would be able to come by and he said very irritably that he would 'come by during NORMAL business hours' and proceeded to hang up. I want to reiterate that I had contacted him on the previous Wednesday morning. I am writing this now and will call the environmental agency in the morning (I wanted to speak to the landlord before contacting them)   This is the situation my wall is in at the moment:  ,  ,  ,  Does anyone have any advice for my situation? What can I do as a tenant with a landlord who seems to not care about what is actually a serious problem for me. The whole situation has had a tremendously detrimental effect on both my physical and mental health as this is the room that I sleep, work and relax in. I am unsure where to go with this and whether there even is anything I can do.Summary:

Summarize: So I'll keep this short, about 7 months ago (by recommendation from this subreddit), I built my own gaming PC. Trying to think of the best upgrade now.

Play on a 42 inch 1080p LCD TV.   Anyhow, I have some spare cash (about £150 $200), and seeing as gaming is a major hobby of mine I figure I'd invest it.   Considered a few things.     Upgrading RAM to 16gb (don't see much point though tbh)   Using a projector (probably too complicated for my room)   Moving to SSD (not sure it's worth it, they are expensive)     So that's pretty much what I'm asking for help with, what would be a wise upgrade? Doesn't have to be a PC part per say - could be a useful gadget or anything related.Summary:

Summarize: Lightning/Fang/Hope turns into a great party in Chapter 12. But for Chapter 9 (which is when you can first change your supporting party) it's not that great. In Chapter 9 Hope lacks any offensive buff and Fang lacks any debuff that augments damage. Namely, Hope lacks Enspells (e.g., Enfire, Enwater) and Fang lacks Deprotect, Deshell, and Imperil. Hope learns two Enspells in Chapter 10, the other two in Chapter 11, and Haste in Chapter 12, whereas Sazh already knows all of them. Fang learns Deprotect and Deshell in Chapter 11 and Imperil in Chapter 12, whereas Vanille already knows all of them.   Don't underestimate offensive buffs and debuffs. An appropriate Enspell on a Commando doubles his/her damage output. Deprotect/Deshell effectively doubles physical/magical damage to its affected target (really it's an x1.89 multiplier). Bravery/Faith serve as an x1.4 multiplier which is smaller in relation to the other two, but is still something. Imperil raises elemental weaknesses by one level (Absorbs -> Immune -> Resistant -> Halves -> Normal -> Weakness), which usually opens an enemy to an elemental weakness that can be exploited with the appropriate Enspell. Put together, Enspell + Deprotect/Deshell + Bravery/Faith (+ Imperil if needed) = x5.292 damage multiplier  without considering the enemy chain!   This is why Sazh and Vanille function much better than Hope and Fang before Chapter 12. I highly recommend using them.   Some useful paradigms to note:   RAV/RAV/SAB (Smart Bomb): Saboteur debuffing is useful for the above reasons, and doing it in Smart Bomb is very wise. SABs both raise the chain  and  stabilize it very well (on average much better than COMs). Plus the chaining from the RAVs will increase the chances of the SAB debuffs being inflicted.   SYN/RAV/RAV (Malevolence): Best done after the chain has enough maintenance. Leading with the SYN is my greatest recommendation as it gives you direct control over buffing (make sure you select buffs manually instead of relying on Auto-support!). Prioritize only the relevant buffs; don't waste time with Veil against enemies that don't inflict debuffs, or Shell against enemies with almost no magical attacks.   RAV/RAV/RAV (Tri-disaster): This paradigm is optimal for chaining. Nothing beats it. People like to think that COM/RAV/RAV will add maintenance, which is okay for starting chain maintenance, but if everyone has 4-5 ATB and Haste, Tri-disaster can hold its own. For tougher enemies, it is also optimal to spend an additional round or two here in order to further boost the chain and optimize post-stagger damage dealing (fyi, Fira, Blizzara, and the other -ra spells get a chain bonus post-stagger that makes them much more efficient for chaining than most alternatives).   COM/COM/RAV (Aggression) or COM/COM/COM (Cerberus): The optimal damage dealing paradigm. Use this post-stagger to really beat down the enemy. If you're using Vanille or Hope in your party, they won't have access to their COM roles until Chapter 10, so you'd have to make do with Aggression. Be aware that if you are facing multiple enemies, different COMs will attack different targets.   COM/COM/MED (Tireless Charge) or RAV/RAV/MED (Thaumaturgy): In case you need to heal. COM/COM/MED is for emergency healing during stagger; RAV/RAV/MED is for healing while you're still building chain. COM/RAV/MED seems like a nice compromise, but usually it falls short of being helpful.   COM/RAV/SEN (Delta Attack) and RAV/RAV/SEN (Mystic Tower): These are great for enemies that pack a punch. SENs are really good for focusing enemy attacks on one target. In case of emergency, you could go with COM/SEN/MED (Solidarity) to keep the SEN alive... but really, focus more on the offensive and less on the defensive.   Also, one handy trick: If you have room in your paradigm deck, have two of the same paradigm to utilize ATB refreshes. Every 12 seconds, shifting to a new paradigm enables you to start executing spells immediately without waiting for the ATB to refill. This usually amounts to spending two rounds in one paradigm before shifting. If you have, say, two Tri-disasters, shifting between them every other round makes chaining go a bit faster.Summary:
Summarize: Actually, it's because theaters don't make money off of ticket sales, they go to the studios and stuff. The money a theater makes comes from 2 things, ads before the movies, and concessions. Having worked at a theater, during the non-busy times it takes at least 5 people to operate a theater, at $7.25/hr (Federal Minimum Wage), plus a little more because 2 of those are managers. That's, during the non-busy times, $36.25/hr (More, actually, remember the managers), and during the busy times you're more likely to require 11 people, I'm going to stop doing all the math, because I think you get my point. Also, the average cost for a 16 auditorium theater? $16 million dollars, so they're making that up too. Everyone knows it's expensive, but it's the only way they make money.Summary:

These people do drills to maintain and improve their skill and there is no shortcut there. I took an extended hiatus and miss a few season, so when I came back I was nowhere near as good as I had been before. However I got myself an upgrade 60 hz -> 144 hz and man I wish I had one of those babies back when I was playing  pre-hiatus.   It is worth it to get one, I mean you can use it for like 5 years on every game you have and end up getting in the future. Take the hit on your bank account and get one of these!Summary:
Summarize: I am not religious personally, but I agree that if there is a God, he loves people for who they are!! If you believe that God made us, then why would people be gay if he was not okay with that? Why would he make people LGBTQ if he had a problem with it? And don't tell me it's the devil's work... because if you believe in that then the devil's work is pain, torture, sadism (NOT in a consensual sexual way), sociopathic tendencies, and things like that. The answer is that he wouldn't make people gay if he hated gays... we wouldn't exist if God had a problem with us, because  he wouldn't have made us this way if he had a problem with it!   I will never believe that God is as judgemental as some religions make him out to be. I think that if he is real, he cares a hell of a lot more about what kind of person you are and how you treat other people than who you have a crush on. It is your actions towards other people in this world that matters, not what gender you fall in love with or what gender you identify as. I will never judge a person solely based on their religion. I will form an opinion of them based on how they treat other people and whether or not they respect and accept them. And I think that if God exists... he would want you to love and accept every person no matter their race, nationality, religious beliefs, gender, or sexual orientation. This world and God (if that is your beliefs) is about love, acceptance, and forgiveness... not hatred, bigotry, and discrimination. He is about accepting people and showing them love and compassion, not about hating them and shunning/ignoring them or segregation and victimization against people for who they are.   I'm happy to see someone like you... who has strong religious beliefs but also accepts and loves people the way that you should. Fuck spreading hatred, fuck being a bigot... spread love, spread , spread warmth, spread light, and most importantly spread love. Thank you for your comment, it makes me extremely happy to run into wonderful people like you in this world. Keep being you brother and keep spreading your knowledge of how we should treat others... the world needs more people like you, and I am honored to be able to talk to someone who is as wonderful as you are.   Side note/happy story: a dear friend of mine recently came out to her suuuper conservative and religious parents. She was afraid that they would react with fear, hatred and anger. Instead, they reacted with love, acceptance and complete support. I love people like you who know that the real meaning of life is to spread joy and kindness. The real meaning to life is to dispel hate and to welcome good people with open arms no matter who they like, what they look like, what they believe, etc.   Thank you for being you. You are the type of person who will help to change the world and make it a better, more beautiful place, for everyone to live in harmoniously. I love you man/woman :) <3.Summary:

Summarize: By any chance, does anyone close to you suffer from alcoholism?   Let me just start off by saying that  may  a much bigger impact on you than you would think.   If not, than let me say that going to counseling is not a bad idea. You could listen to helpful suggestions, such as 'fake it till you make it' that many will comment about, but I find them to be conventional advice to the average Joe. What is best advice to you is probably from a professional specialized to folk like you who desire change, but who also do not know the best approach for the change.   I, 23 and male, too am an introvert and never have had a serious relationship. As someone suggested,  the feeling of 'faking it' makes it as feel 'plastic' is all too familiar. Going to counseling has led me to confront issues with my family and reasoning for my social issues: why I don't connect with people socially, why I'm overtly anxious when I'm with a crowd of strangers, why I am alone and I don't have many close friends. The therapy itself has led me to a new perspective of life. I prefer not to get in the details of 'why' my life is the way it is (because I can go on and on)   The point I'm trying to make is that maybe, just maybe, your 'last piece of your puzzle' isn't what you stated, maybe something different.Summary:

Summarize: I stumbled onto it. I had leveled 3 or 4 toons to Anor Londo(ish) trying to decide which playstyle I liked the best. Ended up going back to my first toon(dex/int in case you were wondering). Right after Anor Londo I cleared Duke's and Seath.   I decided to take a break from the lord soul areas after dealing with Duke's and the Crystal Cave(beautiful, yet aggravating) so, I ventured back to Darkroot to Sif and on my way I was thinking "Hmm, have I killed the hydra and freed Dusk yet?". The DLC did not even occur to me as I had avoided spoilers fairly well and did not realize Dusk was related.   Anywho, turned out I had killed the hydra. I went to Dusk's summon spot and did not see her sign. "Hmm, must not have freed her yet.". Headed to  the spot, saw some swirly purple shit and was like "Huh. This is new." And that's all she wrote.Summary:

So you basically have millions of people's private data being stored at risk for reasons that the NSA cannot even prove help insure US security in any way.

Summarize: Short answer is that it didn't view much of anything.   Chinese contact with anything west of central Asia was infrequent, at best. Middle-men mostly carried out the trade along the "silk road" (really a network of trade routs). A few Chinese officials did make it as far west as Persia, but rarely beyond that. Allegedly a Roman trader or two made it to Vietnam, but that's about it from the west. The Chinese saw the Romans as "civilized" people from what reports they had, but did not have any substantial contact with Rome.   The Chinese never even noticed Rome fall. There were decades, at least, between Chinese visits far enough west to know what was going on there. The change from what we recognize as the Roman Empire to what we call the Byzantine Empire was very gradual. The whole idea that Rome "fell" isn't entirely accurate. The Eastern Roman Empire continued on for centuries, and the changes across the empire were subtle and gradual. The later Roman Empire was almost nothing like Augustus's empire, but had far more in common with the "Byzantine" empire. Grouping the former two together and separating the latter is just a matter of how historians have traditionally organized history, not a reflection of how the empire gradually changed over time.   The fall of Constantinople to the Turks in 1453 is also somewhat arbitrary. Why do we consider that the end of Rome's empire? Why not the Fourth Crusade? The Empire of Trebizond, Despotate of the Morea, and Despotate of Epirus were all successor states to "Byzantium" as much as it was a successor state to Rome. Why not count their conquests as the end of the Roman Empire?   As far as the Chinese knew, the eastern provinces (particularly Syria and later Anatolia) were the center of Roman civilization, anyway, so the decline of the west did not matter to them. Even the decline of the eastern Roman Empire in favor of later Islamic states went relatively unnoticed due to the long periods of no information from anything that far west. When Chinese and European people began to interact more in the 17th-18th centuries, they really didn't exchange much historical knowledge. Neither side seemed to care that much about the others' past, and had far more pressing concerns (such as trade or missionary activities).   By the time Chinese historians started looking at European history, I believe they focused on more recent events, but historiography about Chinese views of Europe is well beyond anything I've studied. I would be willing to bet that the Chinese cared about the "fall of Rome" and final fall of Constantinople even less than Europeans cared about the end of the Han dynasty or the fall of the Ming, since Rome's decline was so gradual while the Chinese dynasties ended more suddenly.Summary:
Summarize: Actually, it depends on what you mean by punishment.   Feeling that someone that you look up to (that you want to take pride in your actions) is disappointed with you after one of your actions hurts. I don't actually know what the emotion is called that you feel when someone you really think is the main component of your life is crushing your heart by telling you that you did something wrong enough to make them feel bad about you and perhaps their parenting, but it is a powerful one that makes you take a vow to yourself to never disappoint them again.   On the other hand, punishment like spanking, grounding, and the like only has a lasting effect of fear or "if I do something wrong I get pain". Most people are able to overcome that fear after a while and just don't care about the punishment anymore.   This is coming from a guy who got whipped by a belt, thumped on the head, spanked, grounded, and humiliated. By the time I was 15, I just didn't care about that anymore. I kept my good grades because I was worried about my own future, it took will power to not drop my grades as a sign of rebellion to my parents because I really wanted to. I didn't want them to believe that their parenting helped me be who I was, but I decided the risk was too big for the tiny reward of self-satisfaction. I was lucky in that respect, because it seems the majority of teenagers go through with the rebellion and screw up their futures as a way of getting back at their parents.   I'm 23 now with a 4.0 in college currently and my degree in Biochemistry is coming along nicely. I STILL have that lingering feeling that I need to call my parents together to tell them that I am not successful because of their punishments. I cried at night sometimes because I just wanted them to tell me that they were proud of me, or that I did a good job, or at least reward me with a thank you. I still remember the ONE TIME when my father told me "thank you son" after I helped stop him from falling off of a ladder. Nothing changed after that, and I decided to dedicate my life to helping others through science. I'm humbled and know I'm lucky that the downwards spiral that I wanted to play out in my head didn't come to fruition like it does with most teens today. The only reason I don't yell at my parents is because it would do nothing but give me some self-satisfaction on the expense of them feeling as if I was a jerk or they had done something wrong in raising me.Summary:
I don't know what emotion is called when you feel when someone you really think is the main component of your life is crushing your heart by telling you that you've done something bad enough for you and maybe their education, but it's a powerful one that makes you wish you never to disappoint them again. On the other hand, punishment like spanking, solidification, and as it only has a lasting effect of fear or "if I do something wrong I get pain. Most people are able to overcome this fear after a while and just don't care anymore about punishment.
I don't know how the emotion is called that you feel if someone you really think that the main part of your life is to crush your heart by saying that you feel something wrong enough to make them feel bad about you and maybe their parents, but it is a powerful one that you can take a promise to never disappoint again. On the other hand, punishment such as spanking, grounding, and the same only has a lasting effect of fear or "if I get something wrong I pain". Most people are able to overcome this fear after a while and simply no longer care about the punishment. This is from a guy who was whipped by a belt, I believe on the head, spank out, and humiliated.
In fact, it depends on what you mean by punishment. To feel that someone you look up (that you want to take pride in your actions) is disappointed with you after one of your actions hurts. I don’t really know what the emotion is called that you feel when someone who really thinks that it is the main component of your life is crushing your heart by telling you that you did something wrong to make them feel bad about you and maybe your upbringing, but it’s a powerful one that makes you a vote yourself to never disappoint them again. On the other hand, punishment like spanking, earth, and as it only has a lasting effect of fear. or “If I do something wrong, it hurts me.” Most people are able to overcome that fear after a while and I only care about my punishment more. This comes from a guy who was whipped by a belt, like a blow on the head, left-handed on the head, left-handed in college, and humiliated my future that I also makes it missing their friends.
Summarize: 3000 is a lot of money to invest, when you've only read about the trails you plan to ride.   Just FYI- a tricked out bike does not make mountain biking possible, it only makes it easier to do it more efficiently. And this ONLY comes after the rider's necessary skills have already been honed. A noob is a noob, regardless of the rig they're on. In fact you may be cheating yourself of a valuable learning period by going with a bike that will 'do too much for you'.

Summarize: So there I was, in a game, jungling on my favorite champion in Solo Queue. Getting some damage from Orianna and Leona when Ori steals big wolf - NBD. No flaming on my end although I did kind of expect a little help at blue. Nothing from Ori. I "WTF'd" at that point, but Leona gave me a pretty beast leash so no biggie.   Anyway, the game goes on. The no-chat laneswap tells me Ori and Shen are duo, which is fine. Shen is doing well after the successful counter gank top lane for First Blood and a Double Kill. Bot Lane was kind of a blur for me. I mostly just remembered my interactions with top and mid.   Fast forward into mid game. We're ahead in kills but losing map presence. Leona makes a few  seemingly  crazy dives and I'm berated for not following in. I figured she was trying to throw the game after the failed Surrender she had initiated. Orianna constantly calling the lot of us bads and I'm just wondering where it all went wrong. It seems the Shen was kind of helpful in trying to let me know when to do things, but I was just trying to get past the Ori flame. Maybe I missed something insightful.   Game is lost. No surprise. Ori proceeds to state enemy top and mid lanes are trash (or something to that effect). Then the rage continues post-game. A few quickly duck out and I mimic shortly thereafter. Then I tried to go through what happened. Maybe these guys have some insight! Sure they will. The  game  is over. So I send a friend invite to 2 of the members from my former team and immediately get [this response]( back. I've only heard from one.   Why do people remain so salty after games? Did this person assume I'd start a flame war? This is only the first time I've tried talking to someone after a lost game, but only because four people had met the same general consensus that I was in the wrong on multiple occasions. Are people always this standoffish?Summary:

Summarize: I rarely lucid dream and last night was the first time in a few months so I was pretty excited. Anyway, after becoming lucid and walking around touching things for a bit I decided to make a girl I had seen in a dream earlier that night appear in front of me so we could, ya know..   Anyway I was standing in front of a table and chairs and I had no idea how to just make her appear so I picked up a towel that was next to me and dangled it in front of my face, hoping she would appear after I took it away like a magic trick or something. Didn't work. I tried again but this time I closed my eyes, then when I tried to open them I opened my real eyes :(   Shoulda just flown around or somethingSummary:

Summarize: Love all these comments that more or less say, "If you didn't want to work the holidays you shouldn't work in retail/shouldn't work for KMart" etc. Like oh pardon me I forgot to pick up my higher education at the degree store. I obviously forgot to order the job catalogue from Sears this year, my bad.   I'm gonna go ahead and assume these people are  not  low-income earners. Nobody  wants  to work at KMart. Like, "Oh Timmy, what do you want to do when you graduate?" "Actually, it's been my life-long dream to stock the K-Mart dairy aisle. I know I will get shit pay and never see my family on Christmas but hey, do what you love, love what you do!" You work there because you have to. Like most customer service jobs. You could leave K-Mart and go somewhere else and the exact same thing would happen to you; I work at Sport Chek in Canada and I'm not allowed to book time off anywhere from mid-November until January. Same thing for back to school. I could quit, but it would be much the same anywhere else. Look for a different job? Like what? You have to have open availability for  any  entry-level or seasonal position because they know they can treat you like shit and there's nothing you can do about it.

Summarize: I was playing at my first PTQ, which was Time Spiral sealed. My opponent and I are both 5-1, going into the crucial round that will determine who will make it into top 8 (top 8 gets an additional draft for single elimination).   We were on game 3, and neither of us have any major board advantage. His Errant Ephemeron unsuspends, and attacks me for 4, bringing me down to 7. On my turn, I topdeck a land (this is critical), and play Word of Seizing on his Ephemeron and smack him down to 7. I follow up with an Assassinate on his Ephemeron, and pass the turn. On his turn, he attacks me with an animated flying Totem - I'm down to 5. I topdeck another land, and contrary to what you may believe, this is what wins me the game.   "Disintegrate for 7." What happens next takes the entire room of 82 occupants by surprise.   "NOOOOOOOOOOOOOooooooooOOOOOoooo!"   Turns out, my opponent has been playing in PTQs for years, and this is the first time that he's ever come this close to making it to top 8. The guy is literally in tears, and all I can do is stay by the table to comfort him. Imagine me, a young high school kiddo who's at his first PTQ, taking down someone who has been waiting for this moment for ages. Feels bad.   Anyways, I end up being super giddy at the draft (getting a warning during picks because I am not used to the strictness of high level play), and win my first match on the back of the U 2/1 shadow with Undying Rage. I lose fairly quickly in the next round to a well built W/U deck, and go home happy with a Time Spiral booster box in my backpack.Summary:
Summarize: I honestly believe that the process of going through a pledging process that involves hazing is not as harmful as the effects it has on the person once he/she is initiated into the fraternity/sorority.   At least with the organization I was apart of what tended to happen was 1) "brotherhood" closeness was only really present among pledge class members rather than  throughout the whole frat (though by the time I left college, this was getting better), and 2) there was a constant perpetuation of the hazing with each new pledge class.   There's a lot of ways to describe #2 but in a nut shell the mentality was "if we had to go through this for our pledging, then so with the new guy." It was just frustrating for me to be continually butting heads with people who adamantly wanted to continue these practices for the sake of tradition despite the fact the amount of flack the frat could have received had the administration gotten word.   The worst part-we weren't even your stereotypical frat. In the frat system, there are two types: social (stereotypical) and professional (think the engineering frat). We hazed with quizzes, 24.7 scavenger hunts, and "character building." My friend in a social sorority said that one time when their pledges screwed up, they "punished" them with a night of girly drinks and the Victoria Secret fashion show with the other sisters.   Maybe I'm just jealous.Summary:
Summarize: I'm actually surprised by the statement that "this is becoming the norm". If you look at music, fashion and photography, the opposite is true. But it's like a bell-curve: it takes a while till the middle-part bleeds out.   .   Please note, my post is going to sound pretty judgmental - but I'm not judging. It's a representation of how trends move through the global society, where trends are often set in the most affluent parts, and gradually move through society.   .   A few years ago, the top photographers (whether it be wedding or fashion) went for this ultra-processed look with HDR, supersaturation, etc. It was a photographers way of showing he had good equipment and post-processing skills. The photos had the word "digital" stamped on top of it. Because digital was hot, money was cool, and there was a global the-more-the-better mentality. Around 1995, things changed.   If you look at trends in fashion (fashion itself, not photography), people became tired of this glamorous, sparkly, over-the-top style. This actually has everything to do with the economy going down too: no more sparkly Louis Vuitton bags, but denim, beards, lumberjack-shirts and wool sweaters became the norm. Everyone's going bankrupt, or afraid of going bankrupt, so it's now about showing virtue, stability and sensibility.   It's a psychological effect of economic highs and lows, and there are plenty of articles written on the effects of the macro-economy and trends in fashion, music and photography/art.   This trend of "normalization" is also true in photography. In fashion-photography, the ring-flash and the straight-on, almost washed out look became more and more common.  Instagram became big, and people liked the shitty "normal-looking" photos. VSCO became superpopular in wedding photography - giving photos an analog look with lifted blacks, and a feeling of "genuinely".   .   It's a cyclical move, back to the analog days, back to the denim days, back to the acoustic days.   So, regarding the unrealistic photos becoming the norm, I only see two groups who use this style: some really really popular wedding photographers, who adapted this style 10 years ago and can't switch because they're chosen for it - mostly by affluent couples who aren't afraid to show of their wealth or who are chosen for this style by culture (Indian weddings tend to be really colourful, so they're sticking with the style), other photographers who are either "impressing by post" (although the vsco-look, dipped blacks and such is also impressing by post), weddingphotographers who have non-affluent couples but who want to live the (10-year-old) dream and starting photographers. The second group are people who are culturally bound to be in the middle of the bell-curve, since any new styles moves "down" trough society and culture, or from right to left on the bell-curve.   .   So, it's probably not a popular opinion, but the opposite to your statement is true. The peak of this style has already passed, but it has to move through the steps of society and culture. It'll stay popular in the medium-income groups and "2nd world cultures" for a while. It's like music: rap-music is still popular in mainstream, but its glorydays are far gone. Styles like chillstep and acoustic indie are what's "hot and rising", and it's getting kinda mainstream (or "pop-culture") but it's not there yet.Summary:
If you look at music, fashion and photography, it's true. But it's like a bell curve: it takes a while until the middle part bleeds.. Note that my post will seem pretty critical - but I don't judge. It's a representation of how trends move through global society, where trends are often put in the most affluent parts, and gradually through society.. A few years ago, high-level photographers (whether it's marriage or fashion) went for this ultra-processed look with HDR, supersaturation, etc. It was a way to show that he had good equipment and post-treatment skills.

In fact, I am surprised by the statement that "this is becoming the norm." If you look at music, fashion and photography, the opposite is true. But it is like a bell curve: it takes a while until the middle part bleeds out.. Please, keep in mind, my post will sound quite critical - but I am not judging. It is a representation of how trends move across global society, where trends are set in the richest parts, and little by little move through society.. A few years ago, the best photographers (whether wedding or fashion) went away for this ultra-processed look with HDR, supersaturation, etc. It was a way of photographers to show that it only had good equipment and post-processing skills.. The photos had the word "retrodigital" stamped in the top of fashion. Because digital was hot, the money was great, and the fashion of science became more popular.
Summarize: no frankly the onus is on you to prove why game change would be an improvement on the game. On it's face it seems pointlessly complicated for no actual gain. The fact that this is not self evident to you makes me question whether we are even playing the same game.  The liberator thing is essentially a null point as most people will pull them from the warpgate anyway, and since they don't disable people pulling tanks from the warpgate whether they have a a techplant or not i really can't see them not applying special restrictions on aircraft. The max thing makes even less sense.   Max's are 1) Essential as an anti-air platform.. 2) Balanced in that they have a cooldown time 3) Balanced in that they have a resource cost 40 Balanced in what vehicles they can ride in 5) Balanced in that they cannot take points.   You have to make a strong case for changing them to be taken seriously as an argument. "I've had way more success with heavy assault than MAXes in biolabs." Is not evidence because it's not even typical.Summary:

Summarize: A friend of mine and I were talking about expectations we have of other people and how that relates to love and dating. We talked about how after meeting a girl, or even just seeing her for the first time, it's so easy to obsess over her. She's beautiful and intelligent and perfect and she totally dominates your thoughts. But at the end of the day, you don't really  know  them. You know  of  them, and every thing else you think you know was created by your mind to be the best of the best ideal scenario. You have to separate your rational thoughts from the hopes you have. Then we talked about the song Vermillion Pt. 2 by Slipknot, and how in this context, the line "She isn't real. I can't make her real" couldn't apply more perfectly. What  you  want probably doesn't exist, because you created it.Summary:

Summarize: I feel like there's not being enough done to address the source of the issue, by the time an SJW is an SJW and starts abusing whatever power they have in sexist, racist and bigoted ways it's far too late in some respects, you can put up a resistance to the changes they propose and argue on merit (I feel like that's most of what is happening currently) however I want to address the problem closer to the root of it myself.   So stepping back for a second looking at how all this starter the gamers are dead articles, a significant amount of gaming "journalists" abused their power and essentially shit on their audience to push their narrative and ideology onto their readers, although we didn't know at the time the ideology they were driven by was social justice. Once they were challenged in the open and their ad hominem attacks were overused to the point where they were completely ineffective they were forced to update their ethics policies and lost the majority of the sway they once had and I'd argue a market change is in progress that will replace the vast majority of them. In my mind the games journalism front has been won, but during that battle we discovered the problem wasn't coming from nor limited to gaming journalism.   We discovered pretty much the entirety of the left leaning news media was cut from the same cloth as these people and pushing narrative over fact and just not bothering to fact check stories and just repeatedly pushing their ideologically driven agenda, the right leaning media not being much better but was just pushing a different agendas ideology. The mainstream media I'd argue is the battle currently being fought, with distrust of it at an all time high outright manipulation and censorship not to mention poor fact checking being constantly revealed I feel like eventually this one will be won too but it will take significantly more time. However where are all these ideologues coming from? Academia.   So it became quite evident that these ideologues in the media were coming from colleges and universities that have been indoctrinating their students in these social justices courses which are essentially marxism with some minor variations, some even starting as early as highschool. This is the earliest source of the problem that has been identified during all of this, this seems to be the next battle ground with Sargon of Arkkad leading the charge, this is good and something that needs to be done about students being indoctrinated in this ideology but this isn't the battle I want to fight I feel like the source of this issue is even farther back.   While the SJW ideology is currently the dominant one it wasn't always Christianity was once the predominant one and it wasn't until Christianity was defeated that new ideologies started to take it's place. Feminism, social justice(new aged marxism), otherkin and other equality insane ideologies started to prosper once Christianity was defeated and then social justice started absorbing them all and became the dominant ideology. But why did this happened? Why did when one set of bullshit ideas get defeated did another one just pop up and takes it's place? It's because nature abhors a vacuum and Christianity wasn't replaced with anything, so social justice ended up replacing it. If Social Justice is defeated like Christianity was I fear that a new insane ideology would simply take it's place and the battle would be reset. So what is the root of the problem? What solution could there possibly be?   There are two potential solutions to this dilemma I have come up  with. One being replace the ideology with one that isn't dangerous or detrimental to social and scientific progress, we could make up our own ideology or find an existing one that isn't that bad like Buddhism or Shinto. Personally I don't like this option, I feel it would take constant maintenance and require us to essentially do the thing we hate because it's what's best for everyone and we all know how well that usually turns out. So what's the other option? I look at the people who haven't been taken in by this bullshit and I notice a common trend, critical thinking, I think we need to replace these ideologies with critical thinking, if kids learned strong critical thinking skills at a young age I believe that no other insane ideology would be able to take root in their minds, attempts at indoctrination simply would not work.   So the next problem how do we teach kids critical thinking, reforming elementary and highschool education in this way seems like a battle worth fighting but it's not in my skillset, if it is in yours I implore you to pursue it to the best of your abilities. My plan however is different. I feel a tool for teaching critical thinking skills has been under our noises this whole time, I believe there is a reason this resistance was strongest in the gaming community and not in academy or even the atheist community, games require critical thinking you cannot get through a good game without applying atleast some critical thought, so that's the path I've chosen to pursue personally, creating games that promote critical thinking that kids can play, what do you think of my ideas?Summary:
Summarize: I have the impression that there is not enough to address the source of the issue, at a time when a SJW is a SJW. This case is to abuse any power they have in sexist, racist and fanatical ways, it is far too late in some respects, you can put resistance to the changes they propose and argue on merit (I have the impression that this is most of what is happening at the moment) but I want to address the problem closer to the root of it myself.
The publication of this release is not only the fact that the media is not doing enough to address the source of the problem until this SJW is an SJW and begins to abuse what power they have in sexist, racist and bogoted ways it is much too late in some ways, you can oppose the changes they propose and argue about merit (I feel like that's most of what is happening at the moment) but I want the problem closer to the root of itself. So step back for a second look at how all these starters the gamers are dead articles, a significant amount of gaming "journalists" have been abused to the point where they were totally ineffective they were forced to push their history and ideology to their readers, although we did not know at the time the ideology they were driven was social justice. Once they were in the open challenge and their ad-hominem attacks were to the point where they simply replaced the publication of the release of publications.
However, when a SJW is a SJW and begins to abuse whatever power they have in sexist, racist and fanatical forms, it is too late in some respects, you can resist the changes they propose and argue about merit (I feel that this is what is happening most to them today), however, I want to address the problem closer to the root of myself. So by spending a second seeing how this whole principle players are dead items, a significant number of "journalists" of gambling abused their power and basically shit in their audience to push their narrative and ideology over their readers, although we did not know at the time that the ideology that they were driven by this social justice.
Summarize: So a few nights ago the band I play in spent the day doing a video shoot for an upcoming single. After a very long day and getting back very late we were all somewhat exhausted and decided to leave our gear in the van over night. You can probably guess where this is going... The van one if our guitarists uses for work was stolen along with a hell of a lot of gear from outside his house in Knebworth, Hertfordshire. It would be massively appreciated if we could ask people from the UK to help us out by keeping their eyes and ears open for the van or any gear being shifted anywhere.

Summarize: In April of last year one of my close friends committed suicide.  We went out the night before, and had a blast before this buddy got rejected, got into a fight, and the night spiraled out of control.  Around noon the next day I went to check on him at his basement apartment.  I walked down the stairs and heard extremely loud reggae music blasting from his stereo.  I banged on the door for a solid ten minutes, during which time I heard the toilet flush (so I knew he was in there/alive).  I figured he didn't want to see me, so I left with a bad feeling.  The fact that I KNEW something was wrong but did nothing to help him has haunted me since that night in April, and the image of the door I should have kicked in will always be with me.Summary:
Summarize: I write a lot of library code and I can't say I've ever had a problem with this.  You generally have a pretty good feel for what methods need to be virtual when you're writing the base class anyway (assuming you take the time to think that part through).  About the only time I find myself needing to go back and make something virtual in a base class is when the functionality of that class is being seriously reworked.Summary:
Summarize: Hi. First time posting on reddit. First of all, I'm sorry for the grammar and mispells, english isn't my native language. And sorry if I make any mistake.   So, I met this girl in 2010. We were kids, basically(13 years old, both of us). We were close to each other, she liked books, I liked books, we had some interests in common. I'll just try to summarize everything. In 2011, I fell in love with her. I had never fallen in love with someone the way I fell with her. So I told her, and we started a relationship(yes, we had 15 years old, I know, some will say it's nothing important). At first, she was with me just to forget a boy she had been having feelings for, but after some months, she truly started to love me.   So we got very close. She had very serious self-esteem problems and I was the person that helped her the most. Some would say she's fat; I say she's perfect. I just love her, you know? The point is, we were really, really close to each other. We spent all day long talking to each other, and every weekend, we would go out to see movies.   Thing is, in the end of 2013, I got some doubts about my feelings. It wasn't the first time, and she noticed it. So she broke up with me, wanting to give me time to think about my love for her. I ended up not wanting to get back with her, when she came to talk to me again after 2 months(February 2014). It's the biggest regret I have. Really, the thing that I want the most is just to go back in time and not let her go away. It was really bad for her, but she had her friends and her family, and she travelled to a foreign country, so thinking about me wasn't something she would do all the time.   So, after 4 months of our breakup(April, 2014), she searched me again, wanting a "friend with benefits" type of relationship. Yes, we had had sexual activities. Nothing really serious, two young persons knowing each other. So I accepted because... I liked to be with her. And I ended up falling in love with her again, and she still loved me, so we got back together. And I thought that this time it was serious.   Wasn't. I mean, it was serious. But just not as strong as before. She started to get distant. I always had to search for her, she almost never looked for me. Watching her TV series seemed to be more important for her than I was. She wouldn't charge her cellphone, so I couldn't talk with her. I'm very possessive, I admit. I don't like to stay one day without talking with her; it just makes me nervous. I don't know.   So, I felt like I was loving her, but she wasn't loving me back. She kept telling me that she did love me, she was just different. And I believed her. I thought that I just had to get used to not getting so much attention.   Two weaks ago, she broke up with me. One day before our last year of school began. It wasn't a agressive breakup, because I understood her point. She still loves me, and I know it. Our connection is really strong. But she loves me as a friend. Something like that. Aaand, she felt feelings for the boy that she was trying to forget when we started dating. So... I really wouldn't like to be with her knowing she liked another guy.   I'm trying to move on. But I still love her. Like, I really don't have any will to live without her. I totally understand we HAD to breakup, things weren't working out. But I miss her. And I'm young, and I know I have a lot to live. Still... It's hard, without her. It's really hard to wake up, knowing I won't have her with me. And I see her everyday, because of school.   And what kills me is that she's fine. She's moving on. In some time, she will probably know another guy. And I wont be the last anymore. She's fine, and i'm just... I don't have a place to go. I don't have anyone to talk to. I'm just alone. Loneliness is killing me.   And I feel it's my fault. If I hadn't broken up with her the first time, if I could just love her and stop being stupid, things would the fine now. She would still love me.   I really don't know if I made it clear to you what the situation was. I'm sorry, i'm really confused too... Thank you for reading.Summary:
I had a little time with her. I had a little time with her. I had a little time with her. I had a little time with her. I had a little time with her, I had her with her, I had her with her, I had her with her, I had her with her, I had her with her, I had her with her, I had her with her, I had her with her, I had her with her, I had her with her, I had her with her, I had her with her, I had a little time with her, I had a little time with her, I had a little time with her, I had a little time with her, I had a little time with her, I had a little time with her, I had a little time with her, I had a little time with her, I had a little time with her, I had a little time with her, I had a little time with her and I had a little time with her.

Summarize: I cant be the only one who just didn't play launch night because the got tired of a bugged prologue after 2 hours. And now I'm posting after wasting time replaying the prologue and then all the end cut scenes were completely black due to another bug. What a waste of time, Gearbox should expect some people to have played the beta and expect some people to not need a tutorial. If I wanted story I would have picked the prologue, and as much as I appreciate Gearbox's humor I wish I had that time back. Don't corner me with this unskippable bullshit. And the best part is those who actually liked the prologue could choose to do it, if they wished and I could have quit out and ignored it after trying it.Summary:

Summarize: Hello everyone! I'm kinda new here ,but i had read most of the latest post ,that made me feel a bit better in my situation,so thank you all for sharing your stories!   Me and my girlfriend were together for almost 3 years ,in april i broke up with her because of a stupid reason,the reason that she goes at university at 180km away (not the only reason but mainly,she was also feeling very quilty when we had minorargues for nothing and couldn't study after because she was crying and couldn't focus). I thought (i was wrong though) that breaking up would be better for her. It wasn't. From here everything went downhill,she was feeling down and there was this colleague of her that was in love with her and he persuaded her into sleeping with him.(he offered her attention and she fell for it).There are some more things between but we got over mostly.   I just feel disappointed that she could do it,even if she's so naive(i always told her that,now she believes me :) )         Anyway,i was with other girl [1 girl,1 time] as well (after she was with that guy 2 more times ),we both felt how is it to be apart and we know that we care about eachother and want to be together. The problem is that she got into the medical university and that's 180km away and the university takes 6 years to complete,on the other side,there's me .. i'm also at university but in this city and i'll end it in 3 years.   I really want her in my life,not as a friend and i'm thinking about this  middle  distance relationship.I don't think it would be that hard since we both passed 2-3 months without seeing eachother after breakup and made some improvements on ourselves (i communicate much better than before and she's working on her naivete hope i got it right ).   We could see eachother probably every other weekend (once every 2 or 3 weeks probably) ,i have a car so it's easy for me to go there,i can even take the train.   The last problem is my trust in her,that guy she slept with is there at university as well,she told me that she was foolish,naive and didn't intend to do that to me.She regrets all of it,i know her and i feel that she doesn't lie now.She's been crying her heart out last days when i saw here because of the mistakes she did. I asked her how I know she won't go to that guy again and she said ,if you don't believe me i'll show you,just wait and you'll see.I'm thinking that she really decided not to go with anyone else until i decide (even if she starts university already) .So I don't have to worry to much but still...   Finally, my question is should we try and make this relationship long distance? Maybe there are people here who share similar stories and i really hope someone can give some advice.Summary:

I and my girlfriend were together for almost 3 years, in April I broke up with her for a stupid reason, the reason she went to college 180 km away, it wasn't the only reason, but mainly, she also felt very padded when we had minor problems for nothing and couldn't study later because she was crying and couldn't concentrate. I thought (I was wrong though) that breaking it would be better for her. It wasn't like that. From here everything was downhill, she felt lower and there was this colleague of her who was in love with her and he convinced her to sleep with him. (He offered me his attention and she fell for her). There are some more things between college but we even did beyond what she is beyond the relationship.

Summarize: We have been together for about two years, in the beginning the kid was okay, then when me and my boyfriend had started having some trouble he just automatically hated me (super immature) and literally just wouldnt talk to me, was a complete jerk right to my face.   this past summer we broke up for just about the summer and then decided to get back together. during that time he literally slept over and spent every SINGLE DAY with this kid... they are 26 years old..   now that we are back together i dont hesitate to say something when his friend pisses me off, but he literally never sees it. when i bring something up he'll either brush it off and defend his friend saying "thats just how he is, thats why he doesnt have a girlfriend" or "ive already said something to him about it a million times" but he will NEVER defend me in front of his friend...   is it just me or is this relationship a bit extreme? and i am not the only one who thinks this, all of the friends that we hang out with think their relationship is pretty weird and they are together and texting ALL the time.. i know people have their best friends and shit, but am i wrong for being pissed off when he doesnt defend me or say something to the kid?Summary:
Summarize: Here's a chart describing the training categories. This is VERY helpful, let me know if you need a hand interpreting it.   "Training volume is the amount of work that is performed. Many coaches and athletes use the number of miles or kilometers covered as the measure of training volume. While this is an acceptable measure it does not always give the full picture of training. For example if athlete A does a 20 km workout in 90 minutes and athlete B covers the same 20 km in 60 minutes they are not doing the same workout and won’t get the same training effect even though the volume as measured by distance is the same. Time is a better measure of training volume as it is allows athletes of varying level to be compared on an equal level." -that excerpt is from this document,  , about halfway down.   I used to have the "faster is always better" mentality when I ran in high school. I would push myself to finish a 5 or 10k faster than the previous time I ran it. I think that's acceptable if you're working out like "the average Joe" (ie. 3-5x a week), but when you're training like an endurance athlete you really have to start thinking about what your body can recover from and what will cause the most desirable adaptations.   Another important thing to note about steady state is that your numbers  will  improve over time. If, let's say, right now you can hold a 2:09 average for the piece at a 155 heart rate, and you keep doing the same steady state piece ~4 times a week, in a month you'll notice that you can hold a (guesstimating here) 2:04 at the same heart rate. This means that your body is getting more efficient, becoming able to perform more work while expending less effort than before.   I'm not saying that there's no place in a training plan for a firm pressure longer piece every now and then. A common test that is done with rowers is an hour of power (exactly what it sounds like— an hour-long test that is usually rate-capped in order to produce more powerful strokes), or a 30-minute test rate-capped at 20. Try doing a 30 minute piece at a low rate in which you see if you can stay under 2:00 the whole time (again, just ball-parking in regards to splits here), but only do this once a week or so. These pieces are helpful because they have you hold a higher heart rate (~175) for a longer duration, which is very taxing, to see if you can withstand it.Summary:
This is a work plan that is not very useful, but is not an acceptable measure, but does not always give a complete picture of the training. For example, if the athlete did a 20 km training in 90 minutes and the athlete B covered the same 20 km in 60 minutes, they did not do the same work and did not have the same training effect even if the volume measured by distance was the same. Time is a better measure of the training volume as it allows athletes of varying levels to be compared to an equal level.
This is very helpful, let me know if you need to interpret a hand. "Training volume is the amount of work that is done. Many coaches and athletes use the number of miles or kilometers covered as a measure of training volume. Although this is an acceptable measure, there is not always the full picture of training. For example, if Athlete A makes a 20 km training in 90 minutes and Athlete B covers the same 20 km in 60 minutes they do not receive the same training and won-t get the same training effect, even if the volume as measured by the distance is the same. Time is a better level of training volume as it is that athletes of different levels can be compared to a same level." -That extract from this document, about half down. I used to "faster is getting better" mentality when I ran in high school. I would push myself to make a 5 or 10k faster than the previous time I did it to do that the same number of work is acceptable if you "the average Joe" (ie give a good exam.
This is VERY useful, let me know if you need a manual interpretation. "The training volume is the amount of work that is done.

For example, if athlete A does a training of 20 km in 90 minutes and athlete B covers the same 20 km in 60 minutes they are not doing the same training and will not get the same training effect even though the volume measured by the distance is the same.

Summarize: I wasn't able to log in earlier today. What would happen was I would click the Hearthstone shortcut and instead of opening I would get an error message saying something along the lines of:   "Required battle.net data could not be found"   After trying to delete my cache and trying to run as admin, I tried to move the "Hearthstone" and "Battle.net" folders from "Program Files (x86)" to "Program Files". This fixed everything and the game is running fine now.   Just wanted to let you all know about this :)Summary:

Summarize: Jimi Hendrix.   Explanation: I was in Vietnam. Okay, full disclosure: I  was  Vietnam. You know that bandanna-wearing junkie who took a bullet to the leg and rants about the decline of America and all the stuff he saw? That was me. I was him. I can’t say it’s a particularly pleasant experience, but at least I always know how to respond in conversations. For instance:   GUY: Would you like paper or plastic?   ME: Paper, please.   GUY: So how’s your day been so far?   ME: (Awkward silence, as I try to remember what I did that day, and remember that I spend most of it masturbating)   ME: I shot kids. Dozens. Hundreds maybe. They’re dead now. I watched their little Agent Orange heads fall off. It was me, man. It was all me.   When I got back from the war I thought I could  change  things. Like in that movie, Mr. Smith Goes To Washington, where Robin Williams plays a teenage senator from the Bronx who’s up against big-business leader and small-time coke dealer Joe Paine (portrayed by an aging Demi Moore). Does anyone else here think that Robin Williams’ best movie was Night at the Museum 2? I don’t claim that it deserves an Academy Award, but the man has some acting chops. The Teddy Roosevelt squid-rape scene ranks in my top ten favorites, all-time.   Also worth noting: I am  synesthetic,  a condition which means that I see backwards in time. But I also live backwards chronologically, so it ends up cancelling out. It’s a little like rewinding one side of a VHS tape when you meant to fast forward the other. It hasn’t really altered my life in any spectacular way, but my doctor (who’s also my golf buddy and frequently lures unsuspecting teens into his house for a “sandwich”) gives me little green pills which are supposed to reduce the effects but actually just turn the world purple and give me the ability to kill people with my eye sockets. As you might expect, this has been a real game-changer.   So I guess what I’m saying it, appreciate the time you have. Love your wife and kids. Have a beer with your buddies and talk about the old times. You never know when it’s going to all be swept away in a torrent of lies/semen.Summary:

If you listen to older music, (I'm guessing) it was mastered for people who predominantly didn't have access to decent home entertainment and while there's a difference it's not as stark.

Summarize: I thought I would add this comment that might help. The Sub is not about POUNDING off bass frequencies, although it does this. It’s more about the cross between small speakers that simply can’t play lower frequencies and bigger speakers than they can. What you’re buying is not a ‘gun trash’ but details.

Summarize: My husband and I have always disagreed about whether to spank our kids. When our oldest was a baby, it was all hypothetical, and he (somewhat reluctantly) agreed with my perspective that we should not spank. My reasoning is that there is no other situation where it is appropriate to hit someone in order to obtain their compliance/obedience, so why is it okay to do so with a child? Both of us were spanked as kids, with different results-- he was unfazed, but I became fearful of my mom. So naturally, he is not as opposed to an occasional spank.   Now that our daughter is almost 3, she's really testing us. She also has a new little brother who is 3 months old. Her behavior was INSANE when we first brought him home, but she's mostly returned to normal at this point. At this point, I think her increase of sassiness and defiance is a natural part of being her age rather than a reaction to her brother. We want to address it and teach her to be respectful, obedient, etc but disagree on the method in which to do so.   A couple months ago, she started trying to run away from us in public, so I agreed that we could give her a smack on the hand if she did something very dangerous, like running from us or running towards the street. We have each done so once or twice, and it seems to have made an impression on her. She hasn't tried to run in maybe a month, which is great.   Now my husband wants to spank her as a part of regular discipline, not just the dangerous situations. In fact, he "popped" her yesterday and told me about it afterwards, which upset me of course. He apologized for doing so without talking to me first but he said that he thinks we need to start spanking her. She is a sweet, funny, and extremely intelligent girl, but these days she is constantly pushing limits, directly disobeying, negotiating, being sassy/rude, and all kinds of behaviors that are not okay. I know it's normal but we do need to address them somehow before things get out of hand.   She's very energetic, and it's within the realm of possibility that she has ADHD-- I know she's too young for a diagnosis, nor do I want one at this age, but my husband has ADHD himself and she's wayyyy more energetic and wild compared to peers of her own age. So just out of curiosity I googled "ADHD and spanking" and came across this article:   I know this is only one person's opinion, but now I'm confused. Maybe spanking is what she needs. I'm just not sure. If spanking her now will help her learn to control herself and avoid behavior problems in the future, maybe we should do it. I just can't get over the feeling that it's wrong to use physical discipline/hitting simply because she's my child.   Am I overthinking this? I know there are studies about the detriments of spanking, but I've also heard that they typically study extreme cases of abuse and explosive, unpredictable discipline rather than controlled and rational spanking, so I don't know how relevant all of that is either.

Keep in mind no matter how hard your work or how much time you put into it you aren't that Oscar before you're 25 if you don't have a genuine passion for the art of film and filmmaking.   I'm not saying you don't have passion, you clearly do, but I firmly believe that you have to be willing to let the work be its own reward, and potentially give up the oscar in favor of making a film that you are happier with.  I know a guy who's directed a ton of shorts and had an internship in LA and is probably one of the most disciplined filmmakers I knew.  He got the drive, but he doesn't explore his art, and his films suffer for it.   PM me if you need help with any post production/animation!Summary:
Summarize: Hi all, I am not some grandmaster MOBA player but I have been playing the genre for four years or so now. Here are some basic tips about playing a MOBA, these can easily be the difference between being bronze and getting up to Gold+ ranking.     Don't chase a kill under tower. If they get away, fine. Just pressuring an opponent out of lane is a big advantage because you will get more xp and cp then they will.     Let the minion waves push closer to your tower. Forcing the opponent to have to stand far away from their tower will allow roamers/junglers to gank your lane. And this will give you safe csing. Early game especially, unless you are doing a 5 man push, don't be too aggressive with the minion wave.     Don't use abilities to last hit unless necessary. Conserve your ability power until it is needed. Late game you can clear a wave if necessary with an ult or other ability, but early game you want to last in lane longer than your opponent.     Last hit minions! Paragon is a bit tricky with last hitting but this should be your goal. Don't spam auto-attack and abilities, instead be patient, strategies who you hit and always be ready to get a last hit in.     Hitting minions > hitting lane opponent. Get a pod shot in here and there if possible on opponent but never at the sacrifice of missing cp. If the opponent is dumb and allows you to keep hitting them that can be advantageous because they will have to retreat, but remember those last hits!     Hide behind your own  minions. This will prevent the opponent from hitting you with skill shots. Move back and forth, keep cover if possible.     Do not push a lane past mid point without backup. Seriously just don't. Even if you think you can get in a few hits on the tower it is not worth dying for, you will die, someone is always in the jungle coming your way. If you push the wave past midpoint, look at the map where you can help, or port back and build up an item.     Don't wait too long to port back, infact if you have 3 points and the wave is pushed/even then port back, that extra power will  help a lot in fights.     Don't forget harvesters. Also you can kill jungle monsters especially the easy 2 camps.     Watch the mini-map, 60% of your attention at any time should be watching the mini-map. It will tell you where the opponent is, where the minions waves are...if someone is sneaking an inhibitor because the rest of your team is chasing kills.     If the opponent gets the ORB do not try to 1v5, group up with team, your not a hero, don't pretend to be a hero, you'll just die and be cussed at.       I am sure there are more tips, to sum it upSummary:

Summarize: The current campaign my group is going through is run by two dm's and while it is an intriguing story line thy benefits from the two o them colaborating.

If you are set on using the dm method the duties are split with combat along the lines of stat keeping (health and status ailments) and movement and strategy of the monsters.

Summarize: I was paid $100 by a bipolar mother to clean her severely mentally ill son's room and clean the viruses from his computer.   This kid was messed up, like, when finished eating a bowl of cereal he would just drop it on the floor. Milk and all. We put on gloves and threw away all of his shit, ignoring his protest.   I stumbled upon a folder labelled "homework", which was a red flag as he had dropped out of high school. More forboding, the folder was about 115 GB, taking up 70% of his HDD.   Upon opening it my jaw just dropped. It was nothing but CP. Not modeling pictures, but vile shit with titles like "6 year old whore Nancy brutally gangraped by daddy.avi". As I scrolled down, it was clear that this mentally ill teen was in possession of most of the child pornography traded in America. In a subfolder, there was txt files describing diary entries of how he molested his niece when she was 4, and brutally sadistic fantasies that I am nauseated even thinking about.   I wanted to just call the police. He would be tried as an adult and beaten and sexually abused for the rest of his life in a federal pen. I ended up telling his mother what I found, and if she did not send him away and deal with his sexual sadism, and APD + other severe mental issues, I would. I took a screenshot and scrubbed his PC. He became agitated and screamed and cried like a toddler when he was able to get onto his PC when I was done.   I've never told anyone this, but that night, we caught him masturbating over my (very buff) friend's cot. We beat him, beat him senseless. I had never been on the giving end of such a brutal beating before but it felt good, good that this monster was feeling even a fraction of what he fantasized about doing to little girls and boys.   When he stopped begging for his life (he had urinated on himself and was barely conscious), I went downstairs while my friend (whose daughter was molested) continued kicking and borderline torturing the guy. I told his mother what happened. She apologized, said she was sending him off in the morning, and paid us $140 each. She cried, but she didn't seem upset that we hurt her son. Like she knew what a monster he was and wished we had put him down.Summary:
Summarize: I'm about to get out of the military and with that I'll have the opportunity to go to school (almost) literally anywhere I want. I grew up fly fishing the waters of Western PA and I have an affinity for them based on familiarity and nostalgic value. I'm researching schools and was wondering what experiences and opinions my fellow brother's of the angle /redditors had to share. Obviously, with myself being a PA resident, Penn State is quite high on my list (Nearby Spring Creek, among others, is well known for its trout fishing). So, in yinz's opinion-- and regardless of whether or not you actually attended the University, where would you go if you had the opportunity to pursue higher education with the added convenience of great fly fishing nearby.Summary:

Summarize: When I run the wipers it smears, but only on the downward wipe. I thought it was the wiper itself, but then I got in the car after a bit of rain and saw this: [what is this!?](   I thought it was some wax or something from the car wash, so I tried cleaning it with glass cleaner and scrubbing the shit out of it, but it wont go away.   Any ideas? I tried to replace the wipers tonight, but they seem to use some new fangled adapter I've never seen before (2012 Fiesta), which wouldn't work with the new wipers I bought.Summary:

Summarize: My girlfriend and I both attend college, and we're on our Christmas break. All but two of her friends from high school have gone to different schools, and she says she has trouble making new friends in college. She still does have people to hang out with though.   Over the break, she's been hanging with her friends and blowing me off quite often. Today, she texted me asking what I was doing. She went on to say she was bored. I said let's hang out. She said she wanted something to do, not to just sit around. I suggested the park, she said it was too wet, then told me she was going to hang with her friend and 'maybe' we'd meet later. She ended up bailing on me. We've hung out and had good times this break, but sometimes I feel ignored. I feel like I'm a backup.   I understand that she misses her friends and she wants to take advantage of the break to see them, but she hangs out with them almost every day and doesn't seem to want to make time for me. I feel like she only hangs out with me if her friends are unavailable. And when we do hang out, it's often with her family. We have had little alone time.   Some supporting information: at school, we hang out almost every day. We've both told each other 'I love you.' The relationship was great ever since this break started. This break is a month long and I'd say 70 percent of it has been spent with her friends; which is why I feel like she could make a little bit of time for me. When I tell her how I feel she says she knows she has the whole school year to spend time with me and that she does miss hanging out with me, but it never seems genuine.     **Summary:

Summarize: Currently high-school seniors, both virgins. We've known each other for 2 years and have been dating for 2-3 months and things are great. We're in love for sure. We both happen to be going to the same college, same major even.   Our only issue is that she's very Christian and does not want 2nd base until marriage and I'm non-religious/agnostic. I don't mind waiting until marriage for sex, but I do want to go further than kissing sometime during college.   Dating in college is much more serious in her eyes, and she believes that this disagreement we have about sex and religion will lead to us naturally breaking up.Summary:

When I told my boyfriend that I was pregnant I was expecting him to encourage me to have an abortion, which is what I am wanting but didn't feel right about just doing it and not telling him first.  The reaction I got was the complete opposite.  He is happy about it and was mad that I would want to abort it.   I'm not ready to be a mother.  I have just started college and I really want to finish it and start a career before having a family.  This is his last year of college,  he has a college job but nothing yet for afterwords.  I really think this is a bad time for either of us to start a family.   Is it wrong for me to still want an abortion even though he wants the child.

Summarize: I doubt this will happen, but an idea occurred to me the other day.  It's been suggested, though debated, that the "teacher" Dominic mentioned, the one who inspired him to greatness by talking about all infinity being contained in a circle, is actually Finch, from his stint as a substitute teacher in a former episode.   Now, again, this has been debated, as Dominic seems too old for Finch's class, and he used it talk about Venn Diagrams, not pi.  But I realized that the "number" from that episode, Caleb, who Finch also inspired, was a budding drug dealer himself.   I wonder if the writers were already thinking ahead at this point, and already planning the rise of the Brotherhood, with Caleb, not Dominic, as the new rising lion.  A hacker drug lord, already aware of Finch and Reese, would make a formidable opponent.  Actually this would have been a really cool plot twist, before we knew who "Dominic" really was.   But even if not, what if Caleb were to come back as someone to oppose Dominic?  Picture: Finch's two students, battling for the city.  The Anti-Dominic, if you will.Summary:

Summarize: Was in a sex shop. Toward the back it said, "Tonights show is free to enter." So my SO and I strolled in. I expected it to be some kind of peep show you slip money under the window for. After all we were in Vegas. So we get in and turn the corner. There was a cheap porn flick playing on a huge screen. White chairs lining the room and last but certainly not least, guys (truck drivers) blowing each other on the chairs that were being used. When they saw us dicks were shoved back in thier pants. Yeah we walked about.Summary:

Summarize: So last month I  broke up with my boyfriend we were at the mall and I took his hand I told him how much he meant to me and how the past 2 years have been great, but there's someone else.   But I feel really bad for him, I see him around campus sometimes and he looks really sad and lonely, when we broke up for some reason our friends stuck with me and ditched him.   It was not even a bad breakup, to make thing's worse my new BF will yell things at him to I don't know piss him off he will call him farm boy, farm slave, farm homo.   (he grew up on a farm and he came to the big city I guess to study medicine, he does not really have anyone here)   I have told him to fucking stop it and he always argues " your my girlfriend stop sticking up for your ex" and we get into huge arguments about it and I am seriously on the verge of dumping his ass.   I am even saw him at a campus party and he tried talking to people, but because my new boyfriend is like really popular around here and I think they know him they blew him off.   But the main thing is, is their anything you can do for your ex to make them feel better. because it's not like he is not trying to move on, it just seems like the universe is fucking with him and not letting himSummary:
Summarize: Here is a link to the original post:   And here is the original comment made by /u/SQ_Minion, in all it's glorious entirety:   >Okay, I'm going to indulge in a bit of end-of-series literary analysis, specifically in regards to the final scene of this episode:   >Firstly, and most obviously, the whole thing is literally rose-colored; Oreki, for the first time, wants a rose-colored life instead of the gray existence of energy conservation he's chosen up until this point. The cherry blossoms, apart from independently being a traditional symbol of a new beginning or a rebirth, also hearken back to the first scene of the first episode, the first day of high school, where Oreki first explains his philosophy. Obviously the repeated symbolism of the cherry blossoms highlights the enormous difference in Oreki's personality, his desires, his beliefs. KyoAni also chose to have this scene take place in the evening, just before sundown. At first I thought this was an odd decision; surely a sunrise would be more symbolic of Oreki's renaissance? But I think a sunset fits the situation more closely: the gray-colored period of Oreki's life is indeed over, but (unlike Chitanda) he isn't sure yet what his future will be, and so I think it would be misleading to suggest that the next period of his life has already begun. More importantly, the future doesn't actually seem all that promising, despite it being rose-colored, which I'll explain in detail in my next point.   >Secondly, I found Chitanda's monologue fascinating. She admits that she doesn't think the land she's tied to and the life she has to accept are either beautiful or full of potential. She says the people are old and tired and that's left are water and soil. Given the population crisis Japan is facing, this is a very real and very heartbreaking reality, and the melancholy expressed in Chitanda's humble acceptance of a life she doesn't really want is a microcosm of the entire nation of Japan. Science and business are the only options, and neither of them offers any real promise, as captured by Chitanda's lack of enthusiasm. It's somber and it's inevitable, and yet Chitanda says she wanted Oreki to see it because it's all she has. Oreki comments, "A powerful old family," but Chitanda replies, "I wonder about that." She realizes that, while she is bound to Japanese tradition and doesn't seem to have any intention of resisting it, the old way of doing things and the long-standing traditionalism is powerless, because of its inflexibility, to address a radically changing world. Even the long-resolved conflict between the north village and the south village still creates problems even though the reasons for the tension are long dead. Because of this rather hopeless and bleak situation, the sunset that Oreki and Chitanda are walking into definitely seems much more fitting than a sunrise, and much more poignant.   >Finally, I noticed that Oreki, for the first time that I'm aware of, is pushing a bicycle while Chitanda is not. This is a complete reversal from the first episode and from the rest of the series; until now, it was always Chitanda pushing a bicycle while Oreki walked alongside her. I think this demonstrates clearly both of my previous points: Oreki is now the one who is mobile, youthful, free, full of all the possibilities a bicycle represents. Chitanda, on the other hand, is more resigned and knows she cannot get away from Kamiyama City and from the vicelike grip of the aristocratic tradition she was born into.   >In summary, then, this is not a show about mysteries. It is not a show about highschool hijinx or about a group of wacky characters.  Hyouka  is a lamentation about Japan's downward spiral as a nation, a resigned acceptance of the inevitable fact that everything has a beginning and an end, and the show offers no suggestion for finding salvation, no exhortations to rage against the dying of the light. Despite that, the final line of the series inserts an odd bit of optimism, some expression of hope that, despite how grim everything seems, somehow something will emerge from the frozen ground and quietly begin to flourish again. Even in the longest winter, "little birds can remember" the promise of a returning spring. Even facing the inevitable, there remains hope for a better future.   >Summary:
I think it's a little bit of the end-of-series life, and more precisely of the final scene of this episode: >First of all, and more obviously, the whole thing is literally pink color; Oreki, for the first time, wants a pink color life instead of the grey existence of the conservation of the energy he has chosen to this point. Cherry flowers, apart from being a traditional symbol of a new start or a rebirth, also listened to at the first scene of the first episode, the first day of the school, where Oreki first explains his philosophy. Obviously the repeated symbolism of cherry flowers he thinks that the cherries life is a little more of Oreki's life, his desires, his beliefs also chose to have this scene in the evening, just before bedtime.
It is not true that this is the truth that Chim's really is a link to the original post to be that they do not accept that Chim's really. She is the original comment made by /u/SQ_Minion, in all the glorious wholeness: >Okay, I'm going to be a little bit of end-of-series literary analysis, especially in relation to the last scene of this episode: >First, and most obvious, the whole thing is literally pink colored; Oreki, for the first time, wants a pink life instead of the gray existence of energy conservation he chose to this point.

Obviously the repeated symbolism of cherry blossoms underlines the enormous difference in Oreki's personality, his wishes, his life performances. KyoAni also chose to take this scene before sunset.
The people of Chimanda and the people of Chimanda, for the first time, want a life of pink instead of the gray existence of the energy conservation that they have chosen up to this point. Cherry flowers, apart from being an independent symbol of Oreki's personality, their desires, their beliefs. The people of the first scene, the first day of high school, where Oreki first explains his philosophy. Obviously, the repeated symbolism of cherry blossoms highlights the huge difference in the land of Oreki, his views, his views, the people of the land of which the people of Oreki already have their point of view.
Summarize: Throwaway account for reasons.   My girlfriend [26F] and I [28M] have been together for nearly 2 years now.  She moved in to my house with me about six months ago.  Things are great 90% of the time and we avoid a lot of the issues that tend to plague long term couples.  We spend the majority of our free time together and really enjoy each other's company.  But that 10% can completely derail things and it's becoming routine.   There's one huge issue that keeps popping up on a nearly monthly basis: she'll find something about my behavior that she doesn't like then focus on it like a laser beam and use it as an excuse to have a huge argument, which results in multi-day animosity between the two of us.  It's totally out of the blue every time.  I never even remotely see it coming.  When we first started dating she had legitimate points.  I'm a young guy and haven't ever been much of a relationship person so I basically just did whatever I felt like doing at the time (just FYI, this did NOT involve flirting with other women or side flings).  I vehemently stuck to the "be my own man" mentality for quite a while.  This faded as our relationship went on and we became what felt like true partners instead of just two people dating.   The monthly freakouts, however, did not let up.  They became less about actual issues in our relationship and more about totally arbitrary things that haven't even occurred.  She just suddenly picks out something that I did or said and uses it as a launching point to talk about how terrible our relationship is and what an obnoxious, embarrassing person I am.  It's my fault every single time, even if nothing actually occurred.  It's as if her criteria for me being a 'good boyfriend' suddenly changes in her mind for a few days.   She's admitted to over-thinking things on more than one occasion but it's really getting to be a problem.  A few examples: One time we watched a movie and she REALLY stretched to find parallels between the movie's toxic relationship and ours, which turned into her breaking down about the myriad of ways that our relationship could go badly in the future.  Whenever I have a rough day at work and need to vent a little, she assumes that I'm exaggerating and my work problems are totally my fault.  I have a family history of depression and handle it with medication, but when a bad episode kicked in and I became withdrawn she just told me I need to get better control of my emotions.  I had a few beers with her parents (they offered) when we visited over Christmas and she completely flipped out when we got home because she thought I was trying to mentally escape with alcohol and how disgusted she was with my behavior.  We nearly broke up over it.  I wasn't drunk at any point and genuinely had no idea what she was talking about.   She's been stressed out at work recently.  When she got home, we cooked dinner together, took our dogs for a walk, then traded massages.  By most accounts a solid evening.  Then she told me this: "I make it too easy for you.  I always have since we started dating.  You should really have to work harder for it."  'It' referring to sex.  It absolutely infuriated me that she suddenly decided that sex is some sort of currency I need to earn instead of two people who love each other enjoying their bodies and strengthening their bond.  Naturally, we did not have sex.  The thing that made this statement so unexpected to me is that she has a higher sex drive than I do so it's not like I'm constantly 'hounding her for poontang.'   I truly do love her and fully intended on proposing later this year.  We spend quite a bit of time talking about our future plans, kids, etc. and are on the same page for just about everything.  We're very open with each other.  I'm an admittedly sensitive person and some of the stuff she says bothers me more than it should.  There's two sides to every story and I feel like I'm making her sound like a lunatic, and these random freakouts are only a tiny part of our time together.  But they are genuinely so soul-crushingly frustrating that I'm questioning even continuing things with her.  I no longer feel like I can enjoy the good times we have together because in the back of my mind I just KNOW she's going to flip out on me with no warning in the next month and there's nothing I can do about it.   The arguments always end in the same way: I console her, tell her I'm trying my best, assure her that all relationships have rough spots, we say we love each other and want to stay together, then things gradually go back to normal over the next couple days.  Frankly I'm getting sick of feeling like I'm the only person that needs to change to keep the relationship together.  The next time it happens and she says she has doubts about our relationship over some arbitrary problem that hasn't even occurred, I might end up agreeing with her.  I thought they were growing pains from a maturing relationship but I don't see them stopping any time in the future.   Does anyone else have experience in a relationship like this?  I have genuinely never seen her treat anyone else like she treats me in the outbursts.  No matter who she has issues with, she tries to look at it objectively and always shoulders some of the blame.  Other people don't see it when she gets super mad at me - they only see her how she is 90% of the time.  I alone get her bad 10% - because of this I have no frame of reference so I can't really say how much I'm actually at fault.  I really do want things between us to work out, but I can't handle this forever.  If it doesn't lighten up in the future then I don't see her as someone I can spend the rest of my life with.  I need a partner, not someone that will use any excuse to treat me like a verbal punching bag every time they get stressed out.  A relationship isn't exactly healthy when one person is constantly blaming the other for everything.   And before the obligatory "SHE'S ON HER PERIOD" response, the explosive arguments do not sync up with that.Summary:
I need a time for me, our time and a time for me. We spend most of our free time together and really enjoy the company of the other. But that 10% can completely derail things and it becomes routine. There is a huge problem that continues to appear on an almost monthly basis: she will find something about my behavior that she does not like then to focus on it as a laser ray and use it as an excuse to have a huge argument, which results in multi-day animosity between the two of us. It is totally out of the blue every time. I don't even see what man has had time to waste.

I need a little time for myself. I need a little time for myself, a little time for me, a little time for me and a little time for me. I need a little time for myself, a little time for me, a little time for me, and a little time for me. We spend most of our free time together and we really love the company of the other. But 10% can totally derail things and it becomes routine. There is a huge problem that continues to appear on an almost monthly basis: she will find something about my behavior that she doesn't like then focusing on it as a laser beam and using it as an excuse for having a huge argument, which translates into a multi-day animosity between the two of us.

I don't agree with you.     But most commonly, I believe the reason for mass down voting is (only within certain perimeters)     "Ugh, seen it." IF IT IS NOT ON REDDIT CURRENTLY, IT IS NOT A 'REPOST.' Even if it is, what's so bad with reposting something 6 months to a year, not something you personally posted, just because it is GOOD, buried, and desirable to new Reddit users? Please take this with a grain of salt, the tolerably of reposts really has to do with the nature of the content.Summary:

I'm fine when I play vs a computer or AI but once I play vs a real person (even if it's only a custom game) I get easily frustrated, especially when I play badly (which is pretty much always). My mind kind of freezes towards the late game (ex: when i'm zerg I don't get greater spire even though I have hive).   It gets so bad at times when I try to continuously play that my adrenaline starts rushing and my hands start to shake causing me to misclick.

Summarize: So lately I've been pretty fed up about having never been in a proper relationship. So with so little success thus far, I've been trying various apps to meet people.   One of the apps in particular I've tried is grindr (being bisexual), and I've started probably in the region of about 400 conversations with people on there. Of which about 20 actually responded. Goes okay for a little while... then when I ask if they want to meet, I get blocked or just a wall of silence. Sometimes I don't even need to ask that, and things will go silent/blocked anyway. Same thing has happened on other apps as well.   So what is that I'm doing wrong? Am I coming off as creepy? Desperate? Simply unattractive to anyone?Summary:
Summarize: Thanks for the response, Lewis. I still believe that your content is some of the best on Youtube, and in regards to Civ, no one has even the  potential  to create the kind of stuff you make because of the sheer number of content creators you have to work with.   I think your tournament ideas are really interesting, and certainly a way to utilize the massive number of people you could potentially work with. As you may have guessed I'm a  bit  of a Civ purist, so I would be opposed to the idea of allocating points for 2nd and 3rd and so on.  Rythian pointed out in Game 4 what all the commenters have been pointing out- the points don't matter. Many people disable Time Victory, and other than that the scoreboard simply doesn't matter at all. I believe Military isn't even factored in. You can mouse-over the scores to see where points are coming from, the most important of which is probably points from technology. If you guys  only  paid attention to that number, I think your commentary would be much more relevant and enjoyable.   But you see why I'm opposed to this whole point-based ladder- there would be nothing to go off of other than score or makeshift alliances for determining anything other than 1st place. I honestly have no idea how to  begin  allocating points in a system like that.   As for ending games, honestly I'm probably grossly underestimating the way that episode length scales upward during massive endgame wars. It's my understanding that a huge deal of the Yogscast's workload already comes from editing, so asking you to "edit the war down" is probably out of the question. It's just that  so much  of your fans' interest seemingly comes from making predictions, and with no guarantee of an ending, that interest is eventually going to decay.   Because I have your ear, I might also recommend the new "Conquest of the New World Deluxe" scenario for multiplayer. Being a purist it's the kind of thing I'm usually opposed to, but it actually seems pretty good, and definitely pretty short.Summary:

Summarize: There's a huge difference between the gifted programs on the 80's and 90's and the gifted programs today.  There's a lot of really great programs today - as long as you research them as a parent and become informed and involved in your kid's education, you're likely to find some good ones that will really challenge and motivate your kids.   My school recommended me for the gifted program pretty quick, but my mother was against it.  She looked into what the program was at my elementary school ('94) and said, "NOPE!"  It was indeed a joke, and did nothing but give that group of kids an over-inflated sense of self worth.   She sort of half-home-schooled me instead.  She negotiated with my teachers to let her do my math lessons - so I was always a good 2 years ahead in math.  I started a few high school classes in middle school, and some college classes in high school.   At 16 I started to hate high school and begged to be aloud to drop out and just take the GED.  She wouldn't let me.  So I skipped a year instead - did my Jr. and Sr. years in 1 year instead of 2 to go to college at 17.  I also refused to do anything higher than Calculus, so my math stopped progressing in 9th grade.   However it was the same as a lot of people on here are saying - I was positive that whatever I did utilizing my minimal effort was always going to be good enough if not great.  College came around and wrecked me - having to do homework outside of class wrecked me - and having to actually read the textbook and study wrecked me.  I ended up graduating engineering school with a 2.5 GPA.Summary:

I remember being like 14 and channel surfing past Smackdown in time to see him in some random throwaway squash where he no-sold all of Chavo Guerrero's shit and World's Strongestly Slammed him to death. It might have been part of the Chavo/Hornswoggle feud. I didn't know anything about wrestling at this point, I just remember thinking, "wow, that dude with the dreads is badass."

Summarize: Hello /r/relationships,   I've had a relationship with my girlfriend for the past 2 1/2 years, and live with her in the same suite.   Up until recently everything went great, until about New Year's Day 2014. Ever since then, I've had constant thoughts about breaking things off with her despite things not seeming wrong at all. We almost never fight, any issues are worked out almost instantly, neither of us hold grudges, and everyone seems to think we are perfect for each other.   The thing is, I do not think I am in love with her anymore. I still love her, just not romantically. We rarely get intimate anymore and when we do, it's always me to initiates it. I really see her as more of a friend to hang out with rather than a romantic partner.   So, now I'm in a dilemma. Because you see, we live together and our nearest homes, should we break up, is about 3 hours away for me, and a whole continent away for her.   And there's also the fact that my parents absolutely love her, and they've even hinted at me multiple times that I should marry her, and that I should never let her go. Her parents also approve of me.   But since I have these thoughts about breaking up so often and almost all the time I just don't know what to do. I do not think I can marry her like this, unless these thoughts just go away at some point (which I doubt)   I'm also worried for the inevitable that should we break up, our friendship would crumble too.   I know this kind of sounds rushed, it's just that I do not know how to express my feeling properly at the moment. I can provide more details if you need more.   The way I see it there's three options: 1) Stay with her, hope these thoughts go away eventually. 2) Break up with her and move out. This is tricky considering the placement of our other homes. 3) Break up with her, but stay living in the same suite (we have an additional bed/bedroom).   Would anyone have any advice for me? I am really stuck in a bind and I have no idea how I can fix this.Summary:

Summarize: This is a bit over due, but things have been crazy!   I had my 35 week check up on November 14th. Everything was great. Had my GBS swabs done & heard bub's heartbeat. My attending physician asked if I wanted a cervical check done by a student. "Sure, why not?" It would be my second one this pregnancy & how else will a student learn without practicing. (First one was done after going into the ER for spotting, turns out my cervix was being irritated from sexual intercourse.) I was told I was 1 cm dialated & my cervix was still hard. Good, little guy had 4 weeks to go still. I wasn't due until December 18th.   That Saturday, my boyfriend & I went out to dinner to celebrate our 3 year anniversary together. We did some baby shopping for clothes but planned to do the rest later. We were making bets on when bub decided he'd come. I said 2 weeks from then & he said 3. Boy, were we in for a huge surprise! On Monday, November 18th around 7:00 pm, I noticed bub wasn't moving as much as normal. I was a little worried but decided to eat something sugary & wait 30 minutes. If he still didn't move, we'd head straight to the hospital. He started moving, but still not as much as I was used to. I figured he might be getting cramped in there so I'd wait until morning to see if I still felt uneasy. If I did, I'd call my doctor to see what they would recommend I do.   The next morning, November 19th, my 3 year old & I woke up around 8:00 like we always do. Got ourselves dressed & bundled up to take my boyfriend's younger sister to the bus stop like we do every morning. 8:28, time to head down the street to get to the bus! We walked like we usually do if it isn't too cold. By the time we got there, I started to feel a little crampy. I wrote it off as not having breakfast yet. Get back home around 8:40, pop in some Toaster Struddles for us & start eating. By 8:50, I feel like I if I poop, I'll feel better. While I'm in there, I lose my mucus plug! I go to lay down & drink water because I'm still feeling crampy.   9:00, I call my OB. I told them I just lost my mucus plug & I think I may be having contractions. I know it can be weeks before anything happens after losing your mucus plug. I'm told to wait an hour & see if I have 8 contractions, or what I think are contractions. (I was induced with my first. I went from having no contractions to heavy ones, then an epi. Never had little ones.) I was to call back in an hour with my results & be told what to do from there. They honestly felt like menstrual cramps. I call my boyfriend to let him know what's going on & then my mother. At this point they're becoming a little more painful & closer together. My mom told me to go to the hospital NOW because  I was in labor. Nope, complete denial on my end.   9:20, I now have had 8. I call my OB back to let them know & I was told to head in to be hooked up to a monitor & have a cervical check. I'll never have that cervical check! I call my boyfriend to let him know I was told to come in. He thinks I'm being over-dramatic, but will take me in. 9:30, he still isn't home & these things are killing me! I'm yelling & carrying on. My poor 3 year old is freaked out. He runs to get my boyfriend's sister. She comes downstairs & I tell her, I think I'm in labor. She starts packing my hospital bag as I lay on the bed waiting for my boyfriend to get home so we can head to the hospital.   9:40 he's home & I'm in total bitch mode. I'm hurting & yelling at him to hurry up. When I wasn't having a contraction, I was apologizing to them both for yelling & being rude, but I was hurting so bad I couldn't control it.9:45, we get in the car. We were going to take my car (leather seats,) but couldn't find my keys in all of the chaos. We take his instead (cloth seats, oops!) He loads up the hospital bag & my boppy pillow & we're off!   The next part is very jumbled & I don't remember the times of these events. We get on the highway, the hospital is about 15 minutes away. I'm still contracting & they're becoming more intense. I can feel his head going lower & lower with each contraction but I'm telling myself, "Hold out, we're almost there, don't have this baby in the car!" When we're about 6 minutes from the hospital, I feel him crowning. I tell my boyfriend I feel his head & this is about to happen. I unbuckle myself & rip my pants down. Blood is everywhere in my pants & it's just dripping on to the seat. Next contraction, I start pushing. My water breaks & out pops his head! I push hard one last time & he comes out completely. I grab him & turn him over so I can see his face. I sit back down, grab my jacket, wrap him up, then start beating his back to get him to breathe. He cries a little & starts turning pink. At this point, I'm completely calm. I feel nothing but joy!   While all of this is going on, my boyfriend is still driving! We're 3 minutes from the hospital. He calls 911 to let them know what has happened & we were told docotors & nurses would be waiting for us at the ER entrance. Well, L&D is closer so we go there. He parks in the valet drop off & runs inside. He tells the security officer what has happened. They both take off to the welome desk. Within 2 minutes, our car is surrounded by OB's & nurses. They're talking to me, asking how I feel. I felt great, grinning from ear to ear. My little boy is right here, in my lap. They clamp his cord & daddy gets to cut it from the driver's seat! Woosh, my little boy is off to be checked out. They help me stand up out of the car. I tell them I have pooped myself & it's everywhere. They tell me they'll clean me up once we're inside. Up I stand, blanket goes around me, & my placenta falls out. The nurse caught it like it was niothing!   I am out on a gurney & wheeled upstairs. My boyfriend is following behind with my bag. Just in complete shock. We get upstairs, baby is being cleaned up & examined. Everything is just perfect with him! He's an amazing little guy. Liam Conor; 6 lbs, 14 oz, 19 inches & 4 weeks, 1 day early! We also guessed he was born around 10:10, not completely sure though. I had a first degree tear that I got stitches for. I also got a shot (don't remember the name) to help with clotting. My boyfriend then gets to hold bub while I'm being stitched up & I get to look at him & touch him. Once I'm stitched up, it's time to eat. He nurses for an hour straight! We finally get a chance to call family to let him know he had been born.   Everything was perfect. I had my labor like I wanted. Natural & just my boyfriend & I present. Best birth I could ever ask for.Summary:

I have only been in Boston for a total of maybe 7 hrs while I was waiting for a flight, so I have no idea about location of boroughs, the school, or anything really.   Okay, what we are looking for is a 2BR, dog friendly apartment for maybe 800-850, but no more than that. It doesn't need to be in town, but I'd like for it to be somewhere that I don't have to use my car to get to class if at all possible.

Summarize: Just wanted to share some info with you guys.   My hand is (all Epic Perfect Pros) Cena, Taker, Jericho, Rowan, AJ Lee.   After seeing on here that people thought +5 was the place to be, I charted 60 games, 30 +3, and 30 +5.  Quick note: I used to only do +5 if the +5 opponent had fewer wins and more losses than the +3 opponent - I figured that that was the easiest way to determine that they had a significantly worse winning percentage.   So the info:     I won all 30 +3 matches   I won 26 of the 30 +5 matches for a .8667 win percentage and an average points per game of 4.33   In games where the +5 opponent had a significantly worse win percentage, I was only 7 of 9 for a .778 win pct and 3.89 points per game     In my case, it would always be better to play the +5 game   Also, backing into what my score would be:   Before I started this study, I had 952 points.  Considering I played the great majority of games at +3, that comes out to about 317 games, if I had won those games at a rate of 4.33 points per game, I would have 1633 points (assuming I played those last 60 games in the study as well).   This probably wouldn't be enough to get me to the next reward class, which I don't want to get to anyway.  So the study and posting this doesn't prove much to me, but it is a fun diversion from the fun diversion that is WWE SuperCardSummary:

Summarize: Dude, I have to chime in here and say I was faced with the same situation... 15 years ago.  Ever since, I've been "cleaning up the pieces" from the wreck that ensued by not going with my strength in music.  ...Still suffering as a result of having been afraid of the consequences of not choosing to be a "good boy" and do what my family wanted me to do.  I listened to them decide for me, cuz I was scared and not strong.   Granted, THEIR intentions are good - but that's all it is... THEIR's (colored by their experiences and dreams for you), not necessarily yours (remember, you are an individual with your own purpose to fulfill).  And, of course, "good intentions pave the path to hell."   As parents, they're trying to protect you - they don't see you yet as a young man.  Protecting you will backfire.  Ultimately, you're at a turning-point in your life, where you have to now step up as a young man and assert your authentic self/who you are.  Related:  "a ship is safe in harbor, but is that what a ship is made for?" - anonymous   The music will never die in you, my friend - and everything else will never be as rewarding, no matter how much you're making.  Everything else will just be "killing time" - fucking mundane, and everyone "normal" in your non-music world will be just as lame, living it up for Costco, coffee, and cubicles.   It's a bleak picture, but once you go down that path...  you're talking at least 4 years of your life, tens of g's gone, and working your ass off shuffling paper with people who have zero connection to making music.  If it sounds soul-crushing - it is.   If you hear the music biz can be detrimental to your health, consider the alternative of sitting on your ass 5 days/wk, eating out mostly, coffee for breakfast, then ending your day sitting on your ass trying to escape in front of a tv or at a bar - or hell, maybe both!   On a brighter note, I've realized the reality being that if you're passionate and strong about something, go do it/tap into that energy and the money and fulfillment will come - it'll be a natural (not forced) extension of who you are, GENUINEly.  So you'll find a way to make money doing it.  It's a no-brainer.  Also, "who you know" is king, and it already sounds like you're connected (= future, potential business connections... customers, partners, whatever).  It would be a waste to let all of that work you've done go and not honored it.   Go with your soul and you'll have wellbeing.  Go against it, it'll be a constant fight/struggle/dissonance - nothing will ever feel like it "fits" or that you "fit."  The longer this goes on, the more damage it causes psychologically, relationship-wise, and, ultimately, physically.  Be well, dude, choose wisely :)Summary:

Summarize: Dual core locked at 3.5 ghz. Always pretty much maxed out during most intensive games. Can't OC as I have an H97/i3. I have a factory overclocked version of the 750ti so it gives me a nice little boost! I just took a look at benchmarks for the Iris Pro and you're not going to live this: It gets 25 fps in Bioshock infinite in very high settings at  1600x900 . I get a solid 60 fps maxed out on a $140 card at 1080p. We're comparing apples to bonobos here though. Desktop cards will destroy any(well,  not  any ) laptop equivalents, especially if they are integrated gpus.Summary:
Summarize: I've used android for several years and I just switched to an iphone 6. I don't feel too big of a difference in every day usage except for the app store. On google play, when I search for something it usually gives me a "good" list of relevant apps.   In the appstore, when I search for something like "data tracker" for keeping track of my data usage, it gives me a few relevant apps but then it starts showing random stuff, like baby tracker, coffee tracker. I can't entirely blame them, it's just looking at key words.   But when I select an app and click related, most of the time it gives me more unrelated apps. It shows apps by the same author, which is fine, but then it shows apps that are in the same "category" and usually these are so broad. One of the data tracking apps was listed under finance and it just gave me a bunch of finance apps, completely irrelevant. Also, the "customers also bought" list is totally useless as it barely gives me anything related.   Compared to google play, the related apps actually give me a good list of apps that are relevant, not just from same author or category. It gives a list of say, data tracking apps, after i click related and it's not just that the name is similar.   Also, the ratings is so different compared to google play. I understand it shows recent reviews by default, but does it also depend on country? The number of ratings and reviews overall are so low compared to how popular the apps are. Or maybe it's just google play?   Do you guys think it's the same or am I doing something wrong? How do people find really good apps?Summary:
Summarize: I would like some legal advice on what to do/tell the university judicial board in my situation. Two weeks ago my buddy's dorm room was searched after he and a number of other people (stupidly) smoked out the dorm and the RA's smelled the dank stank from all the way down the hall and called the cops. There was a large amount of alcohol in the room and some other sketchy things i wont go into. I was not present when the raid occurred but my backpack taken up in the search and there was a small amount of marijuana in it. Also on my backpack was a tag with my name, address, phone number, everything, and my car/room/house keys were in the side pocket. my friend claimed responsibility for everything in the room, including the bud in my backpack, so i thought i was ok despite losing my backpack and keys. However yesterday i received and email from the judicial board and now i have an appointment to discuss the charges tomorrow. Since it was not actually found on me, do i have a good chance of getting off scott free if i claim i forgot the backpack in the room earlier in the day before the drinking/smoking started and that someone must have slipped the bud in the backpack when the cops showed up? I should also mention that while i am a student at the university, i am also a minor with no prior offenses.Summary:

Summarize: I can't really comment on your style and which toe is better, but hopefully I can explain their weird sizing.   On the US Standard (same as Allen Edmonds) size chart, I'm a 9.5E.

Summarize: The combat is hands down the best in any mmorpg coming from a souls player with 1000+ hours across DaS one and two. I wouldn't say that it's weighty, but it's very active and the cross-profession mechanics make group play a lot more fun and engaging than solo play, which is saying something since solo combat is still a blast. However, there's a lot of sitting around and swatting in the higher tiers of "difficulty" with a couple exceptions. Most people do the higher level combat for the rewards and not for the stuff itself. I guess what I'm getting at is that the combat isn't as fluid and weighted Souls, but it's got a similar vibe. It's still engaging and you need to look at what your character is doing and not just at your HUD. You're not reading the enemies tells to know which direction to dodge, or whether or not to attack, but you do need to monitor your own movements and health, etc to make sure that you don't die yourself. There are a couple exceptions: Giganticus Lupicus and a few other bosses in particular would feel right at home in a Souls game.     Tons of people play. Tons. It'd be very, very hard to ever feel alone.     GW2 is a casual game in that you don't need to play every day to keep up (or even close. You could stop playing for six months and jump right back in). Once you hit 80 and get geared you're more or less on equal footing with the majority of the playerbase. It's a lot less about grinding for higher stats than it is grinding for prettier armor, or self-imposed challenges like soloing dungeons, etc. Mostly prettier armor.  As for "getting into" it, if you enjoy hundreds of hours of playing video games then you'll get into it. If you don't then you'll play the game and be done when you're done. It's a really interesting world from a lore standpoint, if that's what you're worried about. However since there's no real incentive to play at any given point other than actually wanting to play, instead of grind or whatever (since you can always do it later), you probably won't find yourself coming back to it as often you would another mmo--there's not really a sense of responsibility unless you choose to impose one on yourself.       Honestly, you'd be a fool not to get the game. It's a game with thousands of hours of content for $60. At the very least it's leagues better than buying a game for $60 that you put down three days after you've bought it and never pick it back up again.Summary:
It's a game that you're really doing 'to do the best in every mmorpg that is played by a soul player with more than 1000 hours over DaS one and two. I wouldn't say that it's important, but it's very active and the cross-professional mechanics make group play much more fun and engagement than solo game, which says something because solo fighting is still an explosion. However, there's a lot of sitting and swatting in the higher levels of "difficulty" with a few exceptions. Most people do the higher level fighting for the rewards and not just for the stuff itself. I think what I'm not going to read to know which direction to dodge, or less attack, but it has a similar mood. It's still very appealing and you have to do what your character, and not just play at your HUD. Tonus cholos cholos.

Summarize: Infection is, by and large, such a ridiculously unbalanced gametype that it blows my mind that it is one of the most popular playlists in Reach. Every game goes the same way - humans find a place to camp where it is extremely difficult for the zombies to get to them and grind out kills. Absolutely no fun for the zombies. However, maps and gametypes designed for balanced Infection in Forge are easily some of the best casual experiences in Halo.   The way I see it, vanilla Reach Infection is an abomination. AA completely ruin it. The pistol is too powerful. Maps are horrible for Infection (don't even get me started on Sword Base). If you're a zombie, you'd do better to just give up. The Forge community has by and large not helped the map situation since most of them are 'Zombie City' maps, which are frankly terrible. Halo 3 default infection had similar issues, but to a far smaller extent. No AA. Pistol was powerful, but the lack of a scope and slower fire rate made it more balanced. Maps were also much better. Still, zombies were by and large underpowered. The Forge community didn't help the map situation, considering most Infection maps in Halo 3 were also 'Zombie City' maps made on Foundry by throwing together some walls, fences, boxes and windows and calling it a city.   The best Infection maps are dedicated maps and gametypes designed in favour of the zombies. Zombies which are given routes around the maps which gives them an edge over the humans. However, humans are also given access to weapons, if they can reach them. Great maps could create paranoia among the humans and forced them to work in a team.Summary:
Summarize: The infection is, overall, a game so ridiculously unbalanced that it blows my mind that it is one of the most popular playlists in Reach. Each game goes in the same way - humans find a place to camp where it is extremely difficult for zombies to go to them and crush the killings. Absolutely no fun for zombies. However, cards and game types designed for balanced infection in Forge are easily some of the best occasional experiences in Halo. The way I see it, the vanilla Reach Infection is an abomination. AA completely ruin it. The gun is too powerful. The cards are horrible for the infection (do not even make me start on Sword Base). If you are a zombie, you better drop it.

Summarize: Something that's always bothered me about Finding Nemo, is that in the opening scene we see Marlin and (insert lady-fish name here) discuss their excitement about being parents. They have hundreds and hundreds of eggs due to hatch any day now. However, fate intervenes and mommy and all eggs minus one become supper for a hungry barracuda (read: not cool.)   Cut to: Nemo's first day at school! So exciting! Notice that there seem to be only one of each type of fish, but we do see at least one instance of a parent dropping off multiple fish. Given what we know, from the movie and basic marine biology, is that fish hatch many at a time.   This leads me to believe that what happened to Marlin and Nemo at the beginning of the movie isn't rare, not even frequent, it's actually the norm. You have a bunch of kids, but by the time they're of school age, most have been eaten by predators.Summary:
Summarize: They blew most of the budget on the voice acting. It's not that there isn't a ton of content, there is. The biggest problem is that BioWare seems to either have no budget for QA, the engine really is unworkable, or their programmers are just weak.   Take a look at the latest expansion, Shadow of Revan. On paper it looks great. Two new planets, a new story arc, new dungeons, new operations (raids), etc. Then you play it and you get:     Two small planets with barely enough content to fill the increase in level cap (5 levels).      -Three of the "New Hard Mode" dungeons are just scaled up older dungeons from the lead up to the expansion.     The story arc, including the final boss, can be completed solo (if desired) within a week of launch. This isn't like other MMO's where they launch an expansion and then patch in new updates to that expansion for a year or two. The expansion storyline is pretty much over and they're moving to a new arc later this year.     The game engine is more buggy/unstable than ever. I played the "early (one week)" release of SoR and quests were unable to be completed, items were inactive, and the final boss in solo-mode was almost unbeatable due to bugs. In fact the only way to finish the story was to wait for another bug to negate the original bugs.       Then there's the UI. I've played many MMO's over the last decade and I've never seen a situation (aside from maybe Wildstar) in which the default user interface actually hampered performance. If you ever play SWTOR try hiding the interface sometime and watch your FPS jump (double in some cases). Then BioWare adds new interface features (such as highlighted quick bar buttons) which add more bloat. BioWare's official response to this was "Well, of course the interface is going to hurt performance because it does stuff."Summary:
Summarize: Hi /r/cars!  Just to preface, I wanted to thank you guys for some great input on previous threads - I got some good info from just browsing over past threads (upvotes were, of course, doled out appropriately ^^).   That said, I got a more specific question for you guys.  I was originally hoping to buy a car in the $7-9k price range, even though I can afford more - I'm just not a big car guy, so I just want something that'll get me from Point A to Point B and, above all, won't break down on me or require a ton of work/maintenance/money/upkeep.  Something I can just buy and NOT WORRY ABOUT.   The sales dude (with Enterprise; they insist they're NOT commissioned based on $ of car sold, just on whether they sell it - less incentive to needlessly upsell) spent some pretty serious effort on driving home the point that I should buy a newer car.  He said that the lower mileage I'm buying with that jump from 9k to 12k will translate to a car that'll last a significant number of years longer before having major issues.  He suggested further that 100k is basically the point at which just about all cars start becoming at risk for Shit Going Wrong, regardless of how solid they are.   So, my question is... does he have a point?  Would I get more value for my money, over the years, from buying a much newer car for more money now as opposed to an older reliable-model (e.g. civic) car with ~100k miles for less money?  Also, it's probably relevant to mention that I'm in the DC area; I'm hesitant to trust anyone I deal with, even private listings.  Haven't even found a good mechanic yet, so while I'm definitely getting a PPI, I'm not so sure it'll be 100% reliable.  So it may be a good idea for me to play this extra-conservatively.   Thanks guys! /RenSummary:

Summarize: I'm a male, raised from dope house to dope house by an addict mother and a series of violent addict step-fathers.  That wasn't traumatic enough I guess, so being a combat medic (I was told I would be a non-combatant, wouldn't have to carry a gun: perhaps there is some moral injury to my trauma as well) in the US Army sounded like a good idea (enlisted pre-Iraq war).  Then Operation Iraqi Freedom kicked off and they sent me there.  That wasn't traumatic enough (and all of my leadership told me the army was the only place for me and that I would fail in civilian life), so I re-enlisted to go back to Iraq a couple more times.  That was finally traumatic enough for the Army at least, so they kicked me out on a pension and I went to college to study photojournalism.  I studied photojournalism so that I could take pictures of just how traumatic war is, because I thought that it was important that everyone know just how traumatic war is.  Thinking that I couldn't become more traumatized, I returned to Iraq, bouncing between there and Syria as a journalist and humanitarian aid worker.  I was finally traumatized enough and decided to take a vacation in lovely Germany...  However a working vacation, documenting traumatized refugees of the ongoing civil wars in Iraq and Syria.   In Germany I met the woman of my dreams, literally.  I'd had an image of what that girl was since I was 12 years old: dark skin, dark hair, and bright, sparkling personality.  We fell in love quickly, and I gave up my obsession with constantly re-traumatizing myself, giving up my idea of being a war photographer.  I decided to take a sabbatical and re-determine a course of life that could work with hers.  During this sabbatical I began taking lots of psychedelic drugs along with her.  I felt it was a cool new way of us bonding at first, but it just eventually became my escape from trauma.  I would take drugs at every possible interval and would become emotionally volatile, especially to her.  We live in a 36 square meter, one room flat on a loud party street.  Tensions rose, especially when we couldn't afford drugs and partying.  When we could, everything was great.  Eventually we decided to marry, and did though we had only known one another and been together for a year and change.   Fast forward a few months and a few massive panic attacks later, she convinced me to get off of drugs and seek therapy.  I did and just recently received this diagnosis of Post Traumatic Personality Disorder, which from what I have read is supposed to be somewhere between Complex Traumatic Stress Disorder and Borderline Personality Disorder, coming from a lifetime of unchecked trauma.   This diagnosis scares the shit out of me, and I'm hoping that I can overcome the supposed BPD portion of it.  Every article I've read on BPD in males is so absolutely damning.  I'm not looking for a mother.  Though I've had a significant number of partners, romances and micro-romances, it is likely because I have been super busy in my life with little time for long-lasting relationships, I am happy with just this one amazing woman who is now my wife.  I am guilty of thrill-seeking behavior and drug-abuse.  I am impulsive.  I am in so many ways way more "all or nothing" than what is within normal boundaries.  My wife is driven mad and calls me a drama queen, to which I often sling back insults.  I have cheated, as has she in a period where we had a very complicated open relationship.   I have a plan for the road ahead at least: stay clear-headed, remain as stress-free yet engaged as possible, psychotherapy, couples therapy, medication as a stop measure for panic attacks and flashbacks, volunteer work until and perhaps even after I get my work permit for here in Germany, actual work, saving for a larger flat with more at least three rooms, structure, schedule, exercise, diet.  I've considered also keeping a mood diary, and a log of things that I do that mimic Borderline symptoms.  Does anyone have any idea as to what else I could do to iron out my fucked up life, and save my beautiful, fairytale relationship?Summary:

That was not traumatic enough, I think, so I was a combat physician (I was told I would be a non-combatant, would not have to carry a weapon: maybe there is a moral violation of my trauma as well) in the U.S. army sounded like a good idea (listed before-Iraq war). Then Operation Iraqi freedom resigned and they sent me there. That was not traumatic enough so that they put me on a boarding house and I went to college to study photojournalism. I studied photojournalism woman, so I was back pictures of how traumatic war is because I thought it was at least traumatic enough for the army that all working traumatic war felt fast.

I studied photojournalism woman so I could return to Iraq a few times. That was finally traumatic enough for the army at least so that she worked me on a traumatic line since I had no trauma dream in Syria any more.
Summarize: For the last couple weeks I have been working out extra hard for the summer and getting great results and setting new PRs. My new trick is to reserve a song that gets me jacked strictly for PR attempts. Lifting heavy weights is very much a mental game and many times it is little things that give you the edge you need. The song I use is "Real American" by Rick Derringer, (aka Hulk Hogan's entrance theme.) When I put this song on, it gets me psyched to attack the weights like they are the Iron Sheik and lift them up like they're Andre the Giant. The best part is that I only listen to this song a couple times a week, at the most, so its pumping-up effect does not wear off. This has worked wonders for me and I thought I would pass it along to all of you.Summary:

Summary: In the last couple of weeks I've worked extra hard for the summer and got great results and new PRs. My new trick is to reserve a song that gets me severely cracked for PR attempts. Lifting heavyweights is a lot of mental play and often it's little things that give you the edge you need. The song I use is "Real American" by Rick Derringer, (aka Hulk Hogan's initial theme.) When I put this song on, it gets me psyched to attack the weights as they are the Iron Sheik and lift them up as they are Andre the Giant. The best part is that I hear this song only a few times a week, most so that its pump-up effect doesn't fade. This has miracles for me and I thought I would pass it on to all of you. Summary:

Summarize: Hi Reddit. Thanks for your time. Im sorry im not English so please bear with me.   I am 24(m) and have been going out with my girlfriend (22) for just less than four years. Everything was great until about the time we became sexual during the first few months. We were each others first partners but i was more experienced than her, in terms of knowing what to do. She was clueless. I did not think much about this as i thought she would learn. She did learn, but not as much as you would expect from a girl of her age and intelligence. For example she still uses her nails during a handjob which hurts a lot. She is like a dead animal in bed and not very creative etc   A few nights ago i was fingering her and doing oral which she was loving but when i spread her legs more to do what she loves she said it felt like i was examining her. This was a boner killer for me and i just stopped and slept. I know all about her body, what she likes, what she doesnt and what turns her on, but i am pretty sure she hasnt put in much effort in exploring mine.   Tonight she came over and i made one of our favorite meals. After eating we started watching a movie sitting in bed. She got my dick out and began giving me a hand-job which sucked. It was dry and was beginning to get painful when i hinted for her to stop. I was annoyed at the fact that she does not put effort into doing anything sexual properly even though we have talked about it. She then faced away from me. The movie finished and she decided she wanted to go home. I asked her why she was mad at me at the door she didnt answer. I then sent her a text. The reply i got was painful. She said in her words, "Am fed up of making all the effort." I replied saying, "I do nothing?" and the most painful was when she said "Not to b wiv me." It felt like a knife to the heart.Summary:

We were all other first partners, but I was more experienced than she, in terms of knowing what to do. She was clueless. I didn't think much about how I thought she would learn. She learned but didn't expect as much as she would from a girl of her age and intelligence, but if I did her legs more, what she said she felt like I was judging her. This was a bone killer for me and she only heard and slept. I know all about her body what she likes, what she does, but if I did her legs more to do what she said she felt like I was her exam.
She gave me the answer, but not as much as you expected from a girl of her age and intelligence. For example, she still uses her nails during a hand job that hurts a lot.

She told me that the truth, what she liked, what she did as if she liked it, but what she liked, she told me it was one thing that she liked, but I told me that she was seeing the most beautiful thing.
Summarize: Maybe not the most exciting thing here, but...   One time I was driving through a rural Georgia road, surrounded by woods, and I spilled some coffee on my pants. I was about a half hour away from meeting my (ex) gf and her parents, and I didn't want to have soaking wet pants, so I pulled over to change. I figured there were no cars around for miles, so I went ahead and stripped to my boxers outside my car.   Thats when I was approached by a very large ostrich that emerged from the woods. It came within an arms reach of me, and was making all sorts of ostrichy noises and staring like the raptors in Jurrasic Park. I think this would have only been slightly alarming, but not wearing pants made the situation much more terrifying to me. I quickly got into my car (sans pants) and drove away. No one, and I mean no one, has ever believed that story.Summary:

Summarize: They are one of only a couple companies that sell a narrow/wide chainring that mounts directly onto the SRAM spindle, eliminating the need for the chainring spider.   Basically, since placing the order, I haven't been able to get in touch with them via email. I live in the US, so I have a few questions about my order, and how it got shipped.   First, the email I received from them said that my order had been "DISPATCHED". For those of us not from the UK, does that mean it has been shipped? (that was my first email question to them...on Jan 16th)   My second email was sent a few days later (Jan 20th) asking if there was any information about when I could expect to receive my shipment, or if there was any tracking information for it. Since it's international, I figure there probably isnt any.   I just sent them a third email laying out my frustration with the lack of responses, and how it looks from a customer's point of view.   Am I being overly concerned, or coming across rude? It's just not normal to me to have so little info about an order.Summary:

Summarize: I am assuming there are many ex-religious people here. You have to put yourself in their mindset and use arguments they understand. I was a very devout Christian for many years. I know how I thought back then, and most atheist arguments make too big of a leap intellectually for people to process and just end up coming off as snooty and dismissive.   You have to carefully dissect what they are saying and use their own arguments against them. Many religious people have their beliefs heavily engrained in their culture, so you have to understand where the arguments are coming from and why. If you can get them to start admitting flaws in their culture and religion, and start to look at the hypocrisy of their own opinions then you can start to chip away and show them how they haven't really thought things through. You can have good debates with religious people that have thought things through but post people just have never given any other ideas any thought and come back at you emotionally and feeling attacked.Summary:

Calculus is inextricable from the nature of physics because one of the most basic ideas in physics is that reality is smooth (i.e. differentiable multiple times).Summary:

Summarize: I just found out what would make me move. And I'm going to very soon.   There's been a man missing from a small town near me for a few days now. Also, there's two guys that just moved into a ratty old trailer right up the road from me. On a good day, I could throw a rock from my driveway and hit their house. Anyway, these two guys are serious thieves and drug users that just got out of prison recently.   So the man that's been missing drove a white Ford pickup with tool boxes on it. The guy up the road from me has recently acquired a white Ford pickup with tool boxes on it. And the missing man's credit card. So the cops tracked down him and his roommate, to this place right down the road from me. They arrested the one guy, but can't find his roommate.   Anyway, some of the cops noticed some freshly disturbed dirt in the yard over there. They bring in the cadaver dogs, and guess what they find buried in the yard? Yup, the man that's been missing for the last few days.   So with the cops having  not  found the roommate, I've been on high alert since yesterday morning and have all my hardware loaded and easily accessible. I also have been packing things up and getting ready to move my house. It'll be expensive as hell because, well... It's a house. 59-mile trip, special permits, etc...   Anyway, one too many bodies found too close to me. So I'm outta here. Headed back toward Greenwood.

Summarize: I suppose I will ask here, since I planned on playing on Project1999.   I played EQ for the first time yesterday. Made an Iksar Necromancer since those were good, but I couldn't find my way around the starting town, let alone find the necromancer guild master. I also had to get used to the controls and camera modes but decided to stick with the first person view since the other camera modes seem kinda weird.   Anyway, having found no success with the Iksar town I made a human necromancer in Freeport. Another player  messaged me and gave me some free stuff, but died while trying to handle the inventory (almost all my slots were full of scrolls and letters so I died while trying to rearrange my inventory to make space for the stuff).   After that, I decided to find the necromancer guild master, Opal Blackbriar. Sadly I had no clues whatsoever, so I decided to hit the wiki which said the guild master is in a basement under the Inn. I went there but couldn't find the secret entrance and googling didn't give me any more information. Maybe you can give me a hint? Please?   I'm also fairly intimidated by the scope of the game. I don't know anything really and I'm worried I can't keep up if I haven't played EQ back in the day. Maybe there's a guide for someone completely new to the game? I checked the "Getting started/returning" link on the right but that one mostly describes the classes and I feel the wiki can't help me that much if I'm not sure what I'm looking for. Any help would be really appreciated.Summary:

Summarize: So, we met on reddit about five months ago and instantly hit it off. We had a bunch of similar interests and liked the same shows, books, etc. I knew he was straight from the start though, so I never figured anything more would come from it—and I was fine with that. It did, however, feel like we were from different worlds at first, since I was ostensibly just a femme gay boy and he was a masculine straight guy.   But after a couple months of talking and getting to know each other, he slowly started getting a bit flirty with me—and he eventually confessed that he had "confusing feelings" toward me. How even though I was still a boy, he liked me. And how he didn't care if I stayed a boy or became a girl; he just wanted me. I decidedly liked him too. So we gave it a go.   He is/was so amazing. We got along so well. Never fought. I always loved talking to him and spending time with him. He even told his friends and family that he was talking to a "cute boy becoming a cute girl"—which really amazed me, since that is a big thing to tell people. He's tall and muscular and dominant—and called me cute or adorable at least five times a day. Fun to talk to, and great at communicating. Plus, his accent/voice is just magic.   God. =[   He's been there for me every day, being so supportive during whatever I was going through: getting my first hormones, when stuff happened with my family, if I got scared or stressed out about something.   I had begun to imagine myself moving to Australia to be with him after I finish school. Imagining meeting his amazing family and friends. Imagining all the stuff we would do together in real life. I was even planning on visiting him this summer when I study abroad in China.   But the past few days something felt off: as I got closer to him, I wanted to explore a fetish that is important for me—but it's just a real turn off for him, so it wouldn't have worked for either of us. This led to us talking about some heavy things (future of our relationship). I knew he wanted kids, but I had never told him I didn't. After, he said he can't be in a LTR with someone where kids aren't at least on the eventual horizon. And that was the nail in the coffin.Summary:
I had a lot of similar interests and I liked the same shows, the same books, etc. I knew he was straight from the beginning, so I never thought anything more would come from him – and I agreed with that. But he started to have a little flirtation with me – and he finally confessed that he had "smooth feelings" towards me. Even if I was still a boy, he loved me. And how he didn't like me remaining a boy or becoming a girl; he just wanted me to do something good to him after I loved him.

Although I was still a boy, he liked me: and how he didn't care if I stayed a child or became a girl; he just loved me. I decided that he also liked a little bit. So we gave a walk to a fashion boy.
Summarize: Hi all, looking for some advice on getting a new bike.     I have a Canondale cross bike from 2001 that I ride as a road bike, but its nice to know it can do trails. I really like it. It works well when I go through shit areas. I like taking it to the market and stuff. * I had a road bike for two years that I ended up selling because it didn’t fit or “ride right”  (even though it was supposedly the right size)   Im starting to ride more/have a better job, so I wanted to upgrade my bike, but its not worth dumping money into a bike from 2001 worth maybe 400 bucks.   This led me to start looking for a road bike (and make the Canondale a secondary bike) After all my research and bike porn lust, I settled on a custom steel bike thats probably going to end up running up around 5-6k. uh oh.     Pros: It will be awesome, I rode the last bike I loved (the canondale) for over a decade so I don’t feel like its a total waste, it will fit perfectly, it will be dream bike     Cons: Its over my budget by a couple grand (do-able, I’ll just feel guilty as hell and have to postpone other fun things), I’ve only owned 2 bikes, so I may not know what I really want to direct the builder, I could probably get something good enough for cheaper (but I couldn’t find anything that really struck a chord with me). I don't need it….its a bike, hell my canon dale still works. It can’t be 6000 dollars better. Can it?     I basically ride once to twice a week, 20-30 miles at a time. I don’t race. I’m not part of a club. I just like to go with myself and maybe one buddy. I’ve done some centuries/distance rides on my own. Thats pretty much my level. I ride for fun, its not a big group thing for me.   What do you guys think? Custom steel? Off the peg? go for it? Too much bike for me? I was looking at the ritchey swisscross (looks like it would be a good one) and the Ridley  x or nightfire (cross race bike I’d feel like a poser but damn it looks sweet and I love me a cross bike). I know those are both cross bikes, but I can’t find a good steel road bike that really hit me..besides the one this builder makes (Kirk Frameworks).Summary:
Summarize: So lately I have been playing a lot of Udyr. And I mean  a lot . As in only udyr for the last 3 days now. Mostly my interest was piqued because of his slight rework so I tried a few games out with him.   And he was awesome. Udyr is a lot more underrated then he appears, and requires a lot of decision making to play well.   But first, I'll give you the basic info on Udyr.   No ult  Udyr has no ult and this leads to some really unique gameplay and decision making opportunities. All of his skills are able to be leveled up 5 times, which means by 18 one skill will only have 3 points in it. This means he has a lot more decision making that is inherently required to play him well, but also allows him to be one of the more reactive champions out there, being able to level up which skill makes him into what his team needs most   pre-rework  I'll admit, udyr was pretty weak. He was fun, and on paper his skills looked like they were strong, but in game play they fell short. A move speed boost with a stun? thats great...unless they have an escape. A shield that gives sustain works great on lee sin right? Lee sin has better base stats and is able to apply that shield to a team mate. In short his kit looked like an A+ but felt like a B-.   Reworked Udyr  Now, I know Riot often tends to want to ballance champs towards the underpowered side, then on the overpowered side, but at first I felt like this rework was uncalled for and honestly, a little bit silly, and honestly, worse. Removing bonus armor/mr for 5 ms? bad. Turtle no longer restores mana? Even poorer sustain. Increase the ms boost from bear is good and all, but decrease the duration? ugh. No more bonus AP/AD from phoenix? You're killing me riot.   But I was so wrong. Two skills that give me an AS and MS steroid, plus a stun and a mini leap, synergising with his passive, which is basically a weaker form of those two skills? More powerful then I expected. I'll admit that the last few days his Q and E felt much more powerful then before the rework. I think that actually, he is even more fun now then he was previously, and this was definitely a good rework for him.   But he still isn't perfect. At this point if almost feels like because his Q and E have become so much more powerful, and considering the nerfs to W and R, there really isn't much point in taking R after 3 or 4 points in E, and W is pretty useless. He lost that ability to be reactive to the enemies.   My solution  Each skill has a persistent and an activation effect. The persistent behaving exactly as a passive would as long as that skill is active, and each skill granting an additional effect for the first few seconds it is active.   Give each skill a passive, that scales with its level and is active even when the skill is not. For example each level of tiger would give an additional 1% AS per level. Turtle would give an additional 2 armor/mr per level. Bear would give an addition 1-2 MS per level, and Phoenix would give maybe 2% crit chance per level. These are just examples, and they wouldn't need to stack with the persistent effects of having the skills active. I think this would open up a lot more diverse ways to play udyr, since leveling up one skill benefits you even when you don't have it active.   Disclaimer  I know that its hard to compare udyr's skills with those of other champions because his skills are much more diverse and unique then any other champions, which I love about him. However because of this it is hard to make accurate comparisons to other champs/skills because of this.Summary:
Summarize: My Observations:     There are very few subreddits where you get a genuine mix of political opinions. Generally speaking, political thought sticks to the subreddits most sympathetic to it. That being said, one of the best mixing pots is /r/AdviceAnimals and one of the worst is /r/politics. /r/PoliticalDiscussion is somewhere in the middle, as it has a tendency to devolve into thread-by-thread circlejerks, flamewars, downvote brigades and "no-you're-stupid "debates" ".     Active commenters about politics generally speaking come in two flavors: progressive and libertarian. There are almost no outspoken social conservatives or foreign policy hawks, and even among libertarians, support for the free market is undercut by "left-libertarians" who are really just anarcho-socialists. With this being said, its small surprise that most of Reddit identifies as Democrat, and the Republicans are just the worst.     Political issues that have strong support in the academic community are the ones most likely to have fervent, almost irrational support, from the liberal crowd. They will pick any of these as a hill to die on, and not accept any criticism or skepticism. By this I mean things like:   -Anthropogenic Global Warming   -Feminism/Affirmative Action   -Externality Theory/Keynesian Economics   -Support for the Welfare State     When it comes to Obama and Co., people seem to come in three flavors. Those who were against him from the start, those who are disappointed, and those who are still on board and passing around the Koolaid.Summary:

Should I just go red dot?   Aside from tossing in a cleaning kit, a brick of .22, and maybe a sling, are there any handy accessories I'm forgetting/you wish you had?     Basically I'm looking for a .22 that is a bit tacticool but that's a step up from a range toy.

Summarize: Sorry for the wall of text, thank you to all who read and give their input   So a few weeks ago friends and I went to the local bar where we are local regulars and stayed for a few hours, we all left together to go smoke cigars. I came back after an hour or 2 to meet up with a girl I knew, we went in and the cocktail waitress was working, her and I started up a conversation and she pulled up a chair and we kept talking while the girl I was with just got out her phone and started texting. We talked about a local brewery and their beer. I felt bad so I ended the convo and turned back to the girl I brought. We later left girl I brought asked me to come home with her but since I wouldn't have a ride home in the morning I declined   Went back to the same bar the next week and started talking to the cocktail waitress again. Walked in and was met with other regulars that all got up and gave me hugs etc. One of her coworkers was off for the night but in to have a few drinks asked me to dance so got up in the middle of the crowded bar and danced for a few mins before sitting back down. As the night ended I asked the waitress when we were going to have the beers we talked about the weekend before. She vanished into the bars kitchen for a second and came back with a piece of paper with her schedule on it, so I handed her my phone and got her name/number. Texted her about 20 mins later saying it was me and she texted back when she got off how I made her night better.   There was small chat through text the next day set up a date on monday for thursday of last week. Her texts are always slow which is fine just different than what normally happens.   Fast forward to Thursday I show up to pick her up from work about 10 mins early, sit in the back pull out my phone and jump on reddit. She gets my attention and has me sit by her while she finishes up her shift. Go out to dinner and it was awesome, Sat at dinner had steady conversation about everything, eye contact, kino the whole works. Get done with dinner ask her if she wants to go out, she does. Wants to go back to the bar where she works (think this is to test me to see if i can handle the attention she gets since it was a busy night at the bar) We stop by her place so she can change out of her work clothes, met her sister. On the way to the bar she talks about how she can cook all my fav food and wants to. Went to the bar talked to her friends and regulars. Walking in I let her go up to the bar and grab a seat while i stood and talked to one of her regulars about sports then came up and sat next to her.   At the bar she said the guy next to her creeped her out so i pulled her closer to me, when i left and came back squeezed her shoulders as i cut in and she gave me that omg dont stop look. Anyways we leave around midnight her and her friend are going to another bar and I declined since I had to work at 5 and had a 30 min drive home. She gave me a hug and as I pulled away she kept her arms tight and looked up at me and I tilted my head she mirrored me. Think I could of went for a goodnight kiss but didnt since half of her coworkers were out on break and I went out with one of them and she was hating on me all night.   So this is where I get confused I texted her the next day about how I had a great night and I'm excited to try her cooking. Heard nothing back until I went up there and we ran into her on break outside the bar She smiled and waved but no one wanted to pay cover so we kept going then she started texting me about how we should fix this food craving I was having lol So as the night goes on I get a little sloppy and we start texting back and forth pretty quickly no more hour long waiting periods for her to respond. Talk about how I am going back up at 5 to tailgate the football game and I should try to wake her up to come along with us. Texted her around 10 never heard from her then my phone died and when I got it charged I had a missed text from her. From then on havent really talked Tried to set up a date for tonight on monday said she would check her schedule, then she had to close so I asked when she didnt have to close and havent gotten a response back from her since. I know I will see her at the bar this weekend and I am really into her, shes one of the coolest girls I've metSummary:

Summarize: I was on exchange in Germany with two others from my university. I'm originally from Germany but came to the US when I was only 3 and just wanted to see where I was from. Anyways, we were put up by some really amazing but very old timey German family for a week while we were there. As we were eating the first night they set out a huge dinner for us as a welcome. When we were seated and eating my two friends kept their arms off the table and under the table cloth in their laps (as is proper in the states). However these older Germans kept looking irritated at them. Their son, about 35-36, later told me that back in their time (30s-40s) it was considered the practice of traitors to keep their hands below the table as it showed they were usually trying to hide something (notepad, recording device, gun? etc.). He said that it's not practiced much anymore and he cleared it up for us as he knew it was a formality in the US and knew they were trying to be polite but I passed the message along.Summary:
Summarize: So basically if you told me last year that I would throw away my social life for video games I would punch you in the dick and get the whole 200 kids that went to my school to come laugh at you. I am 14 years old and live in a small town in Ontario of like 5000 people, and basically everyone plays hockey. Of course I was one of those kids and TBH I was one of the better hockey players out there which of course put me on the popularity charts. I was the star of my old school, but it only goes up to grade 6, so after that we move up to "the big school on the hill." It's not a big deal because everybody knows everybody no matter what school you went to so that means that everyone knew I was no force to be triffled with. The end of grade 7 was when I started playing lots of computer. There was this kid in my class who didn't go to my old school and I had no idea who he was so I started talking to him and he was actually really smart. We both found out we play computer games (I only really played minecraft with  . who wanted to play with me before) but then he introduced me to Steam. It was wonderful! All these games!! Me and this kid I had never talked to in my life all of the sudden became bestest of friends through the computer. Everybody else thought he was a nerd and thought the only real video game out there was CoD. One day me and this boy were looking through steam to find any Co - op games that we could play for free because we were both broke and we stumbled upon Dota 2. I never played any sort of MMO or MOBA or anything with wizards and warlock and what not. I remember my first game like it was yesterday. I thought that the person I picked would be my permanent character and I had to chose wisely, so I clicked the random button. I was Bristleback. The hedgehog? I wasn't really satisfied with my pick but whatever I entered the game. We were radiant but that didn't matter because I didn't know either sides of the map. We had to buy items and I thought that what ever item we bought would like cosmetically change my character so I bought some boots. I'm not really sure how the game went and I actually didn't really like it that much so I unistalled it so I could play a different game on my computer (it's really shitty and has no memory). It sat in my steam library still and after watching many YouTube videos, I decided I'd give it another shot. (TY Purge) I was actually pretty decent at the game thanks the Purge but I still new nothing about the game or that there was a pro scene and people actually make money off of it. By that point I had spent way to much time inside and I had ditched to many sleepovers playing Dota so slowly but surely I sank far from the top of my school, which I now give 0 shits about. After learning that Arteezy is only 18 and from Canada (not meaning to make this an EG fan boy post) I knew that I could actually have a shot playing Dota. If you can't tell I am really bad at English and I suck at telling stories (unless I am making excuses) please ask me anything you want to know or I left out.Summary:
Summarize: Forgive me if this is long, but this needs a bit of a back story. I'm a 25 year old guy (about to be 26 in a month) and have been looking to move out of my parents' house for awhile, and I finally have the funds to be able to do it.   Here's where things get tricky: in the past I've talked with both of my parents about moving in with my girlfriend of 6 years, but both are extremely disapproving of it. We have a great relationship and when we were attending the same college, we pretty much lived together anyway, so I don't have any worries about anything going wrong in that aspect. In my area, I could get a small, single bedroom apartment and live by myself - but I would be really stretching myself financially. However, if I lived with her and we were to share the bills, we would both be able to live pretty comfortably.   Her parents have no problems with us living together. Her mom was actually surprised when my girlfriend told her that my parents were so disapproving. I guess I'm just afraid of hurting my mom - she's not really religious but has some really weird old-fashioned viewpoints. I've tried to have multiple discussions with her about it and tried to present my side calmly and in the best way possible, but it usually ends with her saying "I don't want to talk about it" after 10 seconds of me speaking.   I guess my question would be - at what point do you just say forget it and bite the bullet and move out, no matter what your parents say? My girlfriend and I have been fortunate enough to find good jobs out of college, so we're financially stable with a decent amount in savings. Both our cars are paid off and we're able to pay student loans with no problems. Has anyone been in a similar situation where their parents didn't approve of their plans to move out? How did it go?Summary:

Summarize: So I've had to answer this a few times and I'm getting tired of so many people asking this question without searching for the answer beforehand. Here's the question:   "So do I do the false ending at the beginning of X Chapter? What's the best time? Can I do the true ending then go back and do the false? DO I RESTART THE GAME?"   So the way the endings work is let's say you're in chapter 5 (when the false is available at first), any crystal from that point on can be used in order to trigger the false ending. What both endings do is take you out of your current chapter and put you into the FINAL chapter.   What happens after you finish the FINAL chapter, is it puts you back to the beginning of whatever chapter you were doing when you got the ending. So for the true ending, it puts you back at the beginning of Chapter [] (#s "8"), and for the false ending it will put you back at the beginning of whatever chapter you accessed it on. So if you started it at chapter 5 and you beat the false ending, you go back to the beginning of chapter 5. All you have to do is reawaken the crystals to continue the game after either ending.   THIS GAME IS CONTINUABLE AFTER EACH ENDING.   You can do the true ending, then the false ending, because after the true ending it puts you back to the beginning of chapter [] (#s "8"), where you can just go and do the thing you do with a crystal to get the false ending.   NEW GAME + DOES NOT WRITE OVERWRITE YOUR FINISHED SAVE, IT TAKES A SEPARATE SLOT UNLESS YOU MANUALLY SAVE OVER YOUR COMPLETED GAME   Thank you. There should be no spoilers aside from the fact that there are more than one ending in this game, but we all know that.Summary:
So I've had to answer a few times and I'm tired of so many people asking this question without looking for the answer beforehand. Here's the question: "So, I'm making the false end at the beginning of chapter X? What's the best time? Can I make the real end then go back and make the false? Am I RESTART THE GAME? So the way the work of ends is said that you are in chapter 5 (when the false is available at the beginning), any crystal from that point can be used to trigger the false end. What the two ends bring you out of your current chapter and put you in the FINAL chapter.
SAMMER: So I have to answer this a few times, and I get tired of so many people looking for this question without the answer before. Here's the question: "How do I make the wrong end at the beginning of X chapter? What is the best time? Can I go back the true end then and do the wrong end? DO I RESTART THE GAME?" So, the way the ends work is like we say you are in chapter 5 (if the wrong chapter is at first), each crystal can be used from that point back to trigger the wrong end. So for the true end, it brings you back at the beginning of chapter [#s "8"), but for the wrong end it should be you back to the beginning of each chapter you do when you finish the end. So, you do when you start to chapter 5 and you hit, after the end of chapter [#s "8".
SUMME: I have had to answer a few times and I am tired of so many people asking this question without looking for the answer beforehand. Here's the question: "So, I'm making the wrong end at the beginning of chapter X? What's the best time? Can I make the real end then turn around and do the wrong? Am I RESTART THE GAME? So the way the work of ends is said that you are in chapter 5 (when the false is available at the beginning), any crystal from this point can be used to trigger the false end. What the two ends bring you out of your current chapter and put you in the FINAL chapter.
Summarize: Right but my point is that we don't know that it is unhealthy for dogs to do it. We just prefer them not to. How can we judge animals for certain behaviors if we do not actually understand it.Summary:
Let's sum up: Yes, but my point is that we don't know it's unhealthy for dogs to do it. We just prefer that they don't. How can we judge animals for certain behaviors if we don't really understand it.

Summarize: DVD-As and especially SACDs tend to be some of the best versions. Even if it's a hybrid SACD and you're only listening to the standard CD portion, it will probably be superior because you're hearing the mix that they made for the SACD which is often the best mix. Also, I enjoy the Japanese SHM-CD releases, which are often well-mastered, and the K2 or XRCD releases, which are designed to make the Redbook CD format sound as good as it can. Vinyl is another matter, and some prefer vinyl to CD. The good thing about vinyls is that due to the limitations of the format, there is no room for altering the sound or adding compression, etc. so you know that what you're hearing is the original sound. Personally, I think that the best format is either SACD (which unfortunately has a limited number of devices that can play it properly) or Blu-ray (which is not being utilized much at all as a format for releasing albums).Summary:

Summarize: Hello /r/legaladvice,   I am attempting to sell my house and purchase my new one, however I am having a problem obtaining my mortgage due to an erroneous record by my bank. In August, my mortgage broker stated that we would have a hard time obtaining a mortgage because the bank (mistakenly) reported missed mortgage payments for 120 days. I had in fact paid my mortgage every month on time, and usually more than required.   The bank refused to acknowledge the error when I would call or talk to them in person. In September, my lawyer wrote to the bank and stated that I am in the process of selling and buying a new home and unable to obtain a mortgage because of the false report. Further, the letter mentioned that the bank was jeopardizing the potential value of my current home, and were advised to fix the negative credit information within 30 days. After a few weeks, we got notification that the internal investigation had concluded and the credit reporting agencies were alerted of the correction.   In November, I found my new house and proceeded into contract. My mortgage company stated I was okay, I could proceed, and we would work on getting the mortgage in December. My buy/sell date was on or around January 10th. The first week of January, I was notified by the mortgage broker that there were problems obtaining the mortgage, but we would work on it. Long story short, I just found out today that one of the three CRAs are still reporting the erroneous negative record. The broker said that the CRA stated the bank never reported anything to them and were unwilling to remove the negative mark with just a verbal confirmation. The broker told me that the fastest way to resolve this would be to dispute the CRA, not the bank, but after some due-diligence, I found that it may take up to 45 days for it to be resolved through the CRA.   The buyer's want to close on the house and the seller's are asking what is the problem. I might have to close on my house ASAP and lose the new house and my deposit. If I am unable to purchase the new home, I would have to store all my furniture and rent an apartment/hotel until this resolves.   Is the bank at fault here? From my laymen understanding of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, I believe that the bank negatively affected my opportunity at purchasing a house. After advising the bank of the error, we asked them to fix the error in 30 days. After concluding the investigation, the bank stated the error would be resolved and removed from the report. Two of the reporting agencies removed the error, however, the third one states that the bank did not notify, thus the agency will not remove it. From my understanding, if I lose my deposit and the house, I could argue that I was damaged by the bank.   I am aware that legal matters with a bank are iffy and this problem probably occurs often.  Do I have standing to write to the bank to possibly expedite fixing the error?   Thanks.Summary:

The house buying the mortgage and the house buying the real estate property. In August, my mortgage agent stated that it would cost us a lot of time to get a mortgage because the bank (mistokenly) reported failed mortgage payments for 120 days. In fact, I had paid my bank to the mortgage on time, and usually more than required. The bank refused to recognize the mistake when I would call or talk to them in person. In September, my lawyer wrote to the bank and stated that I am in the process of selling and buying a new bank. After a few weeks, we were given notice that the internal investigation had been completed and the credit agencies were notified of the sale of the real estate property more than what is said in the report. In November, I was told that my new house and proceeded in the contract. My mortgage company stated that it was okay, I could proceed, and we found the mortgage on the December date that the problems of selling the real estate property were fulfilled.
Summarize: Thinking about picking up an xbox one tomorrow and my other half has issues with kinect being always on (she's been reading the propaganda). I'm really interested in the voice control aspect on kinect, especially the "record that" function and was wondering if those that already have one know if it's possible to turn the camera off but leave the mic on? The only thing I could find online was saying that the opposite was possible i.e. Mic off, camera on.Summary:

Summarize: A large majority of it is how much hipsters deny being hipsters, because of how much people in general seem to dislike them. A lot of larger cities (e.g. Madison, WI or the entire states of Washington and Oregon) seem to have large populations of hipsters because larger cities seem to beckon those who want to fit into recent trends. Oddly enough, the one time I was in Indianapolis, for such a large city, a surprisingly small population of hipsters. I don't think I ran into a single one while I was there. But back on topic, hipsters tend to be rather hypocritical, in that they claim to want to be unique and non-conformist, but they aren't unique, and they are conforming to a rather popular trend. And, often "uber-hipsters" will do things like, type-writing in a park, listening to vinyls on portable record players, or listening to lots of Mumford and Sons while pretending they're some kind of underground musical group (those of you who listen to, and enjoy, M&S without having some delusion that they are an unheard-of musical group, I'm not calling you a hipster, and are likely not one at all). Also, those examples I listed are all things I have witnessed hipsters do. It's an obnoxious trend, and many do these things to be counter-cultural intentionally, but have instead become part of a much larger culture. Now, in defence of hipsters, I have yet to meet a hipster, who also willingly admitted to being a hipster, that I didn't like. Those willing to admit they are hipsters have been, in my experience, very pleasant people, and don't tend to be as obnoxious about being a hipster. I don't know how prominent it is in other areas yet, but I have noticed a new growing trend within hipster culture of self-labeling as "indie" in order to separate themselves from hipsters, because, again, they aren't willing to admit they are hipsters, and want to separate themselves from the culture. Right now, if I knew anything about sociology, I would think hipster culture would be extremely fascinating to study.Summary:
I don't know what's more important, but I don't know how there are more and more hipsters, more and more hipsters, more and more hipsters, more and more hipsters, more and more hipsters, more and more hipsters, more and more hipsters, more and more hipsters, more and more hipsters, more and more hipsters, more and more hipsters, more and more hipsters, more and more hipsters, more and more hipsters, more and more hipsters, more and more hipsters, more and more hipsters, more and more hipsters, more and more hipsters, more and more hipsters, more and more hipsters, more and more hipsters, more and more hipsters, more and more hipsters, more and more hipsters, more and more hipsters, more and more hipsters.
I'm willing to do this that it's a large majority of them who are hipper themselves. I know how much people in general seem to hate them. Many larger cities (e.g. Madison, WI or the whole states of Washington and Oregon) seem to have large populations of hipsters because larger cities seem to wave those who want to fit into the latest trends. Strangely enough, the one time I was in Indianapolis, for such a large city, a surprisingly small population of hipsters. I don't think I'm in a single trend. And, often "over-hipsters" will do things like, type-writing in a park, listening to vinyls on portable record players, or hearing many of Mumford and Sons are not unique, and they're to do some kind of underground group that they have an unreliable culture that doesn't enjoy.
A large majority of them are how many hipsters deny they are hipsters, because of the number of people in general they seem not to like. Many larger cities (e.g. Madison, WI or the entire states of Washington and Oregon) seem to have large hipster populations because the larger cities seem to attract those who want to fit in with recent trends. Occasionally, the only time I was in Indianapolis, for such an obformist city, a surprisingly small hipster population. I don’t think I found a fairly popular trend while I was there. But, again on the subject, hipsters tend to be quite hypocritical, in that they say they want to be unique and non-conformist, but they are not unique, and they agree with a fairly popular trend.
Summarize: So I was just dumped about 4 weeks ago after a 4 year relationship. I obviously still love the girl and very much want to get back with her.   The reason she ended things with me was because she went through my phone and saw that I had told one of my friends that another girl was hot and I would get with her. I was not actually serious about it but due to my past (cheated once, immediately told her and she stayed with me), she decided to end things with me, saying that she couldn't trust me and didn't want to get hurt again.   There's about 5 months left until we both graduate and I would really like to spend the last 5 months of my senior year with her. I obviously still love her and she told me that she still loved me and was still in love with me, but didn't want to worry about me texting other girls. So essentially, she doesn't trust me anymore. Despite our breakup, we remained great friends and still tell each other everything. Our friendship now is very close and it's like we're dating except there's no intimacy.   I asked her how she could still love me but didn't want to be more than friends and she told me that a relationship is more than just feelings. We still hangout several times a week and text every night.   I want her back as my girlfriend and I know I messed up. Does anyone have any advice on how to get her back? How to build trust again?   The reason I don't want to move on is that despite being in immense pain now, I don't want to end my senior year thinking back and regretting not trying to get her back. It hurts now, it's going to hurt when we graduate, so might as well go all in.   Any advice on getting back would be greatly appreciated!Summary:

I don't want to do it more than I want me to take care of her. I won't worry about being with her anymore.

Summarize: I can relate though I'm getting pissed off with myself for constantly passing up the low when it presents itself and cashing out say  right now  and make about 40% profit or so. But I was just not confident enough to call the bottom, especially when it's doing a soft bouncy motion downwards rather than just one swift, sharp cut down. For all I know I could go all in at say 460, then with my luck it'll go up a bit, then bounce down to 300 and stay there.   It's doing the same thing now when it crashed to 550 just the weekend before last. It bounced straight up and "stabilised" before crashing once again a few days later, then epic crashing last night. That's why I'm pretty nervous calling either bottom or high or even stable mean at this point. I'm holding off because I've been burned in the last few weeks buying as it's going up, only to get reamed because it crashes again.Summary:
Summarize: I can tell you that I was pissed off by myself for constantly passing the bottom when it comes up and cashed by saying now and making about 40% profit or so. But I wasn't confident enough to call the bottom, especially when it makes a soft rebound motion down rather than a simple quick and sharp cut. For all I know, I could go all over to say 460, then with my luck, it's going to climb a little, then bounce to 300 and stay there.

Summary: Although I can get along with myself, because I'm constantly letting the low pass when it presents itself and pays off, let's say now and make about 40% profit or something. But I was just not confident enough to call the ground, especially if it does a soft bouncing move down, rather than just a quick, sharp cut. Everything I know I could go all in saying 460, then with my luck it will go up a little, then jump to 300 and stay there.

Summarize: Part of the big hate, at least from a pure technological standpoint, is that Windows has become bulky over the years.  With each new iteration, they make it work better on newer technology, but when it comes to running games and such the Windows OS is extremely bogged down by many, many layers of drivers and coding that it takes a lot more to run things than it feasibly should, and all because every Microsoft OS is built on top of the previous one.Summary:
Summarize: Long ago I switched to Mac. It wasn't a decision based on preference, but a decision based on my career. I work in a field that is predominantly Mac, so I made the switch completely so that I wouldn't hinder my learning by just booting into a Windows partition on my Mac. I used to be into building rigs, but its been well over 7 years since I've built a computer. I've been completely left behind by new technologies, and I don't even know where to start in order to build a new PC.   This year's Steam Holiday Sale got me thinking, and I really want a new PC. My budget isn't too high, 500-600 ish, and I'm looking for things on the cheap. I don't have anything... No monitor, keyboard, mouse, case, mobo, gfx card, etc. I'm just wondering if anyone on here could help me put together a list of parts that can play some newer releases, but I don't expect it to be a powerhouse. I don't need a version of Windows, so don't worry about adding that into the costs. I just want a PC that is able to play on decent settings in newer games.   I don't want this to start a Mac vs PC flame war, and it isn't about 1 being better than the other. They are both good at certain things, and yes Macs are ridiculously overpriced.Summary:

Summarize: theoretically infinite   In theory, but not in practice. Bit depth affects the dynamic range and the signal to noise ratio of digital recordings, which are also two very important characteristics of tape.   Tape has much worse dynamic range and much lower signal to noise ratio than 16 bit digital recordings. It is reasonable to calculate the calculate the equivalent bit depth of a analog recording based on its dynamic range. The equivalent bit depth of a cassette deck could well be in the 6 to 12 bit range. This is based the 6 db per bit figure mentioned in the link below and a educated estimate that cassette decks offer from around 40 to 70 db of dynamic range.Summary:
Summarize: Not entirely sure why this is on /r/adventuretime really (except for the many shared habits of the fanbases), but I'll give my two cents.   I've watched the show, it isn't bad and I enjoyed most of it. I really like cartoons in general and this one is pretty damn good (all star cast, emmy-nominated songs, surprisingly relatable characters, sight-gag filled active animation)... But I'll never get the way the fanbase acts about it. I don't understand where the huge leap occurs between liking a show and self-identifying as a brony and turning it into a secret club with special emoticons and hidden pony avatars. They are also some of the worst shippers in the history of mankind. Just because the main cast is all female they're all lesbian to the worst parts of the fanbase, even when they're shown not to be. Don't get me started on the fact that Rule 34 for it is so prevalent that it even has its own name. ಠ_ಠ   What is wrong with leaving something that is simple alone? Watching a show doesn't have to be a life philosophy and there doesn't have to be a romantic subplot between the main characters to enjoy it the way it is. At least in Adventure Time the majority of bad ships have expressed some romantic interest in Finn (mostly because he is a celebrity) so they aren't pulling something from nothing. Also every side character (even the stock ones that they just use to populate crowds) that is shown seems to be given a fandom name, fandom ships, and some crazy obsession or personality trait. This puts the creators, who are active in the community to some extent, in the awkward position of only having two choices: letting the fanbase write for them in blatant fanservice (often killing a joke to please the fans, like with  Ditzy Doo  Derpy) or "betraying" the "fanon" in a way that for some reason seems a similarly outrageous offense to punching a fan's mother. In most fanbases it's considered a somewhat funny in-joke when the creators stomp all over fanon (especially Adventure Time), but some people are WAY too involved in their nonexistent characters and would probably flip shit if, for example, a certain background pony's name was revealed to be anything but Octavia.Summary:
Summarize: Not quite sure why it is on /r/adventuretime really (except for the many shared habits of fanbases), but I'm going to give my two hundred.

But I'll never have the way the fanbase acts on this. I don't understand where the huge leap goes between loving a show and identifying itself as a brony and turning it into a secret club with special emoticons and hidden pony avatars. They're also some of the worst senders of human history.

Summarize: Alright here is my situation. On the Friday that spring break started, my very first board as well as my first home made board cracked from the nose to about 2/3 the way to the end of the deck (sadness ensued) and the deck is 42 inches long so as you can imagine, it was a very sizable crack. (I have a temporary replacement thanks to one of my friends being awesome) My dad and I (I'm a high school student with no job currently) had an agreement that he will buy me a new board+as much gear as possible for a total of $100 U.S. (a deck is mandatory and say if it was $70, I could get other gear such a bearings or wheels for the difference) IF I can get my grades up by the end of the year. (They aren't bad but they aren't straight A's) I'm really interested in learning how to slide (thanks to you guys) so I would like to optimize my new setup for sliding. Links to where I can get what I'm looking for for the least amount of money+shipping would be VERY helpful.Summary:
On Friday, the spring break started, my first board and my first homemade board cracked from the nose at about 2/3 the way to the end of the bridge (save followed) and the bridge is 42 inches long, so you can imagine, it was a very important crack. (I have a temporary replacement thanks to one of my friends being great) My father and I (I am a currently unemployed high school student) agreed that he would buy me a new board + as much equipment as possible for a total of $100 US. (a bridge is mandatory and say if it was $70, I could get other equipment such a bearing or wheels for the difference) IF I can get my grades by the end of the year. (They're not bad but they're not right A's) I'm really interested in learning to slide (thank you guys) so I would like to optimize my new configuration to slide.
Summarize: Very well here is my situation. On Friday that spring break started, my first board, as well as my first board made house broke from the nose around 2/3 the road to the end of the deck (sadness occurred) and the deck is 42 inches long so you can imagine, was a very considerable crack. (I have a temporary replacement thanks to which one of my friends is awesome) My father and I (I am a high school student without work currently) had an agreement that he will buy me a new board + equipment as big as possible for a total of $100 U.S. (a cover is mandatory and say that if it was $70, I could get another team such bearings or wheels for the difference) IF I can get my grades for the end of the year. (They are not bad but they are not straight A's) I am very interested in learning to slide (thanks to you guys) so I would like to optimize my new configuration to slip.
Summarize: Who I am/Why I left     &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hello, I am Tluers. I played hockey? every day for about a year and then I stopped when I got a job, changed schools, and started playing league of legends. I didn't put enough practice time in and tried changing roles which led to me being a backup backup player for LHL teams. I switched to playing ranked teams in League of Legends to get my competitive team play fix.     What I did in Hockey?     Team Accomplishments     &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I was never really great at Hockey?, but I have been on a lot of great teams:     2x LHL Champion (S1, S2)     2x HQML Champion (S2, S4)     4x HQML Finalist (S2, S3, S4, S5)         In the LHL S1 I blind picked one of the best teams and for LHL S2 I was allowed to keep the core of the team together (KS Otto and Tim_Barrett).   I was also lucky to be friends with some of the better players so I got invited to play on their HQML teams.     Individual Accomplishments     &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I got best GM Season 1 and that is because I got lucky with a trade and who ended up getting good at the game.   I also got to fill in for the first 2 all star games because people didn't show. I got a hat trick in one of them, I think.     Community Contributions     I used to do a weekly highlights video. It was pretty cringe so i'll let someone else link it if they want.   I also made Jerseys and Ice textures for people. Those too were pretty bad.   I streamed/commentated over some LHL games too.     Reasons against me being GM     &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I put thought into whether or not I could be a good GM or not this season. Reasons that set me back from the other applicants are lack of 5v5 experience, lack of experience with newer players, and lack of in-game skill relative to other players.   &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;While I don't have much experience with 5v5, I was one of the biggest proponents for switching from 4v4 to 5v5. I would argue for it at GM meetings and tried starting a 5v5 tournament. I played 15 games season 7. I didn't perform well but I knew why and I understood how the game was played. I have watched more recent games too and feel I have an understanding of how the game is played.   &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;While I haven't played with or seen a lot newer players, I have watched games and followed the stats sheets to see who has gotten better/worse. I also talk to a couple of people who still play regularly to see who to follow.   &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;While my in-game skill may not be LHL starter, I can see myself being a back up player. I still do play the game about 3-4 hours a week, but recently it has been more than that. With enough practice I may be able to be a starting goalie again.     Reasons to vote for me to be GM     While I did take a break from competitive Hockey?, I did play team League of Legends. I have mostly ran the teams that I have played on in League of Legends. Skills from league that transfer over to GM in Hockey? are:     Creating practice/game schedule that fits the team     Analyzing game footage/facilitating discussion on team/ individual play styles     Knowing when to make roster changes for the team even though it may cause an awkwardness in my personal relationships.     Understanding the different roles needed for a team. Having a balanced roster.       Here is also a list of people who have played for me that have said they endorse my run for GM: KS Otto, Goose, Molting Duck, Bojarzin, Stu Walton, and Leafs (43Kadri). If you wish to be added to this list leave a comment.Summary:

Summarize: Steven vs. Amethyst. I'm thinking that Amethyst will be brainwashed into joining Yellow Diamond's or the other Diamonds' side. This is very likely because in On The Run Amethyst completely lost herself into fighting pearl because she was so outraged by the fact that she was a Kindergarten gem. Most likely the other Kindergarten gems (peridot,jasper[uncomfirmed,theory]) will brainwash Amethyst and Steven is the only hope to get Amethyst back in the Crystal Gems or atleast stop hurting Earth.Summary:

Summarize: So, background.   I’m 20 year living overseas on one-year university exchange. I come from a latin country, my english is good but I stutter sometimes. I have been in a LTR since 15 until I moved here, so very little experience with game.   On the looks department, I’m skinny, not very tall (178cm 138lbs), thin arms and shoulders, and two things that bother me a lot: a. I can’t grow a fucking beard. Honestly, with all the ‘beards are sexy’ ‘beards equal sex’ hype going on this is a fucking downer. Every guy my age wears one. and b. I’m a serious dude and I hate smiling. I’m insecure about my teeth, I mean, I think I’m actually handsome while keeping a straight face, but look ugly when smiling. Its quite polarising. I’m even considering putting on braces again when returning to my home country.   On the game department, I absolutely suck at day/bar/club game. Specially the latter, maybe because I don’t stand out, am not confident enough, look too young, etc. Most of the girls I’ve hooked up with apart from my 4-year LTR were somehow from my social circle, I locked them down, made some sweet talk here and there if I get some IOI, I isolated them and closed. I have tried cold approaching, I get easily past the AA but I get turned down/get IODs every fucking time, maybe I’m being too outcome-dependent, who knows? I can get some good openers and maybe make her laugh, but I can’t escalate past that, even if I get some IOIs.   There’s a whole social circle of (female) exchange students that I know just waiting to get fucked, I’ve seen guys with SMV lower than mine hook up with 7 and 8’s, but it’s being really hard for me. Sometimes I think it is simply because I’m not confident enough (I feel myself overwhelmed by competition), or can’t present myself as a sexual being, when I make my intentions clear, I just feel creepy. I tried not giving a fuck, but if you aren’t super attractive women won’t present themselves, you have to actively go after them, but when I do that, I feel I’m being needy or emanating a scarcity feeling. It can’t be that hard, I just want to get fucking laid!! It’s been 7 months, ugh! I can't even write this post properly.   Sorry for the rant and the long post, but do you have any suggestions or just reads based on that situation?   Note: Before anyone says something, I am currently lifting, eating well, reading, generally self-improving, but results aren’t immediate.Summary:
Summarize: well sup this is my first post so yeah if it sucks sorry in advance Well I'm going to get straight into this i'm 13 at the time and my friend ( changed name ) ''john'' is about the same ages one day i was really sad and depressed and said fuck this i'm going out for a cycle then about a few mins down the road i see my friend john he is out playing football nothing different or strange about him at that point so i went up to him said hi ect talked about metal gear you know friend stuff ? and I told him how i was feeling and he was like ''bro bro bro bro '' my brother ( about 16 at the time ) got this stuff that could help you out man I thought about it for a second and said .. um okay so i went inside and played some ps3 as I was waiting for him when he came back he had rolled joint and i said fuck no i'm not gona smoke that man no way. so at that point another friend ''bob'' enters and then bob and john pass it back and forth,back and forth ( they didn't pressure me into it ) and when i saw how happy the two of them where and I was feeling really shity I thought to my self I don't want to feel shit so i took it and bam it hit me and i coughed and then passed it hit it again and nothing happened so the next day I was also down in the dumps so I hit it again we where listening to music and i could FEEL it like a visualizer ? and everything seemed different taste, touch and sight was a lot different but I swallowed some and when I burped smoke came out i guess its cool but i got sick so that wasn't any fun (and btw it did make me feel better i have read if you feel depressed and smoke it makes it worse but not for me i guess im lucky :L ) i don't do it all the time only when i'm feeling really shity ( messed up family ) i don't do it much for the sake of it but the feeling of ''been high'' but yeah the experience is good i guess, all my senses are enhanced witch is a good feeling my friend ''john'' is the person who gives it to me for free now (i'm now 15 ) anyway yeah sorry if that sucked it was my first post so yeah xDSummary:

Summarize: I'm trying to make chocolate ice cream that's similar to Ben and Jerry's chocolate ice cream they use in their Chocolate Fudge Brownie. It's not too sweet, and kind of...like...chewy, I guess is the word for it? I've made chocolate ice cream before quite a bit in the past but it seems to come out...dry. I don't think I'm using even remotely proper descriptors for ice cream, but hopefully someone here will understand what I'm vainly trying to say. Thanks!Summary:

Summarize: Hi AskWomen!   I hope this is the right subreddit--/r/fancyfollicles and /r/femalefashionadvice didn't quite seem to fit the bill.   I posted a few days ago in FFA about my work wardrobe--it's a new goal of mine to make over my work appearance. I work in a business casual and formal environment, and most of my clients are doctors, bankers, lawyers, CEO's, politicians, etc. You know the type--rich old American white males. I'm young--in my early twenties, and the youngest person in my workplace by about 10 years, and younger than most of our customers by at least thirty. On FFA's recommendation I ordered a few items to help me look a little more put-together and mature so that I am taken more seriously at work.   I'm excited for my new clothes and shoes, and that has left me some time to ponder my other attributes--mainly my makeup and hair. I'm proficient at makeup (holla at my girls over at /r/makeupaddiction) and sadly think I'll have to dial it down a little (good-bye, purple lips!) but I feel okay there.   What I'm worried about is my hair. My hair is long--when straight and down, it comes to my asscrack--and brunette. I wear it up in a ponytail or a bun most often, to keep it out of my face at work, but I worry that my ponytails are making me look like a college student. When I walk into events, I get looks like I'm a lost girlfriend of a younger associate, not the manager who organized the entire seminar.   I've noticed none of the women members we cater to have long hair, and I've even read a few articles condeming long hair.   Please help. I need to present myself in a professional and mature way, and I'm tired of treated like an intern, instead of one of the highest managers at my job.Summary:
Summarize: So this past week I was responsible for teaching a new hire at work, we'll call her Janet. During the second day, we started hitting it off and talking about our lives and found out we had a lot of similarities. I thought about asking her out, but hesitated.   While dating a co-worker isn't explicitly forbidden, it is definitely frowned upon, especially one that I was "mentoring." I have also been known to misread signals sometimes, so I didn't want to risk possible getting in trouble AND rejected at the same time.   I spent a few days thinking and decided, "Fuck it, I'm going to go for it." I knew Janet would be at an another co-worker's house tonight for a housewarming party, and I would make my move then. I got to the house and immediately sought her out, we started to flirt, but something was a little off/awkward. There was a guy hanging around her really close, and a little defensively.   A mutual friend that had gotten pretty close with Janet noticed, and pulled me aside. She asked I was interested in Janet, and I told her I was, but I was getting weird vibes. She told me that Janet was talking about me all last week, and was definitely interested, but felt like she was getting mixed signals from me. She said Janet was getting a little depressed about, and to cheer her up, she took Janet clubbing 2 days ago and introduced her to a guy friend. That was the guy at the party, and they apparently hit it off pretty well. It became an awkward situation for me cause the guy came to the party for Janet, so she couldn't really ditch him, and for only knowing each other a couple days they were surprisingly close already. My friend apologized and said that if she had know that I was for sure interested, she wouldn't have set her up with another guy.   So this is where I'm left. I do legitimately like this girl, and it is actually pretty rare for me to find someone I'm interested in. Do I just drop it issue? Hope that she and the new guy burn out quickly? Or should I tell her that I was in fact interested, but I didn't know how to handle the situation since we work together?Summary:
She realized that the situation was very difficult, but she realized that the situation was very difficult, that people felt very well, that people felt very well, that people felt very well, that people felt very well, that people felt very well, that they felt very well, that they felt very well, that they felt very well, that they felt very well, that they felt very well, that they felt well, that they felt very well, that they felt very well, that they felt very well, that they felt very well, that they felt very well, that they felt very well, that they felt very well, that they felt very well and that they felt very well, that they felt very well, that they felt very well.
Summarize: So I've never been in a relationship. Straight 26 year old European male, living in one of the largest cities in North America.   I'm halfway through a Ph.D in a theoretical science. I'm in great shape, I'm 6 foot 1, dress well, have been told by women that I'm very attractive. I play two instruments. I speak four languages. I practice a martial art. I love to cook and am quite good at it. I can hold a conversation easily, and smile often. I even garden (have a small place of my own with a tiny garden in front of it). I occasionally travel. I'm well-read, have watched a lot of popular shows (for conversational material) and know about a fair bit about current events. I volunteer every weekend.   Almost all of these things are things that I've done in the past several years in order to improve myself so that I could finally stop being alone. "Become someone who people want to be around." Well it hasn't worked. My loneliness is getting to the point of causing physical pain and other symptoms (consistent with clinical depression). If I can't find someone while mentally healthy, I can't imagine ever doing so while clinically depressed. But I just don't know what I can do.   The social trend in this city seems to be insular cliques. People don't really talk socially with strangers. Even at bars and parties people go in groups or pairs, and I feel extremely out of place being by myself with no other individuals there. When joining activity groups I have no issue forming superficial connections with people and getting along well for the purposes of that activity, but no one really takes much of an interest in me. I've asked some women out in case I was simply bad at reading romantic interest, but have been rejected every time. I've never been on a date.   I've tried online dating, but that was a soul-crushing experience in which I got tons of profile views, but no messages and no responses to any of my messages.   The amount of effort this requires is considerable, and the constant failure is starting to take its toll on my research and my health.Summary:
Summarize: I usually don't post my NSV, and I am the first person to down-play my weight loss because I have a lot more to lose. But today the woman at the front desk of my gym stopped me on the way out and said, "I was watching you today, and you look amazing! Corey (the owner of the gym) mentioned it when you were in the other night, and I just had to say something to you." Then she asked how much I lost and said "Well, you look great, do you feel good to?" And honestly I do! I don't notice the change too much in myself, but I felt fantastic that the gym staff is impressed with my progress so far. Motivated me all the more to keep going on the track I am.Summary:

Summarize: Title is pretty straight forward but I'll elaborate. I currently tank full clear hard modes in both EV and KP and my guild is currently 4/5 in Nightmare EV. As far as end game content goes I have seen it, at least enough to form, what I consider, valid opinions.   Primarily for class balance in my guild, I am considering leveling a Guardian to replace my Vanguard. Also to take a break from raiding as I'm sick of having to ORDER people to CC and use their threat dumps, they aren't bad players, they are just too laid back at times. Every little thing effects tanking, and if you're making my job harder, I'm going to hate you, because you're making my healers job harder, and I like to look after my healers because they keep me from being dead.   I fucked up 3rd phase Soa a couple of times the other night as well, which was pretty humbling, I have the utmost disgust for those pillars and an enormous amount of respect for tanks that can perfectly place Soa without missing a pillar, or taunt after mind trap. The camera is NOT my friend in that encounter.   Anyway... Is Guardian fun to tank with? I have doubts about Vanguard threat, though it could just be my tunnel visioned DPS. I have one at level 20 and would love to see it to 50, the story looks solid and the companions I have so far are fantastic.   However that all takes a backseat when making my decision as I hear a lot of talk about Guardians / Juggs being the underdog when compared to Vanguard / Powertech.   Shadow tank is out of the question because we have too many already.Summary:

Summarize: So after about 9 attempts or so, I finally managed to improve the nameless king. I noticed, however, that I fought much more with the king of storms than I did the nameless king. Of course, both were difficult, but the blocking in the KotS phase made it much harder and I ALWAYS noticed. On top of this, the nameless king telegraphed his movements heavily and seemed to act much more predictably than the KotS. Nameless king was responsible for 3 deaths while KotS caused 6. Does anyone else feel this?Summary:
Summarize: I've been seeing this guy (he's 24, I'm 22) for about a month and a half and things have been going really well. He's said that he's never felt like this about anyone so early on, and that he's never had such a laugh with a girl before. We can talk for hours and not get bored and we've been able to be really open about loads of things.   Usually I hear from him every day. I saw him last weekend; he dropped me off before going to see his mum, but then I didn't hear from him. I dropped him a quick message to ask how his day went the next day, and nothing. He'd read the message though which is completely unusual.   Eventually I sent him another one basically saying that if things had changed for him, I felt that I deserved a bit more than just being ignored; at least an explanation or something. He responded that night apologising for blanking me and saying he was an asshole, but some shit has hit the fan in his life and he's not really known how to deal with it.   I said that I understood, but also mentioned that I'd been a bit upset after being left to wonder what was going on. He said (again after a long wait) that he was so sorry and that he knew it was upsetting, but he just needs a few days to pull himself together.   I'm really confused. I know on the surface it seems simple enough, but I can't help wondering what's going on and if I'm actually going to hear from him at all. He hasn't said whether it's family stuff or anything (although I did stop hearing from him after his mum had asked to see him).   Men, as a socially confident and outgoing guy having been with a girl you really clicked with for a short while, would you say this if you had just randomly decided that you didn't want to see the girl any more? Or do you think this is genuinely a case of him being upset and that he'll get back in touch soon?Summary:

Summarize: Please redirect me if there is a better sub-reddit for this question. It is directed primarily at people with chiropractic knowledge.   I am seeing my Chiropractor for the third time on Thursday, to work on my right Sacroiliac Joint. She believes it is the main cause of my repeated lowerback pain. She has performed two of [these manouvres]( on me claiming she is relieving gas from the joint.   The two times she has done it i have been lying on my right side with my left leg bent. She has pushed down on my left hip and any 'cracking' appears to be felt in the left hip.   My question really is this. If i am lying in this position, and she is using this technique on me, is the technique being directed to the right or left hip? I would think that if she were trying to 'pop' or 'crack' or relieve gas for the right hip that I would be lying on my left side and she would apply the pressure to my right hip with my right leg bent at the knee.   Can anyone confirm?Summary:
Summarize: I went out with a girl with a twin sister, the one I went out with was vegetarian, not for health or ethical reasons, she just didn't like meat. Her twin sister ate a lot more normally.

Summarize: Hi reddit, I've recently decided to cut my hair short so my ears will be visible, and on them, the 12 ear piercings I have.   Now, I work in retail and it's never explicitly been said "you are not allowed piercings," and I've very often tucked my hair behind my ears. Nobody has said anything even though my piercings have been very visibly on show. I've asked colleagues and nobody knows whether it's company policy or not. Some people have nose piercings here too. Some people say it's facial piercings that we can't have, some people have said they think it's a maximum of 5 on show, some people say just one.   Should I ask what the protocol is about piercings, or just cut my hair and wait until/unless someone says something? I mean, if I'm not allowed them, I'll happily take them out for work, I'd just rather not. 12 is a faff.Summary:
Summarize: Honestly this last patch has been the most poorly thought out set of balance changes i've seen in a very long time. after all of the talk of melee being notoriously weaker then ranged in this game (except in the cases of tanks) riot starts nerfing melee assassins who are already performing at an average level in solo queue, and FAR below average in competitive..? what? not only are melee assassins weak in competitive play and are regularly bypassed for ranged mages in the VAST majority of games, but they are also average in solo queue.   lets take a look at champions "tweaked" this patch..   Fizz: a champion who's pretty much rarely/never played professionally that literally has ONLY one function (deals damage, no hard cc, no utility, not tanky) and has an average 51% ish win rate in solo queue, gets nerfed into being completely UNPLAYABLE. this is not an exaggeration. fizz is not playable right now.   Akali: a champion who is NEVER played competitively and that literally has ONLY one function (deals damage, no hard cc, no utility, not tanky) gets her range nerfed and her bread and butter burst combo outright REMOVED from the game.   Zed: arguably the STRONGEST and MOST POPULAR of all the melee assassins in the game (definitely the best competitively) and who was probably deserving of an actual nerf, ends up with the most meaningless nerf out of the 3... a minor attack speed nerf, resulting in slightly less turret killing power and slightly less dps in extended fights   Ahri: a RANGED champion who is REGULARLY and CONSISTANTLY played in competitive, who has a solid above average solo queue winrate, and the most options in terms of playing in any style she chooses (passive/safe wave clearing, roaming, dueling, aggressive, poking, etc) gets MULTIPLE buffs. presumably under the guise of "compensation for the removal of DFG", an item which PLENTY of champions can effectively use, and yet only ahri gets a "compensation" buff for it, as if the champion wasn't functional without it. we've all seen people use DFG and make it work on tons of champs. ahri, leblanc, syndra, fizz, katarina, lissandra, etc.   now, i want to make a very clear point on this entire concept of "counterplay" that riot has been obsessed with recently. this game is about DECISION MAKING and TEAM PLAY. if you get caught alone by a zed, a fizz, an akali, or another melee assassin, you SHOULD die. there shouldnt BE counterplay unless they make a mistake or your teammates save you. why? because if a melee assassin cant outduel people in 1v1s or do more damage then a ranged champion then there is literally NO advantage/reason to play a melee champion in this game unless you're a tank. ever.   as an example to point out how ridiculous the recent "balance" changes are, how does it make sense for an ahri to be able to outduel a fizz and deal similar damage in a 1v1? she has similar damage, access to hard CC, better mana costs, better AND safer wave clear, better teamfighting, a ranged auto attack for csing and harassing, better sustain, ability to siege and NEVER has to risk melee range commitment. almost every ranged mage has these advantages   Another point i want to bring up is that when people complain about assassins they have a bad habit of only thinking of games where the assassin gets fed and is running over their team. what if your teammates hadnt fed him? what if he was 0/0/0? would he still be one shotting you or 2v1ing you if you were ready for it? probably not. sure, if he catches you off guard 1v1 you'd still die or have to run, but thats the whole purpose of assassins.. 9/10 times the reason an assassin is snowballing is because you have a bad teammate who misplayed and fed him. thats how this game works. it has nothing to do with the champions involved. your teammate fed someone, so that person is stronger then he should be and he takes over the game, it happens all the time, not just with assassins. you just "feel" it more when you get caught by a fed assassin because you die quickly   anyway, im getting pretty tired of all of these balance changes that have been happening under the guise of "counterplay", because the majority of them dont seem to have anything to do with counterplay. it just seems to be trying to appease bad solo queue players who never group in this TEAM game and constantly get caught out alone, then blame the champions involved instead of their bad decision to be alone at the 25 min mark.   also, random side note, build paths for melee damage dealers SUCK. they are almost always less efficient then the typical morello/raba/void combo that ranged mages use, or the paths ADCs use. its annoying how streamlined tank/adc/mage build paths are, while melee carry build paths are sloppy and scatteredSummary:
Summarize: Honestly this last patch was the most misconceived set of balance changes that I saw in a very long time. after all the discussion of melee being notoriously weaker then placed in this game (except in cases of tanks) riot nerve melee assassins who are already at a medium level in line solo, and FAR below the average in competition.. what? not only melee assassins weak in the competitive game and are regularly bypassed for the various wise in the majority of games, but they are also average in line solo. allows to throw a look at the champions "tweaked" this patch.. Fizz: a champion who is quite rarely/never played professionally that has literally only one function (damage, not cc hard, no utility, not tanky) and has a way to win without solo game does not win much in queue, has never been completely INPLAYABLE.
Summarize: Honestly this last patch is the poorly thought out series of balance changes that I have seen in a very long time., after all the speech by Melee notoriously weaker then lined up in this game (except in the cases of tanks) trouble begins nerfing Melee assassins, who are already at an average level in solo queue, and FAR below average in the competition.? what? not only are Melee assassins weak in the competition game and are regularly bypassed for Range Mages in the VAST majority of games, but they are also average in solo queue. lets a look at Champions "tweaked" this patch.. Fizz: a champion who is quite rare/never professionally played, who literally has a function (deas damage, no hard cc, no utility program, not tanky) and has an average 51% ish-win set in solo queue, gets nerfed in its completely unreachable.
In short: Honestly this last patch has been the most poorly thought out set of balance changes that I have seen in a long time. after all the melee talk being notoriously weaker that spread in this game (except in case of tanks) mutiny begins to nerfing melee killers who are already acting on a medium level in the single tail, and FAR a "tweaked" this patch. What?

Akali: a champion who is less competitive and who has no more than one genealogy advantage, has no more than one genealogy advantage and has no more than one advantage.
Summarize: Okay, so not a whole lot has changed in the new design of the subreddit (besides a few tweaks and bugfixes), but after setting up the new [diamondclub] flair, and also seeing this old and busted design on the show (multiple times) I've realized how badly we need the new design.   So. I'm going to open the design up to testing now, even though all the styling isn't complete. I'm more worried about the more ambitious things working well (like the header), minor style tweaks/improvements can happen after it goes live. Stylistically it's already much better than the current design so I'm comfortable with doing that.   Check it out at /r/diamondclubtheme. Feel free I guess to submit stuff there for testing. Let me know if you find any bugs and annoyances in this post so I can fix them or at least respond to them. If all goes relatively well, we can switch over as soon as possible.   If you guys prefer, I could also just move it over, and we could live bugtest, it might give me more incentive to get off my ass and finish the thing, but there's potential of some things being broken.

This was my first IT job, and I came here from a paper warehouse that I worked at for four years.  I did data entry, drove a forklift, and picked orders as well.  Absolutely nothing to do with IT.   My boss's boss wrote me a glowing letter of recommendation, which detailed how great of an employee I was--that I was reliable, consistent, and had great decision making capabilities.  He couldn't comment on my IT skills, because that wasn't what my job was.   I don't know if that letter is what did it, but I got the job.Summary:
Summarize: My boyfriend has been very distant lately, which made me stress about our relationship [7 months] and whether or not he still wants to be in it.   I confronted him about this, admittedly being a little more blunt than I could have been. He responded saying he was sorry, and that he was having a rough week due to hearing some bad news. I told him I'd back off and give him some space, and I'd be right here waiting for him when he's ready. That was the end of the conversation.   On one hand, I feel awful for being so blunt with him while under emotional distress, but, on the other hand, I wasn't to know (and I still don't; he hasn't told me anything).   While I understand that it could be a private matter that he doesn't want to discuss with me, I feel disappointed that he didn't come to me for emotional support, which meant our tensions have escalated into this uncomfortable situation.

Summarize: The 90% of climate change deniers have ties to exxon part.  If those ties include things like, riding in a car, or drinking water, then you could just as easily say that 100% of them have ties.   It doesn't ring any bells that all of the other facts have footnotes, but this one has no citations at all?  Greenpeace doesn't even use that number:   The fact of the matter is that the most vocal is working for a think tank funded by Exxon.  The next most prolific writer gets 40% of his funding from exxon, and it goes down from there.   More food for thought: >The top ten contributors to this list were responsible for 186 of the 938 papers cited.   citation:   Koch Industries spends twice as much.  The title insinuates that 9 out of 10 climate deniers are in exxon's pocket.  I don't think that means the other 94 are on Koch's payroll and really rich.Summary:

Summarize: First off wanted to thank /r/gainit for staying one of the good helpful subs out there the info and inspiration here has helped me greatly on my journey   Pics: [No Flex](          [Flex](   About me: I was the typical cross country running twig in high school probably topped out at 125lbs and first year in college stopped all running and went to 132lbs. I wanted to gain weight simply to stop being the little guy. Just like a good amount here I just assumed my “fast metabolism” was the cause and I was doomed to being the little guy everywhere I went.   Started Dec 1st 2013 132lbs   Current March 30 2014 151lbs   Diet:   Calculated my TDEE at 2700cal and in an effort to minimize fat gains I started eating 3000cal/day and saw good gains quick some decent noob gains for sure. Started to plateau however and increased to my current 3200cal/day and still gaining consistently. At the beginning it was rough trying to down that amount of food and contemplated appetite enhancers for a bit but not really fond of throwing chemicals into my body that aren’t thoroughly studied. So I just kept force-feeding and eventually my stomach has expanded and getting those calories is no problem so I would definitely suggest just keep pushing it down.   Diet changed from day to day but pretty much consisted of the following: Chicken Brown Rice Oatmeal Tuna Spaghetti Potatoes Eggs Milk Weight Gainer Shakes     -Scoop of ON Pro Complex Gainer(now named Pro Gainer)   - 2Tbsp Honey -2Tbsp Peanut Butter -1 Banana -2 Cups of Whole Milk -Cinnamon (because I like cinnamon)    MyFitPal calculated it at 1303cal I drink this usually right before I go to be because the high amount of carbohydrates make me tired anyway.   While real food is by far the best I don’t think anyone would disagree. The shakes really help with pushing past those plateaus.   Anyways to sum up since Im just beginning not really concerned about the totally macro count just hitting the calorice goal for now and seems to be working just fine for now.   Lifting Routine:  Since I knew my goal was aesthetics not necessarily lifting stats I apologize I don’t have any. I didn’t squat, deadlift or bench press I know after reading this most of yall prolly just tuned out but my spine resembles that of a question mark and these cause extreme pain to it. So I made do with other workouts and I feel I am seeing great results so far   Started off with a typical BB Split Push/Pull/Leg My week looked like this:   [Monday – Chest/Tri]( [Tuesday – Back/Bi]( Wednesday – Leg/Abs Thursday – Chest/Tri Friday – Back/Bi [Saturday – Shoulder/Leg/Abs]( Sunday – Rest   All Exercises were 4x10 just keeping it simple. This split and rep ranges has shown great results for me but considering I know my goal is aesthetics this rep range has given me significant strength gains over muscle growth. When I workout with a couple buddys that look significantly larger than me I am able to lift more weight than them so going to be running German Volume Training (GVT) starting tomorrow for 12 weeks to hopefully add some serious size definitely be updating with how it goes.   What Ive Learned:   •You should never feel hungry  •FORM > Weight  •Take beginning pictures •Count Calories •Get your protein •Whey Protein only supplement worth anything •Limit Pre workout and stimulants in general to a minimum as they    reduce appetite •    Track your workouts so you know what works for your body •    This is a slow process there is no fast track •    Fat gain will happen •    Know and trust your body sometimes that pain you feel isn’t normal and you shouldn’t push through it •     CONSISTENCY IS KEYSummary:

Friday arvo i asked her if she still wanted me to come to see her at her home 2 hours away in which she replied "yeah if you want to but if you cant im not bothered x" followed by " actually No, i dont want you to watch me play cos il play bad" so i said ok dont worry about it i wont come then.   this made me feel as that she didnt want me to come when i havent seen her in a week and a half. later that night she messaged me saying that i should of come and asking if i could come now.   not having anything to do that night i made plans with my sister and told her that i couldn't come. she then instantly got pissed of at me and got really angry with me. she then got taling about how we are different and then sent these messages:   her - 'i still think what its like to be with other guys! and that doesn't mean i dont love you but its still there. all the time in the back of my head. and i still fell the same way as i did about (another guy) at the start of our relationship! i always think about it!"   then i asked "you feel the same way about me as (another guy)?   which she replied with   "i dont know what i want! i dont want to loose you but i want to do other things!"   then i said " well you cant have both, what do you mean by other things"   then she said "Well i just want to see what its like being with some one elset to feel what its like to be single and do what i want. i dont want to loose you tho"   then i said "no but right now your saying you want to break up and how am i ment to feel when i dont want to!"   which se replied with "i dont want to break up i just, idunno... i still want to be with you but i want to be able to see what its like"   this has been stuck in my head for days and i cant help thinking about her with another guy. did she say this because we where fighting and she was  losing the argument or does she really mean it?? over the last day and a bit she hasn't been acting her self while she is messaging me eg not replying or replying very bluntly but it has got better today. is it just because shes still pissed or is she sick of this relationship where as a week ago the thought of cheating on me to her made her cry.   sorry if this doesn't make much sense but i had to ask theres so many thoughts going through my head about my girlfriend who im in love with  please help reddit!!Summary:
Sumar: so yesterday I had made plans to go to see my girlfriend who lives 2 hours away and who had been dating for 8 months. our relationship has been going very well so far. Friday Arvo asked her if she still wanted me to come to see her at her house 2 hours away where she replied "yes if you want but if I can't disturb x" followed by "actually no, I don't want you to see me play because play bad" so I said ok don't worry about this I won't come then. this made me feel like I didn't want to come to see her when I haven't seen her in a week and a half. later that night she told me that I would like to come and asked me what she told me now. I have nothing to do with my sister and I told her that I couldn't go to what I couldn't go to what I could go to.
Summarize: Zeece, here's my updated feedback based on what I was able to test:   AS7-K - This is finally a viable variant! 3LPL + AC20. The most expensive standard Atlas variant finally has some use! Still offset by sluggish torso speed and low arm mounts.  Much improved   BJ-1X - Its 3LPL firepower now makes up for its fragility. Please don't ruin its quirks, it is currently actually viable.  Improved   TDR-5S - Still a bit meh since 3LLs can be done better on a SHD-2K and the remaining hardpoints on this thing lend themselves pretty much only to LRMs, but it's better than it was with the heat.  Neutral   SHD-2K - It certainly doesn't hurt to be able to fire all three LL together with less heat.  Improved   TDR-9SE - 3LPLs without ghost heat make this under-used variant much more viable but XL engine still an achilles heel.  Improved   AS7-RS, STK-4N, STK-5S: These all work best with paired LL/ERLL/LPL weapons due to their mount locations, so they are not terribly impacted one way or the other. No negative impact, maybe a slightly positive one for those with 5 weapon group buttons that can set up the Stalkers with 3/3 as well as 2/2/2 weapon groups. Atlas-RS  Neutral  but Stalkers  Slightly improved   BNC-3E with 3AC5, 3LL, 1ML. It's hot but it can work. Hitscan and ballstic weapons don't sync very well but it is still a very potent build.  Slightly improved   BNC-3M with 6LPL. Very hot. Extreme patience required but can surgically strike once every minute or so. Dead very quickly if it gets swarmed by multiple enemies.  Neutral   WVR-6K with 3LPL. Would be fantastic if it wasn't getting its LPL quirks swapped over to LL boosts on Tuesday.  Neutral  as-is,  Improved  if it retains its LPL quirks.Summary:
Summarize: All SNC buttons are well suited for all SNC buttons, here is my updated feedback when I could test: AS7-K - This is finally a viable variant! 3LPL + AC20. The most expensive standard Atlas variant has finally some use! Still balanced by sluggish torso speed and low arm mounts. Much improved BJ-1X - Its 3LL firepower now makes for its fragility. Please do not ruin its quirks, it is actually viable at the moment. Improved TDR-5S - It certainly does not hurt to fire all three LL together with less heat. Improved TDR-9SE - 3LPL without ghost heat make this variant much better than with the heat. Neutral SHD-2K - It does not hurt to fire all three LL with less heat.
Summarize: Now before i make this thread, yes i am a Yasuo main but i have thought well on these ideas to not sound bias and too be as fair as possible.   Now as you know Yasuo has been nerfed constantly over the patches and with good reason. He was an immense lane bully that scaled phenomenally well into late game and with how long his shield lasted ( 2 seconds ) and how much it shielded for ( like 640 ) you can see he was a bit of a problem. I will state my proposed changed going from Passive, Q, W, E, R.   Passive .Talking about Yasuo's passive. Yasuo was indirectly and directly nerfed with the IE change removing 10% of his crit chance and the size/length of his shield. The IE change is not an extreme loss of power but it did hurt him and Yasuo still has yet to receive compensation ( along with other melee IE users like Tryndamere ).   My first proposed change is to  Change Infinity Edge to 20% crit for ranged and 25% for melee . This change will help him bring back to where he was before in terms of 90% crit chance and help with other IE melee users as well. The second change is to  Increase his shield length back to 1.5 seconds . This will make him a tad more tanky and be able to trade for a longer period of time due to his HP nerfs.   Q.  I don't really have much to say about his Q other than to revert the windup changes from 4.13.   Minimum cast time Reverted to .13 seconds from .18 . This change will not make him instantly strong but will make it a bit easier late game to how fast he can get his Q off.   W  Now this is where i think Riot can make alot of changes.  First proposal  Bring back Yasuo's flow recharge whenever he dashes but make the amount smaller. So instead of  3%, 6%, 9%, 12%, and 15% of old patch yasuo , make the amount like  2%, 4%, 6%, 8%, and 10% . This will bring back some power to his mid-late game by being able to charge his flow faster on minions but wont make a giant difference in the laning phase and is weaker than before. Now This is a change that is all theory and i have no idea how it would work in the game.  Second Proposed  change is basically make his Windwall involve more skill to use. How would you do it you ask?  Make his Windwall last 0.5-1 second but lower the cooldown drastically . This change will promote good Yasuo's by blocking important skill shots ( Sejuani R, Jinx R, Brand R and more ) while also giving the opponent more chances to capitalize on a missed or failed Windwall than currently waiting 4 seconds for it too wear out and by the time its gone they probably have already disengaged or taken that objective. I can see some people not liking this change because lets say at rank 5 his Windwall is on a 5 second cooldown and it would be annoying to have all your skillshots blocked because his Windwalls cooldown is lower than your main damage/skillshot ability. This change is highly theoretical but i think it can be something that is tested.   E  Currently his E only stacks 2 times to give him 50% more damage when before he could stack it 4 times to give him 100% more damage. My change is to  make his E be able to stack 4 times like before but lower his base damages . By this change it allows Yasuo to be a bit weaker than current patch early on with only 1-2 levels on his E, but as you level it up more it becomes stronger than the current patch but weaker than before. For some number ideas lets make his new E  30, 60, 80, 100, 120 damage per level.  Yasuo still retains the mobility but loses alot of damage early but as you level your E and stack it to 4 times ( 100% extra base damage ) you can be sure you will bully out your opponent.   R  I don't really have anything to ask Riot to change as i think his ultimate is in a fine spot.   Again, these changes are all just ideas and can be fine tuned to maybe make it into a patch. Let me know what you guys think of these changes!Summary:
So, before I make this thread, yes I'm a main Yasuo but I thought about these ideas not to sound biased and too fair as possible. Now that you know that Yasuo was constantly nerved on the patches and with a good reason. It was a huge lane bully that made phenomenally in the late phase and with how long its shield lasted (2 seconds) and how much it was protected (like 640) you can see that it was a bit of a problem. I'll say my proposed change goes from Passive, Q, W, E, R. Passive.
This function should not be modified more than 100%....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sum: Now before making this thread, I am a main Yasuo but I have thought well of these ideas to not sound biased and also be as fair as possible. Now as you know Yasuo has been constantly nervous about the patches and with good reason. He was a huge bully lane that climbed phenomenally well in a late game and with how long his shield lasted (2 seconds) and how much they shielded for (like 640) you can see that he was a bit of a problem. I will say my proposed change of Passive, Q, W, E, R. Passive. Speaking of Yasuo’s energy loss is passive. Yasuo was indirectly and directly nerfeed with the change of his time easier.
Summarize: I asked because I tried this a couple of times and it didn't work out so well, but I hope it will work out better for you than it did for me.   Basically all the teams I've been part of that had more than 2 people in them collapsed after a couple of weeks, people just bailed out.   What I've seen that actually  works  is making a lot of games by yourself, some of which will be a bit better than others and eventually you'll produce a couple that are pretty decent and will attract people who would want to cooperate with you.   I did that, and to be perfectly honest most of my (and anyone who is starting out) games are not that interesting.  But I've managed to get a couple of small ones to the "decent enough" level where I got a bit of coverage and traffic from some indie games sites (indiegames.com, gamesetwatch, jayisgames) and am now cooperating with a graphic artist on my current game.   Regardless of all of that, good luck and I hope you make it!Summary:
Summarize: Just some insight to what it's been like:   We knew each other for the first year, we became good friends. For a week she became distant and didn't talk much. She started working where I work, so we'd see one another alot. One day she came in, and she had a mad look on her face. Didn't look at me when I spoke to her and I asked if she was ok. She said she was fine, just not feeling that good.    I tried changing the subject to something we spoke about a week ago, and she barely answered. She started working on something I was working on(putting together an item to sell). I helped, and I knocked over something by mistake, and she's like "Dude, come on..". I stopped and just looked at her. She didn't look up, just stayed quiet and ignored me. I just quietly said bye and walked away. I did not speak to her until she started speaking to me again. We became cool again. She tried to get me into her Bible studies class. I'm not really all that religious but she insisted I go. So I spent a summer going with her every Thursday. She was inspired by it, and even though we didn't share the same beliefs, I admired how passionate she was in what she believed. We became better friends after that. At one point it was ruined because a few idiots made a rumor about us. She was mad at me, didn't speak to me. Then we spoke again and she just wanted some space, and I agreed. She did not want to talk about it though. Before we agreed to give one another space, she just hated the idea of talking it out. She pointed it out to another friend that if there's something she's mad about, she does not like to talk about it. She'd rather read her bible and pray. She came back around and for over a year we've been great. She was more of my wing-woman. I did like her but the fact that I'm not as religious as her makes me feel like it cant work out. She was also always there to give me advice when I had problems with someone I was seeing as well.   But she's been a big inspiration to me. She use to call me out on being pessimistic. Said I need to be less negative and focus on positive things. And the fact that I could be more social. So she made me wanna be a better person. I started losing weight and being more outgoing. This was at a time when she was with someone. But she would message me sometimes to see how I was doing. Eventually she broke up and we would go out and eat sometimes and I'd help her with homework and sometimes take her home. I'd always make time to help her if needed. Either to cover her, or even let her borrow my car when her's was broken down. She'd bring me food sometimes, or a coffee. I'd do the same for her. At one point I was away and she asked if I was at work. Told her no, and found out she brought me food. Felt bad, but also felt happy that she thought to do that. For her Birthday I got her a blank leather book to write in, and a card telling her she's the most inspiring person I've ever met and I'm thankful to know someone as amazing as her. She loved it and gave me a big hug. Felt like our friendship was stronger than ever.   The situation:   As of recent, last week, everything was good. We talked about helping her finish a t-shirt design for a fundraiser and I made time to help her out. She didn't call me on Tuesday. So in the morning when I saw her, she was happy to see me. So I asked what happened the day before. She told me she went running. I said "oh ok, that's cool, hey next time let me know and I'll run with you". She said "no it's ok". I asked "Why not?" She replied "Because.. I kind-of don't wanna run with you" I said "oh ok" It made things awkward. And recently she flaked out on a few things we planned. And I asked her why she kept flaking out last minute. Said to her "why is it when we plan something, you back out thr last minute like "nah Im good."" She interrupted me by replying "You want me to start saying no from now on?". I realized it upset her. Wasn't suppose to be that serious. She walked away, I walked up to her, and she said she did not want to talk about it anymore, because she would get annoyed. I took a deep breath and decided to change the subject. She was reading notes and made jokes with me from some things she was reading. So for the rest of the day, things were good again.. Somewhat. I felt bad for what I said to her, so I felt some shame as to how awkward I made things. Also a customer went off on me because he felt the price of his purchase was too high so he started insulting me. I felt upset. I told her and she reassured me to just let it go. She made a joke to bring the mood up. Later she left. I spent the whole weekend in Vegas. Still feeling bad over the situation. I wanted to see her so i can apologize for it. Saw her on Friday. She looked mad. I asked if she was ok. She told me because of what I did, the friendship cant be the same. I was puzzled and asked what happened. She did not answer. I told her that whatever I did, if it's over what I said, i'm sorry for that. She didn't seem to listen.  She did agree to talk later. Next day she was working directly with me. Not a word was said. She was just quiet and in a bad mood. What hurt me most was she'd joke with others but it felt like she held a big grudge. I asked if we cant talk, she said "NO".   I was like "Why are acti.."   "Don't bother me!". She interrupted.   "Look I just wann cle.."   "Your bothering me!"..   I just stopped and walked away. My heart dropped and I was so confused. So yeah. I'm on my way out from that workplace. What hurts the most is, this is how she will remember me. And I just want her to know that whatever I did, if it's about that morning. I feel terrible.   =========================Summary:
She told me she needed a little more time. She told me she needed a little more time. She told me she needed a little more time. She told me she needed a little more time.

I tried to change the subject, about something we talked about a week ago, and she barely answered. She started to work on something I was working on, just remained calm and ignored me. I just said, ah, and went away. I didn't talk to her until she spoke to me again.

Summarize: Except the difficulty between mouse and joystick has little to do with relative precision--the just have completely different ways of controlling where you are aiming.  The mouse controls the position of your pointerd directly--if you want to move your pointer 10 units to the right, you move your mouse the equivalent of 10 units to the right.  Meanwhile, if you have a joystick, if you want to move your cursor 10 units to the right, you need to move your joystick over to the right at a position equivalent to the 10 units a second, for 1 second.  So controller users need to account for timing as well as position of joystick when moving their cursor.Summary:
Summarize: If the driver had stayed in the right hand lane, like he should have, after passing the police officer and not gone all the way over to the left hand (passing) lane without needing to pass, this probably would have never happened.  In most states it's technically illegal to drive in the passing lane without overtaking another motorist.Summary:
Summarize: I do not agree at all with that statement. In fact, that statement is so absolutely wrong I can't even believe you've played 1200 hours. Though, that's not say 1200 is by any means impressive. Someone at that amount of hours is knowledgeable, but in many ways still at an intermediate level in terms of experience.   It seems as if you're saying they can hold their own in lane, which is quite false, but it also seems that you're saying that without any consideration for other aspects of the game.   They may be able to "hold their own", but generally any professional player can take a bad match up and turn it in their favor. Compared to an average player, they're much more comfortable with the intricacies of wave pushing,  last hitting under turrets, poking, peeling, team fight prioritization, and kiting.   In fact, one of the hugest problems with an average player compared to a professional, is their inability to kite. From bronze-gold, kiting is rarely used correctly which can really hurt the capabilities of the adc to stay alive and do damage.   Minor disadvantages? Not even close. And being slightly less accurate in predicting an enemy's output? Another miss. You're highly underestimating the skill gap between an average player and a professional. It's keen insight into the output of your champion and the output of the opposing champion that allows for such clutch maneuvers and outplays, which was something I saw a lot of in worlds. As the poster above mentioned, the reason Faker is so good is because of his comfort with multiple champions and their damage output.  He makes very risky moves, but they're actually quite calculated, whereas an average player would take miscalculated risks that usually involve them wasting a summoners, or getting themselves killed by overextending.   The average LoL player doesn't understand when to gank, stay in lane, avoid wards, and place wards optimally. Whereas better players will usually go for vision wards, less coverage, but more effective coverage. Not to mention, since skillshots are so spammable in LoL, that ends up being a HUGE disadvantage when there's a clear skill gap. This is because they can be more mana efficient, poke and harass someone to zone them, and deny them experience/gold. That gold and level advantage allows them to get to 6 first, probably with a back and another item, and then drive that advantage in lane to snowball even further. Not to mention, the lane phase is so essential early on that it can really cement your position for the rest of the game.   Of course, that depends on your team fighting capabilities. Something that average players make so many mistakes in doing so. Professional players are generally far more responsive to immediate engagements, which allows them to use the cc of an engage to take a kill before its too late, or disengage quickly enough to avoid the cc if theyre on the other side of that engagement.   I realize Dota players love to be elitist about how much more skillful their game is, but please, for the love of god, stop the hyperbole. It's ignorant to spew things like "An average LoL player can hold their own against a pro", which is simply an absurd statement.   Depending on your role, this skill gap becomes even more noticeable. A fair example being the jungler, who's sole priority is to assist other lanes. Even by being a slightly better jungler, you can guarantee more smites on barons and dragons, give more presence to lanes, and be there at the right time to counter gank. Even if the only thing you were good at was smiting dragon, you could steal dragons in a losing situation and give 950g to the team, which can really help from an objective standpoint.   I could go on, and I wouldn't even be close to running out of things to say about the huge advantages skilled players bring to a game. Much of what i've said may be common knowledge, but these mechanics are very essential to the game and cannot be ignored.Summary:
Summarize: I don't agree at all with this statement. In fact, this statement is so clear when there is absolutely wrong, I can't even believe that you played 1200 hours. Although, it's not 1200 is impressive. Someone at this amount of hours is competent, but in many respects always at an intermediate level in terms of experience. It seems that you say they can keep their own line, which is pretty wrong, but it also seems that you say that without any consideration for other aspects of the game. They may be able to "hold their own", but generally any professional player can take a bad match and turn it in their favour.
The player community is not to believe that you have played 1200 hours. Although, that's not saying 1200 is definitely impressive. Someone in this amount of hours is knowledgeable, but in many ways still at a middle level in terms of experience. It seems as if you can tell them to keep track of their own, which is pretty wrong, but it also seems that you are saying that without regard to other aspects of the game. You may be able to "hold their own", but usually every professional player can take a bad match and turn it to their advantage. In fact, one of the biggest problems with an average player compared to a professional, is their inability to kite. Of bronze gold, kiting is rarely right, which can really be hurt the performance in the world community community.
In fact, that statement is so absolutely incorrect that I can’t even believe you’ve played 1200 hours. Although, that’s not saying 1200 is at least impressive. Someone in that amount of hours is knowledgeable, but in many ways still on an intermediate level in terms of experience. It seems like you’re saying you can keep your own level, which is quite false, but it also seems that you’re saying that without taking into account other aspects of the game. You can “keep your own level,” but in general any professional player can have a bad match and turn it around in your favor. Compared to an average player, you’re much more comfortable with an average player compared to a production player, while your level of wave power, last punch under turrets, poking, peeling, fighting against prioritization, and kiteing. In fact, one of the biggest issues with a professional point of view, isn’t it much easier than a player’s advantage, but it’s not much easier than the advantage.

Recently, I found out about the Film, Sound and Video course on the Ngee Ann Poly website and I got interested, but seeing that the first module was Art and Design, I started to wonder whether if this really is the right course for me as my art was very, very weak, up to the point where I can't make scenarios with stickmen.   I'm actually slow on catching up to films and TV shows and my interest in sound design and creating stories stem from video games, while I found cinematography itself interesting as I made videos randomly with a video camera out of curiosity when I was younger.Summary:

Summarize: I've [20 M] been with this girl [19 F] since the start of that last school year (early September) and it was great all the way up to summer. She told me she loves me around March or April, and has previously told me that she wanted to be sure before she said it. So wonderful. This beautiful girl is in love with me, and I'm in love with her.   Now it's the summer, and I still live on campus working and she lives at home working (half hour drive away). So we haven't got to see each other a lot, like 1 or twice a week, which was fine for me. We are both busy, at least I get to see her.   So last week she tells me she's unsure about the relationship. That she can't handle being away from me and that's she upset and such that she is just missing me the whole time. She hasn't said she wants to break up, but I'm not sure what to expect. I keep trying to tell her that it will be back to normal once the school year starts again and we can see each other more but she still seems unsure. Idk what to tell her or what to do. I really don't want to lose her.   Any advice or anything? Seriously would really appreciate.Summary:

We're both busy, at least I can see her. So last week, she tells me that she's not sure of the relationship. That she can't stand to be far from me and that she's the one who's upset and so I miss her all the time. She didn't say she wants to break up, but I'm not sure what to expect.
In summary: I [20 M] was with this girl [19 F] since the beginning of the last school year (beginning of September) and it was great until the summer. She told me she loved me around March or April, and told me before that she wanted to be sure before she said it. So wonderful. This beautiful girl is in love with me, and I'm in love with her. Now it's the summer, and I'm still living on campus and she's working at home (half an hour drive away). So we don't have to see each other much, like 1 or twice a week, that was fine for me. We're both busy, at least I see her. Last week she tells me that she's insecure about the relationship. That she can't get away from me and that's her upset and so she just misses me all the time. She didn't say she wants to leave, but I'm not sure what to expect her.
Summarize: I have [20 M] been with this girl [19 F] since the beginning of that last school year (in early September) and it was great all the way up to summer. She told me that she loves me around March or April, and she told me earlier that she wanted to be sure before saying it. So wonderful. This beautiful girl is in love with me, and I am in love with her. Now it’s summer, and I’m still living on campus working and she lives at home working (half an hour by car). So we don’t have to see each other much, like 1 or two times a week, that she was fine with me. We’re both busy, at least I see her. So last week she told me she’s not sure about the relationship. She can’t stand being away from me and she’s upset and so she’s wasting my time. She hasn’t said she wants to break or I don’t know what to expect.
Summarize: This should not be downvoted as it is true to some extent.   I worked for a small company and was twice passed over for promotion despite being not only a model employee but one who created automation which reduced my workload allowing me to take on more responsibility.   When I confronted my boss about this he basically told me it was too hard to find a replacement for me. I could easily take one a temporary workload if an equal-level person was promoted but our bottom line (and co workers weekends) would be gone for a time if I was promoted.   Luckily the agreed to develop a functional training program and gave me the lead assignment to do so. I got my promotion in 6 months and was made a part of the interview process for my partial replacement.Summary:
Summarize: Pictures of my face](   Hi, I'm a 21 yr. old male who has had acne since I was in 7th grade. Recently it’s been clearing up with some whiteheads popping up now and then, but now I’m left with a massive amount of scars. From reading the wiki/FAQ, I believe what I have is a combination of  PIH  (post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation) and  atrophic scarring . Please correct me if I’m wrong.   &nbsp;   Skin type: Very oily.   &nbsp;   Routine:  Every day, in the morning, I wash my face with Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser. Before I shower at night, I use a clean, wet face towel to gently rid my skin of dirt and oil (this really helped me get rid of whiteheads). In the shower I use St. Ives Blemish Control Apricot Scrub, then Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser. I sleep with a clean pillowcase every night.  Every three days I use  Banish's Pumpkin Enzyme Mask  for my scars. I use the medium-sized roller. After doing the [roller treatment]( I apply their vitamin C serum. I’ve been using it for around two months, but haven’t seen significant results.   &nbsp;   What can I change about my routine to see less redness and/or more smoothness in my skin? What can I do about my whiteheads? I’ve never seen a doctor/dermatologist; should I see one?   &nbsp;   Sorry for the long post, I just want to have clear skin for once in my life. I feel like I’ve tried everything and it has really worn down my self-esteem. Thank you so much for replying! :)   &nbsp;Summary:
Summarize: I've realized that a lot of Asians (both men and women) tell stereotypical Asian jokes amongst themselves. These "harmless jokes" need to be taken a bit more seriously.   An example: The other day, I was in a car with all Asian male friends, and the driver had parked his car. Aware he was a little close to the curb, he asked us if we had enough space on one side to get out. The passenger next to me jokingly (but almost automatically) blurted out "it's OK, you are Asian." No one gave a second thought about it, knowing he was joking around, but I was cringing internally. This is just one example out of the many that I have seen. FWIW, the driver of this car races cars and has a reputation in the local track scene.   Now jokes like these seem harmless on the surface, but as I analyse things a little deeper, it appears to me that Asians have simply given up in a way. As if all the stereotypes of Asians suggested by media are now an accepted truth.   Typing this up makes me feel like a sensitive little bitch, but I am not actually offended by these jokes. I mean, a joke is just light-hearted fun, I get that. However, I feel genuine concern about the status of Asians in western society, when Asians are enforcing the stereotypes themselves by telling these stereotypical jokes. It's even worse when there is a non-Asian in the group, and an Asian breaks out these jokes. I mean, when Asian people are admitting they suck at driving, then they probably DO suck at driving! This is what these jokes will convince others to believe.   I'm sure some of you here tell Asian jokes sometimes without realizing the effects of doing so. It could be the classic "It's OK, I'm Asian" (honestly heard this one enough times). But honestly guys, these jokes do nothing for us and are said by others to make fun of us. These jokes have no place amongst an Asian community...it's just plain weird. I've also noticed its the ABCs/CBCs that like telling these Asian jokes, almost as if they took on the perspective of a Caucasian and telling jokes about Asians.Summary:
I realized that many Asians (men and women) are telling stereotypical Asian jokes between them. These "safe jokes" need to be taken a little more seriously. An example: the other day I was in a car with all Asian friends, and the driver had parked his car. Knowing that he was a little bit close to the sidewalk, he asked us if we had enough space on one side to get out. The passenger next to me joked (but almost automatically) got scrambled "It's OK, you're Asian." Nobody thought about that, knowing that he was playing around, but I was snooping about it inside. It's just one example of many that I saw. FWIW, the driver of these cars and has a reputation in the local scene of the Asian song. Now, jokes like these seem harmless in fact these Asian people, but as I'm looking at them a little deeper, it seems to me that the Asians have given everything. As if all the stereotypes of As are suggested now.

Summarize: So I've been in love with this girl who I am absolutely crazy about. I really respect her and Ive been secretly in love with her for about 3 years. During these 3 years she has dated other guys and I have dated other girls, but Ive ended it with every single one of them because of her. Because of those others, I know I will never love anyone else the way I do her. So even though I know she likes this other guy right now I still told her anyway. She told me she loves me too, but now I find out she is moving away now and she says that if I can wait for 4 years till her work in another state is done, we will definitely get together. This girl is goddamn special, but I don't think I can stand seeing her date other people these 4 years and how I will remain single for so long as well?Summary:

Summarize: I have been playing TW games since the beginning and have had very few memorable challenges, but I have to say Atilla has offered some of the most difficult moments ever.  Playing as WRE or one of the smaller factions has enough challenges that has made this game interesting.   I tried playing as the Hun's and have had my butt handed to me by having multiple factions chase me across the map until my hordes were finally chipped away to nothing.   I looked up some older threads and people have remarked that this issue was supposed to have been fixed.  I am guess that is hasn't.Summary:

Summarize: Me and my boyfriend have been together for a year (long distance relationship - 450km away). We've also known eachother 3 years prior and we've been close friends. He mentioned that he had a heart problem but never told me what it was about.   These days, we started working out and I've asked him more about his heart problems. He told me he was diagnosed with ischemic cardiopathy around 5 years ago (when he was in highschool). His doctor told him to come again after 6 months, but he never went. Now, I have googled this illness so I can understand more of it, and I've seen that it's really dangerous. Now I'm very angry with him and his parents (since none of them took care of him and guided him to the doctor) - of course, I haven't told him that I'm angry.   The thing is, I don't know what to do. I'm really scared that the sickness might've gotten worse (even though he told me that he doesn't feel anything different) and I'm planning to take him to the doctor from my own money. But I'm terribly scared and worried that the life expectancy is small in this illness and that something might happen to him.   Can someone offer me advice on this problem - both with my anxiety and his illness? Thank you (and sorry for the messed up English, it's not my native language).Summary:
Let's sum up: I and my boyfriend have been together for a year (the long distance relationship - 450km). We also know each other three years before and we have been close friends.

Summarize: I'll admit the rack position, especially with a bell in each hand, is VERY uncomfortable at first since it felt very unnatural for me and it's very dependent on being able to reach your hip with your elbow(s) so things like mammary glands and excess gut-fat can get in the way. It's possible to get comfortable in the rack, but just like anything else worthwhile it takes time.   With that said, I wouldn't knock something based on appearances alone. You even say things like "looks pretty ugly to me" and claim it promotes injury and it neglects core strength so you obviously don't know what you're talking about, so let me help you out.   [Take this video of Mr.Rudnev for example]( it gives a nice side view. His elbows basing off his hips is a much more stable of a platform than the rack position hardstylers love using. The "slouch" is actually beneficial to take full advantage of his thoracic extension's range of motion. Fixating or maintaining the bells overhead is basically a weighted plank, which takes some pretty good core strength.Summary:
Summarize: No Throwaway for this. First-time poster here, fuck it.   This FU, like most, did not occur today. Let's bring this back to first grade recess in a smallish country town.   My class had just been let out for recess. Thank God. Let's go play together and have some fun. There was this group of girls I was interested in (come on, it's first grade) and I wanted to play with them. Seems like they didn't want to play with me because they kept running away anytime I'd get near them. As we all became friends later on, this was just them teasing me as we were young kids.   I wasn't having the teasing this day, not one bit. After they run away and turn to point for the last time, I climb up onto the curved ladder [shown here]( and just...drop trou.   I was only trying to moon them, my 6 year old mind though. Well, being on said ladder, as well as not having any restraint of how far down I would pull my pants, I'm showing everything. The girls are still just pointing and laughing at this point. One of the teachers watching us sees me, and immediately runs over and asks me what's going on. I try to explain my side rationally, but she wasn't having it. I get taken to the principal's office and my parents are called.   I don't remember what happened in the office, must have just been my parents. Next thing I do remember though, my aunt who was a Police Officer at the time, comes to our house to have a talk with me. She's explaining that this is a very serious matter. The school wanted to suspend/expel me or something because they said this was sexual harassment. While my aunt is explaining this, my family is just busting up as they thought this was hilarious. My aunt was juggling being stern and forward with me while yelling at my brothers and sister to STFU.Summary:
I was a friend of mine, but I was one of my parents, and I was one of my friends later, it was just those who teased me as we were young. I didn't have time to tease myself today, not a little bit.

Like most, it didn’t happen today. We’re going to take this back to the first grade in a small town in the country. My class had just gone out for recreation. Thank God. We’re going to play together and have a little fun. There was a group of girls I was interested in (come on, it’s the first grade) and I wanted to play with them. It seems they didn’t want to play with me because they ran away every time I got close to them. As we all became friends later, this was just that they were kidding me like we were young kids.

Summarize: I remember him mentioning something about taking another look at scrolls when Judgement (a draft like Hearthstone arena) arena came out in November. The problems I can think of with scrolls from playing until December(more or less stopped when I got into the Hearthstone beta) is:     The game length. I've had games go 45 minutes/an hour sometimes. Some of those are close, other are what are called "draw decks" (I don't know if they can still work because of balancing) which are decks that mainly stall and use cheap structures that give resources when they are played to block the idols from being damaged while in the mean time putting most of their deck into their hand. Annoying as hell and right before I stopped playing I would just surrender instead of wasting the next 45 minutes.     The complexity. The hex board design has a high learning curve, along with the deck building, and resource/draw management in game.     The pay model. TB has said multiple times that he is willing to spend money to catch up because he doesn't have the time to play a couple possibly half an hour average length games per day to get gold. Scrolls doesn't have a "daily" system like Hearthstone but a lot more gold is given at the end of games, the problem is that winning still gives a much larger amount compared to losing even after Mojang balanced it a little bit. Argue if "pay to win" should be in the game or not but its a reason why someone who doesn't have a lot of time would be discouraged to play the game.     If TB Plays Judgement that in itself is another huge learning curve. Judgement is a draft of 45 (I think they changed the number but its around there) scrolls and make a deck with 30 of them. Its much different than the constructed play because a deck is "cycled" through much faster. Personally I didn't like it that much because of that difference and with the 1000 gold it takes to play(I don't remember the shard cost) can be better used on something else in my opinion.     The game doesn't have that many scrolls to choose from. When I stopped playing there were roughly 45 different scrolls in each of the four factions which wasn't that much, less than the number of cards Hearthstone has if my memory is correct. There is a new update coming out soon if not already out now with new preconstructed decks which can be purchased with shards so there might be a chance for more videos come out.     The game from my point of view is not nearly as entertaining to watch as Hearthstone. Hearthstone's game boards were built from the ground up to be played on the computer with the amount of interactiveness. Hearthstone is usually quicker in terms of game length, its much more "colorful"(it has more eye candy to me than scrolls does.) Every minion in Hearthstone says something when they are played and when they attack they say something, minions that have 8 attack or more have that impact sound. I'm not trying to shit on scrolls, just state the difference in facts. The amount of resources Mojang has can't really compare to Blizzard.Summary:
Summarize: I remember something to take another look at reels when Judgement (a different game like Hearthstone arena) came out in November. The problems I can think of with reels to play until December (more or less stopped when I arrived in Hearthstone beta) is: The game is much longer. I have had games going 45 minutes/one hour sometimes. Some of them are close, others are what are called "draw game decks" (I don't know if they can still work because of balance) that are games that are mainly waiting and use inexpensive structures that give resources when they are played to block idols from being damaged while in time put most of their game in their hand.
Summarize: I think that it can take another role if another look of reels when the judgment (a design like Hearthstone Arena) Arena came in November.

Summarize: Hey guys.  So I last night in Manhattan, I was out with my friends at a soul/funk show.  The music was really good and I made it a point to not drink during.  Anyone ever feel like they go to shows and they're so bothered by all the other external stimuli that they barely listen to the music?  I decided that wouldn't happen, so I made it a point to focus on the music and have fun! Didn't look at other people to make sure that it was "ok" to have fun.  Had a blast. Show soon lets out into a bar area.   I float around for a little bit, trying to scope out.  Spot a HB8 talking to a friend.  I wasn't brave enough to deal with both of them at the same time (any tips you guys?) but luckily, the cuter one goes to do something with her purse and I approach.   Nahtanos: (using RSD Tyler's approach)  Hey! Who are you?  (By the way, this opener tends to get the, what? what fuck? reaction.  You just have to stick with it, look dead in the eyes and own it. I said this deadpan, with a flat inflection in my voice.) Tracy: Hi, um, I'm Tracy?  N:   super big smile  Hi, I'm Jonathan, cheers!  clink  (if you actually know how to smile and are happy about it, people will always smile back. My smile is so good its infectious.)  She smiles back and cheers  What did you think of the show?  Tracy: It was good! What did you think? N: It was awesome! I LOVE motown!  I start dancing in place, twirling  Hahahaha Tracy:  hahaha, who do you know in the band? N: My friend's brother is the front man. I came for moral support.  (ok so that past two exchanges were a good example of like being fun and then qualifying yourself.)  Tracy: oh cool.  N: How's your weekend? Tracy: It's ok, how's yours?  N: It's good, I was bartending today at the brunch shift. I don't know who decided it brunch was thing in Manhattan, but it's SUCH a thing. (All of this is done with lots and lots of enthusiasm.  It's not a strategy I adopted, it's just who I am.  I'm high energy, and again, it's infectious. People get wrapped up in it.) Tracy: Yeah, but it's the perfect solution for being hungover! N: haha I suppose.  If waiting in the cold for 20 mins and then paying 14 bucks for eggs is a hangover cure, I'd do it I guess. (< not afraid to disagree, to say what I think)   So we begin to talk about who comes into my restaurant.  This qualifies me again.  We talk about actors, I learn she's a producer.  We fluff and fluff. I do this thing where I say, hey you'd look good in glasses and then I hand the chick my glasses and I take a picture of her and show it to her.  It's really comforting to the girl.  We talk about fifty shades of grey and why so many women read that book.  I tell her she probably likes it when guys slap her on the ass and stuff her face in the pillow.    btw, her reaction to that is the wtf?what?wow! kind of thing, and again you just gotta own it  I just laugh at her and say wow you just got really uncomfortable.  Then I change the subject.  I tell her my dream is to become the president of the United States, and I grab her shoulders when I do this.  Slight kino.  More fluff, more slight kino, pushing her away, punching her lightly on the arm. So it's going well.  I'm making her laugh, I'm qualifying myself by showing her I have a fucking life and fucking dreams.  I'm kino-ing slightly, trying to push-pull.   Unfortunately, her friend comes back and asks if she wants a beer.  She offers to buy me one so I say yeah.  We get the beer and there's three of us at the bar and we're all bantering and stuff.  We talk about 3-D printers, etc. We talk about my becoming future President and how I'd have to appeal to "their humanity" in order to get their vote or some bullshit like that.  The friend leaves and i'm starting to get a buzz and she starts talking about politics.  Because I've just been going where the interaction takes me, I unfortunately let her go on and on about it. I mean on the one hand, it was natural, but she was floundering cause she didn't know what the fuck she was talking about.  I let it happen cause I didn't want to have a jarring shift in convo.  Anyways, my brain is starting to panic a little.  She's not having as MUCH fun as earlier and I'm wondering how i can amp the conversation a little more.  (As a progress note, this is like 10 minutes into the interaction. If her emotional level was at a 0 when I approached, she was at a 5 now, out of 10)  But I didn't know how to really amp up anymore.   More unfortuantely, her friend comes back and tells us they're gonna move on to the next bar.  I say im gonna stay with my friends, so I say; N: Have coffee with me on Monday Tracy: ehh, I work on Monday.  N: (FUCK!) Alright.  (So I kinda sulk off a little, like face the bar, and not her. She turns to her friend, fluff with her.  I'm thinking about what I could possibly say to recover. I'm not sure what to do, I wait a few seconds.)  N: When are we gonna hang out.  Tracy: Nahtanos, how old are you? N: you really wanna know? I'm 23.  Tracy: i'm 32, This is not gonna happen.  N: Oh my God!! I asked if you wanted to hang out, not fuck me!(hahahahahhaha, dunno why i said that, cause i totally wanted to fuck her) Tracy: Ok i just wanted to make sure my intention was clear. (hahaha i guess that's good, because it showed that my intent was fucking clear the whole time.  she knew wassup)   She gives me some shit about how at women, post 28 years old, something clicks and like SO much shit has already happened that they're in a completely different place in life and all this shit.  I say sure sure sure.   N: Do you have any single friends? T: I know a 19 year old at NYU. She's cute. N: Awesome, we're all gonna hang and you're gonna introduce me to her. T: cool! See yah!   SO! Lessons learned.  I dunno.  I know for SURE that:Summary:
I did something not to drink. I never felt like I was going to shows and they are so disturbed by all the other external stimuli that they barely listen to the music?

Summarize: I think we'd all see similar shades of the color, but I don't think we'd see completely different color. My red might be someone else's light red. But I doubt they'd see a blue or whatever. The reason I say that is because we make all warning signs harsh colors like red and orange. These colors say "hey, look at me!" I can't imagine people thinking an important sign that needs to be looked at colored as my perception of gray would be a good idea.Summary:
Summarize: Long time (end game) player of Runes of Magic. I quit about 2 years ago, although I log in every once in a while to check on things. The game itself is in free fall just as it was when I quit playing.   When I played I was probably in the top 10 NA as far as skill/knowledge/gear goes, so I can give you some insight. First of all, yes it's pretty much identical to WoW style. It's a traditional tab target, skill spam MMO with a typical treadmill style gear system and it's great.   But if you're just starting to think about playing it I would say this:     Like I said the game is in free fall, the publisher is horribly greedy and it shows. Meaning it's not very populated. At end game its even worse,  if you manage to play that far, the community is so small that you actually KNOW all the end game players, their class and how they're geared.  Even players from other servers. No other MMO has that small of a community and that's all thanks to the the publisher milking the players before the game dies fully.     As far as the payment system goes.. The game itself is "Free to play,  Pay to win". Meaning, if you want to ever run anything end game you'll have to spend money.... and LOTS of it. Several hundred atleast to get some decent starting gear. The situation has changed a bit since I quit because the game has major economic issues due to duping and what not so weapons end up costing 50+ mil gold. (Also lots of gold sellers in the game).     As far as PvP goes, you're basically looking at one type and that's Siege. Essentially guild vs guild for 1 hour, first guild to take down the other guilds "castle" wins. There is arenas, but not many people play it and they're not very fun. The pvp in the game is a "one shot" fest.. meaning the fighting comes down to the flavour of the month class and who has the highest tier gear. In siege its fun because you get in fights with healers and immunes and what not. In Arenas the fights are over quickly.     As far as raiding goes, the game has 6 man and 12 man instances, they're pretty fun but once again due to problems in the  game with duping and what not, instances quickly become farming sessions to get weapons to sell for 40+ mil gold.       Do I regret spending several years playing it? Absolutely not. I loved it, and its the best experience I've had with an MMO (Most of the experience is due to the small community. You become more of a family rather than just another guild to join to gear up).   Would I suggest new players to play it? Eh probably not. It's a good game, plagued with problems due to the publisher, and a developer who has ZERO communication with the publisher and the community. Meaning there are still bugs in the game which have been there since the beginning. Hell the whole Siege PvP system is still in "Beta", after several years.   If you really like what Runes of Magic has to offer, I suggest playing it on a private server. There are a few out there, and they fix some of the issues the actual Runes of Magic servers have as far as the economy goes.   Honestly I've been looking for a game to replace Runes of Magic ever since I quit, I've tried several games (Including Rift) which the user above me has mentioned. Rift is a good game, and has a much better "Free 2 play" system. In Rift you don't NEED to buy anything, where as Runes of Magic you pretty much HAVE to buy from the item shop. However the two games are very different. Rift does not replace Runes of Magic, only reason I quit Rift is because the massive amount of farming you have to do at end game. (You have to farm reputation/notoriety with these factions to get certain items which are necessary to advance) Some notoriety take months to reach the cap, and you need to reach the cap in order to get the necessary items.Summary:
The game itself is in free fall as it was when I stopped playing. When I played I was probably in the top 10 NA as long as the skill / knowledge / game will, so I can give you a bit of insight. First of all, yes, it's pretty much identical to the WoW style. It's a traditional tab target, spam MMO skill with a typical treadmill style system and it's great. But if you just start thinking about playing, I would say this: As I said, the game is in the fall free, the publisher is awfully greedy and it shows. Which means that the game is not very populous.
In pmarize: long time (final game) player of Runes of Magic. I did about 2 years ago, although I go in any time to check things out. The game itself is in free fall as it was when I stopped. When I played, I was probably in the top 10 NA as far as skill/knowledge/equipment goes, so I can give you some insights. First, yes, it's pretty identical to WoW style. It's a traditional tab goal, skill spam MMO with a typical treadmill style gear system and it's great. But if you manage to play that far, the community is so small that you actually KNOW all the end game players, their class and how they are aligned. Even players from other servers. No other guild has that the small of a game to play that most players want to play the game because the whole milk game.
Summarize: My boyfriend's best friend was diagnosed in April and began immunotherapy, but we recently found out that it wasn't working.  When my boyfriend was telling me this, I could tell he was devastated.  My boyfriend isn't a negative person, more of a realist, but he's convinced that chemotherapy isn't going to work and it's going to take a miracle for his friend to beat this. After he told me the news he was silent for a moment, then quickly changed the subject to something else and we haven't really talked much about it since, aside from him telling me he talked to his friend or he hung out with his friend.  No details on if his friend has decided to do chemo or not.   I understand people deal with things like this in their own way.  I know when I'm dealing with something heavy I tend to internalize before I'm ready to talk.  I don't want to push him to talk about it if he's not ready, but I know he can't bottle this up.  How do I let him know it's ok to talk to me with out him feeling like I'm pressuring him?Summary:

Summarize: Hello r/truegaming! I am a high school student that attends an IB school, and thus have to write an Extended Essay (a 4000 essay on any topic that the student chooses to write about). I thought I would choose a topic that would interest me, and thus decided to write the essay on something related to games. After a bit of discussion with my supervising teacher, he suggested the topic of "The Usage of Games as a Form of Literature", and something along those lines. Therefore, I would like to ask you, veterans of gaming, what you think about this topic, and if you know of any, some researches regarding this topic. As appealing as this topic was to me, and also plausible (one example that my supervising teacher mentioned being Final Fantasy X, which I agreed after his explanation) I failed to find a good number of papers regarding this topic.Summary:

Summarize: I recently bought into Jet Blue, not only because I am a long term customer of the airline, but because i see growth potential for the company, and more importantly, the stock. Here are the reasons, and feel free to add anything you feel necessary. My background is a biology major who analyzes the stock market for fun in my ROTH IRA. So all of my stocks are bought with the idea that I will hold for at least 1-2 years, although a quick spike in a company can lead me to take my profit and run. I have only lost money in 1 stock (bought 10), and I am looking to get better at analysis.   Why I bought JBLU   I bought shares on 5/21, the day after the airline industry fell on the fear that lower fares would result from competition. I specifically selected JBLU because the average P/E of the airline industry hovers around 16.3, and JBLU was at 13 when I bought in. This alone showed me that there was room for upside in a company that I believe has growth potential, and therefore should be valued above 16 P/E   Why this company will grow?   JBLUE is expanding into the carribean and mexico. This offers increased coverage of its planes, and heading into the summer months where many people travel, an increase in flights to warm weather destinations could result in higher sales for JBLU. JBLU has also relied on the large airports to use as its base terminals, and not expand into the smaller airports. While this reduces its potential sales numbers, it both helps JBLU maintain the look of a premium airline (which can charge higher rates but still remain low-cost), and it offers it opportunity for growth in the event its current strategy is not producing the desired results.   Oil:   This is a two-headed dragon. Oil prices are low right now, saving airline companies billions in fuel, which has not resulted in a decrease in prices yet. Some analysts believe that this is already priced into the stocks, but an extended period of oil below $60 per barrel will save the airlines a lot more money, and that looks to be exactly where we are headed.   Most recent quarter:   JBLU's most recent earning were very good. They were able to decrease there expenses by 3%, with most of that coming from a decrease in fuel prices by 34%. If this continues, expect their to be even further savings in the second quarter. In addition, there was an almost 10% increase in flyers seen in the quarter, which shows that JBLU is increasing its customer base at a great rate, and it makes sense to think that it can increase its customer base even more through adding more destinations. Its revenue was also up 12.6% y/y, which helped reduce its P/E from the 16.38 that was seen before earnings, to its current level of 13, which suggests that it should be increasing in the coming months to match that P/E.   Customers:   The customers at JBLU are considered "loyal," which means that typically these customers are returning. I for one return as a customer because of the in flight entertainment, which is unlike any airline I have encountered. Being able to select your own TV station or radio station enhances the flying experience dramatically, resulting in an increasingly loyal user base. In one study ( JBLU ranked highest in customer satisfaction, and as the article states, "JetBlue Airways ranks highest in the low-cost carrier segment for a 10th consecutive year, with a score of 801. This also marks the 11th consecutive year JetBlue has ranked highest in the study.[2] JetBlue improves in all seven factors year over year, most notably in reservation (+29) and boarding/deplaning/baggage (+22)." This customer satisfaction means that a JBLU customer is unlikely to turn away from the airline, suggesting that the user base will continue to grow.   Price targets:   I rely on analysts for price targets because I do not claim to be an expert. I would love to see some input on how to calculate a good price target. I mostly use the P/E and overall company view and direction when picking a stock, and it has worked well so far. That being said, the analysts are also high on JBLU. Through my ROTH IRA, the stock analysis is rated "very bullish" with no analyst rating the stock "underperform" or "sell." One site I found had this to say: "The 12 analysts offering 12 month price targets for JetBlue Airways Corporation have a median target of 24.50, with a high estimate of 28.00 and a low estimate of 19.00." The "high" represents approximately a 40% gain, the median a 21% increase, and the low is only a 6% drop from where it closed today. These price targets are corroborated by other sites, and the consensus is a PT of approximately $25 per share. This may continue to be upgraded depending on how the ticket prices and oil price plays out over the summer months, but JBLU is primed to make a run over the summer monthsSummary:

Summarize: I have forgotten what the original topic was.  But I still remember the time a squirrel didn't make it out of my way.  I ain't swervin' for no varmint.  I hear the thump, and in my rear view I see him dragging the lifeless back half of his body around with his front legs.  Didn't have the heart (or really the consideration) to back up and finish the job.   Somewhere, a superstrong squirrel is impressing lady squirrels with his remarkable handstand antics.  Then he gets them back to the nest, where they discover the accident left him powerless "down there."  They make fun of him and leave.  He falls off the branch and has to be helped back up by his loyal but nut-brained squirrel friend.  At least that's how I saw it playing out as I drove away.Summary:
Summarize: I've been depressed my entire life, and I'm currently in a very shit spot where everything is joyless and I don't give a fuck about anything. I wrote a longer post about things here:   Normally I stay awake half the night with anxiety and other thoughts/worries, but now I haven't slept at all for two days. This is the second day I've taken off work without calling in, and I'm trying to get myself back to the point of going in and facing the music. I don't care if I get canned or not, but I realize that doing so would be bad for me and the people I work with (primarily my dad).   I've been coping by using alcohol for years, and I'm seriously concerned it's going to kill me. Since the beginning of the year I've been getting drunk almost every night and it's butchering my bank account. However, it's the only thing (other than drugs) that lets me feel other emotions and gives me a way to not give a fuck about everything I'm procrastinating on. It lets me feel numb about how I'm letting myself and everyone else down.   I need other alternatives. I've seen a counselor but talking hasn't really helped, and the last antidepressant I was on was Effexor which did nothing, even though the side/withdrawal effects were totally fucked.   I can identify self-defeating or self-destructive behaviour, but I having serious problems stopping or preventing it. I don't want to die. What else can I do?Summary:
Summarize: throwaway and rant to get something offmychest   I've had a fling with a girl for the past semester, lets call K. K and I have been in a similar friend group (which involves several of the people I live with) for about 2 years now.The fling started early this past semester.   It was never anything serious, maybe once or twice a month when she was over at my house partying she'd come back to my room and we'd fuck a few times. We'd hang out occasionally outside of that as well.   The last time we hooked up was a month ago before finals and before I started studying for a big exam for a few weeks. K and I still hung out and chatted occasionally during this time. I went home for a week and she texted me a lot a lot while I was gone making it seem like she wanted to hook up again.   I finally get back to campus and shes partying at my house and it seems like things are going well and we'll hook up that night. Eventually K decides to leave to go to another house for a bit and I opt to go with some of my friends somewhere else. We make out before we parting ways and she's texting me a lot while we're a part offering to come back to my house because I was kind upset about something else at the time.   Fast forward to me coming home and asking if she'd like to meet up. I learn that K is too drunk at the house she was at and I didn't want to deal with that so I go to bed. Well turns out after going to bed she fucked one of the guys at the house she was at (also a mutual friend). She doesn't know that I know this. I learned from one of her online blogs that I found by accident and check from time to time (terrible idea btw).   While my time with K was very lustful, she's beautiful, has a kick ass body, and we have excellent physical chemistry. Yet, I didn't agree with a lot of her life choices and she was difficult at times to deal with.   What upsets me most is that while I was away from campus she was texting me things about wishing I was back on campus and wanted to know when I'd get back and what I was doing. I was excited to get back to her and continue our fling. I guess I got led on and let my hopes get up for nothing. It was also upsetting how before we parted ways that night she acted really into me, lots of touching and the make out before she left. Then she turned around and has sex with someone else.   I know I can't blame her because we were never dating. These kind of flings always end with someone getting hurt and I guess this time it was me. The way she described it on her blog didn't even sound remorseful or worried that I'd find out. It just sounded factual and content with what happened. I want to confront her about it somehow even though I know its is a bad idea. I get more upset by the thought of her thinking I still don't know and that everything is fine. The next time she wants to try and sleep over at my house, I know that if I say no and wont let her she'll just go off and fuck this guy again which also sucks to think about. I know I have no choice though and we can't hook up again.   Thank you for reading, if you have any input feel free to shareSummary:

Summarize: Hello there,   A strawpoll recently arrived on this Reddit about what was the best TGT card revealed yet. The result was crual : Coliseum manager is the less appreciated card of the mix... But I want to give this card some love, imagining the scenario where it would be the BEST card you could ever want.   To know when it's good, we have to understand more precisely the strength of this card. Most of people see him as a 2-5 for 3 that you can replay for 5 mana with the only value of healing him + a hero power. So it seems like replaying a minion in Hearthstone doesn't have more advantage than healing it, and that fact is due to the extreme rarity of debuffs in the game : The only true debuff available for players is corruption, a slow hard removal that isn't played anymore. We can eventualy consider cards like power overwhelming or Nightmare as debuff after a buff, but you would rather use these on a deathrattle creature than saving your guy.   The only punishing debuffs that we ever saw was in Blackrock mountain adventure mode, where a boss could cast "Living bomb" on a creature : If the creature was alive at the end of the turn, you would get punished by dealing 5 damages to all friendly characters. That is the kind of mechanic that coliseum manager can counter, but we don't see these every day.   Moreover, for the mana cost of this guy to be viable, you would need the debuff to be extremely punishing, something that would make you loose the game on its own if not managed. So it would need to be some strong boss...   Now let's imagine you're facing the Lich King himself ! As a final boss, he has an OP hero power on his first phase : "Necrotic plague" killing a minion at the end of your turn, and summoning a 5-5 shambling horror for the lich king. Moreover, you would have to deal with the 4-2 Drudge ghouls that are played by the boss. With regular cards, you would struggle, wasting tons of spells to survive.. But if you had the Coliseum manager in THAT context, you could save time and gain a card advantage to survive the next phase.   This is what agent tournament was about in WoW : finding heroes that could be strong enough not to die and feeding value to the Lich King. And THIS GUY, coliseum manager, decides to have his whole life prepared to counter him, even if people will tell he sucks. Respect him, he has a life purpose, not like this "argent watchman" dude who does nothing if you don't give him any order.Summary:
The result was crual: The coliseum manager is the least appreciated card in the mix... But I want to give this card a little love, imagining the scenario where it would be the best card you might want. To know when it is good, we need to understand more precisely the strength of this card. Most people see it as a 2-5 for 3 that you can play again for 5 mana with the only value of curing it + a hero power. So it seems like playing again a minion in Hearthstone has no advantage but to cure it, and that fact is due to the extreme rarity of debuffs in the game: The only real debuff available for players is corruption, a slow hard removal that is no longer played. We may eventually consider cards as overwhelming or peeling your friend the advantage that you could put in the game.
Summarize: wall of text   First timer here. :)   I live with my family, so naturally, I am the go-to for IT stuff.   Now, my mum and my brother are computer literate. They have their own desktops/laptops at home. Dad on the other hand, was the more stubborn kind.   I have a fileserver at home, which has Win 7 and multiple log-in patch. I don't know about running virtual desktops so thats why i went this route. Everyone at home as an account, so they can remote into it so they can access their bigger files on the go, or when they are at someone elses house and want access via someone else's PC.   This fileserver is attached to the TV in the lounge, so that people logged into the MEDIA account can watch movies and such.The MEDIA account is heavily restricted. Only shortcuts to exist on the desktop to the movie/tv ep folder, and Chrome can only access certain websites (i have one of those pc's with firewall/web monitoring, cannot remember the name as I installed it yonks ago now. smoothwall or something?)   Backstory about dad. Dad has had his own desktop/laptop in the past. He actually has a new ASUS laptop when he went on his oveseas trip couple of months ago. The problem is, he is one of those people who cannot contain himself when it involes Pron, and every single ad is a temptation to click. So does his emails. Newly formatted/installed windows will start freezing in a couple of weeks, and there are a bajillion of toolbars. I have actually restricted his own account on his laptop due to this.   Cue Sunday night. He doesn't have work for this day (he is roster-based). So he goes to watch as per usual. He decided to browse facebook and the normal sites available. He then suddenly forgets that he is restricted, and starts raging on why he cannot do this/do that.   First stop, my door.   dad: Oi! Why can't I download this file off my email?   me: because you can't. I've restricted your account.   dad: what the fuck. I should be able to. Its my account after all!   me: no, its the MEDIA account. Its restricted. I don't want viruses or malware on it.   dad: no, it is my account. I use it all the time. I should be allowed to do whatever I please.   me: you know, I will just unrestrict your laptop. BUT do not come back to me for help with fixing it.   dad: whatever. just go do it.   So I do. Gave him user access (without admin rights, just to keep it in check). He's happy, for a few days.   dad: How do I edit the registry? I was reading something online, and that I could download stuff free if I edit the registry.   me: You can't. If you do that without know what you are doing, you could risk doing something bad   dad: what's so bad about free downloads. You do it on your fileserver.   me: at least i know how to get them without getting a virus or some malware crap.   dad: just do it, will ya.   So i decided to not give a damn anymore after that amount of whinging from him. Mum heard this, and had a big smirk on her face, as she knows where this will lead to.   I remove all restrictions, and told him that he can do it himself and show him how to run regedit.   NOT 5 MINUTES!   dad: errrr something is wrong. I'm now getting popups and this is saying that I have a virus and i need to download it.   me: registry shouldn't do that. what did you do?   dad: well since you took off the restriction, I decided to download that file off my email which you so hated. It had an awesome powerpoint jokes from my friend. But then it started doing this.   me: did it tell you to install something? (just wanting to confirm)   dad: that was the only way to get the powerpoint thingee out and onto my desktop.   /facepalm   me: go away. I told you I won't fix it if something went wrong.   dad: why do you have to be so selfish. Just fix it.   Then this happened   mum: because you idiotic fuck was told what would happen if you did this kind of crap. You were restricted for a reason from the last time your son had to put a new operating system in it.   my bro and I poke our heads out our door and see dad, head down, walk away and sit down, defeated. He goes to watch a tv ep afterwards. My mum had this smirk again, and told me to fix it, and this time, not to remove the restrictions and tell him to speak to her regarding it.Summary:
Summarize: My boyfriend is a great person. Even though there is an age difference between us, we always get along and respect each other. Nothing is going horribly wrong, so I don't really understand my strong desire to leave him. It's really not about me wanting to see other people or experiment, I just suddenly don't want to be in this relationship. I feel horrible for feeling this way as I love him and I feel like I wasted his time. I can't bring myself to break up with him because I'm so attached to what we have, but at the same time things just do not feel right. All of a sudden I'm starting to find little things he does annoying and as a result I'm so irritable with him. I don't like being so mean for no good reason. He's really attached to me and always talks about how we'll go through anything together - so I hate how I'm suddenly not on the same page.   How do you know when it's time to really walk away? I don't want to do something I'll regret later, but this does not feel healthy.Summary:

Summarize: Hello Baltimore Redditors,   (yes YET another show promotion, but this one is good, quirky fun that probably isn't on your radar already and is worth your time, I promise!)   My comedian and sex educator friends host a monthly show called 4-Play, featuring two regular hosts (an improvisor with the Baltimore Improv Group, and the owner of a local sex toy shop in Hampden), and featured guests. In honor of Pride month (which, in pretty much everywhere aside from Baltimore, typically takes place in June), this show's topic is Coming Out.   The show runs about two hours and typically features a lot of funny banter about things like butt stuff and hookups, interspersed with actually useful educational advice, personal storytellers, comedy, skits, and an audience Q&A session.   The guests this month are Ti Coleman, another ridiculously funny improvisor with the Baltimore Improv Group; and Dr. Jodi Kelber-Kaye, associate director of the honors college at UMBC, who (among other kinda super important things) was instrumental in the fight for marriage equality in Maryland.   I'd love for more people to check out this show - it's great and informative and mindblowingly funny at times - but our ticket sales haven't been quite as strong as this show deserves. Check out recordings of past shows on iTunes if you're curious:Summary:

I get incredibly nervous and basically I don't know what to say. Any advice on what I can do to keep my cool and break the ice?Summary:

Summarize: OK so this might be a bit nit picky but please let me explain why Braum's W should be different  before he comes out   His current W is   Braum leaps to the aid of a nearby ally, positioning himself between his target and their nearest enemy champion, and granting both Braum and his target bonus armor and magic resist based on his total armor and magic resist.   This is all great I love the concept. However I just don't feel like a leap is what a man with a massive shield should be doing. Here's what I propose instead.   Braum runs (with thunderous footsteps) to the aid of a nearby ally, knocking aside all enemy champions in his path, and granting Braum bonus armor and magic resist based on his total health. Upon reaching his ally he will swing his shield knocking any nearby enemies back.   I'm not sure why but I just feel that this is what his W should be. It's just more him, it allows for interruptions and counter play to his defense while offering more cc for him. Maybe it's op but it doesn't deal damage and just provides your adc with a better chance to escape. Let me know what you guys think.Summary:
Summarize: Hello r/weddingplanning! I have had a crazy week and I felt like I needed to share to both vent and rave. Prepare for a huuuuge wall of text!   Due to a family member's health my fiance and I decided to alter our wedding plans. Instead of having a 200+ person wedding in the summer of 2017 we are having a 38 person wedding this summer - July 30th to be exact! I have a huge family and so we made the tough decision to invite only siblings, parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, and our closest friends. We have some cousins who are upset with us because of this but we are going to be having a celebration at my family's lake property a couple of weeks after the wedding where they and the rest of our families will be invited. I feel as though once we send out the invite for that they will feel more included and won't be as upset (I hope!).   Due to the fact that we made this decision last week I have been running around like a chicken with my head cut off! We decided to keep the budget small at $5000 because we are also purchasing our first home this year (today we just found out we are approved for much more than we need! Yay!). I luckily had my wedding dress already purchased and I was able to get appointments with the seamstress to do all of the alterations starting at the end of the month, she said she would most likely be completely done May 14th!   The first thing I booked was the most important to me - our photographer! I had just done a boudoir session with her for my fiance's birthday and we got along super well. The night before we decided to change our date I had actually gotten a hold of her to book for 2017. When I sent off the email I had the realization that she was the only thing I had been looking forward to booking for the wedding and that I was dreading the planning of the huge event that our wedding was going to be. The next day we decided to change our date and I emailed her back asking if she was available any day in either July or August. I was fully prepared to plan our wedding around whichever date she was available. She got back to me right away and had the exact date that I wanted to get married available! To me it was a huge sign that we were doing the right thing and it was meant to be this way.   My bridesmaids and I have decided to make a trip to Edmonton in May for their dresses and because of the time constraints we decided as a group that they will be wearing different dresses but in our wedding color (lavender). I also managed to book our hair and makeup at one of the nicer salons in our town. The only thing that sucks about the salon is they do not discount for trials so I will have to pay full price for my hair and makeup trial :( My fiance and his groomsmen will be wearing dress pants and vests so it will be easy for them to get their attire arranged!   I had already purchased all of the silk flowers to make our bouquets and boutonnieres at Michaels during a crazy sale and I got them all for $157!! I was going to have fresh flowers and had my heart set on hydrangeas but I was told by a florist that they wilt really quickly and that I would be disappointed so I'm going to be creating my own using the silks! I'll be posting photos once I have them all arranged!   We decided on using one of our city's public parks for our ceremony due to the fact that they are extremely reasonable to book ($23/hour) and really well maintained. Unfortunately, the site that I originally wanted was already booked so we had to change our plans and use the other side of the park. Even though it wasn't what I originally wanted I am actually loving our new ceremony site. The original site was a large garden with a stone staircase for us to walk down and our new site is in the trees so I will be walking 'down the aisle' among a little mini (well kept) forest which I think is really romantic. Also, because it is in the trees there will be shade if it's sunny and coverage from rain if the weather doesn't cooperate. I also booked our marriage commissioner for the ceremony which will be a short 20 minute civil ceremony.   We are having our dinner at a small local restaurant which has a beautiful banquet room. The food is to die for! I've actually gone and had the meal we will be serving at our dinner twice in the last week haha! We will be having a buffet with a variety of salads, vegetables, a tapas platter, dinner buns, slow roasted prime rib, herb mashed potatoes, and assorted dessert squares.   I was stressing about what to do about the cake because we had already hit our budget limit when one of my co-workers who I'm close with texted me and offered to make my wedding cake as her gift to my fiance and I! It turns out that she has made quite a few wedding cakes for her family members and from a little facebook snooping is really good at it! We're going to be getting together soon to look over ideas and come up with a cake design.   Everyone has been commenting on how much happier I seem regarding wedding planning and I honestly have to say that I feel like a weight has been lifted! I'm a people pleaser and our wedding was just becoming this huge party that was designed to please everyone else and fit their needs rather than a celebration of our love and commitment to each other.Summary:

Summarize: You forgot the  actual  best tip of all: FEED your pet well. If you can buy your food at a grocery store, I'd start thinking twice. Remove foods that contain corn for instance, dog's cannot digest it. There are plenty more examples, but essentially we are what we eat, and the same goes for dogs. I worked with a vet who once said if people just fed their dogs better food, I'd probably be out a job.   Eating well prevents future illness, reduces chances for joint and bone problems, cancers, vision and nearly loss, baldness or rough coats, infections, and disease, and way, way more. If you're unsure, ask a nutritionist, your vet's generally have their own expensive brands they're willing to sell you. But only because they get a kickback, and their brands are generally nothing special. (Unless there's a special food req'd for a condition)Summary:
Summarize: A ton of detail to follow, because the situation is strange. But please help-- I am open to suggestion because i'm tired of wishing that i have a shot with girls. i know i can do better because i am better.   I'm a college student. I've known this girl since i've been at school because I'm a swimmer and she's a diver here. She dated one of the older guys on my team for the first couple years i was here but has been single since then. The attraction for me has always been there, but because of a bro code our team adheres to she has been "off limits". But its been long enough that the bro code doesn't apply, and this girl is a  10  (defined by me as a 9, plus 1 for an x factor). She is short, blonde, stunning, constantly smiling, and (x factor) also has big boobs. She's known me this whole time as a friend of her x boyfriend, but lately since i've had a class with her we have had some deeper talks. On my end, i can say with confidence that i am an attractive person--smart, really tall, really fit, and funny. All i want is guidance on how to shift the power. she is used to guys either drooling over themselves or completely ignoring her bc of her ex boyfriend. The question--  how do i get her out of her comfort zone with me and build attraction on the low key?  other teammates can't know yet that i am try to build this relationship. i suck mainly at texting, and being forward when i need to be. but i know i have the ability to be whatever i have to be to get this girl. i just want a starting point from you guysSummary:

Summarize: Sure, if you're comfortable completely ignoring the reason that meaning should be preserved in communication, lest the language be used against us by tyrants who wish to oppress us.  This video, and the attitude that spawns these spurious and wholly misdirected arguments against clarity in communication, fosters its own egoism and smugness.  Prescriptivism is dead, no doubt, but that doesn't entitle every moronic asshat on the internet to participate in the  devolution  of the language.   [Not all change is good, my friend.

Summarize: Ok so this didn't happen today but happened a few years ago! At the time of the the fuck up I was about 13 or 14 years old!   This happened durning the school holidays. And I was stuck at home while my parents were at work. On that day my gran was at the house with me and as with most 13 year olds I got bored of being stuck in the house and decided to go outside and find something to occupy my tiny mind. Being a boy at that age I loved playing with fire and setting things on fire. So I had a magnifying glass and was burning holes into leaves and setting small pieces of paper alight. That soon become unsatisfactory to the arsonist inside me and wanted bigger flames. This is where things start becoming a fuck up. So I sit for a while and think how can I get bigger fires going and then a little light bulb went on. Why not take an aerosol tin of deodorant and a lighter and make a flames by spraying the aerosol onto the open flame. I run inside get my deodorant and take a lighter from the kitchen all while my gran was sleeping in the chair. I go outside and do a few bursts of flames and with the can of spray and lighter and thought it was great. Once again I got bored of it and wanted to up the excitement some more. I wonder around the garden and see and old tree, this tree was semi dead at the time and it was a sort of palm tree. So this tree was standing about 1,5m from the house so it was pretty close and was just taller than the house, if I had to guess the height I'd say about 3,5m or more. The thing about this tree is that it had weird little wooden stick things that stuck out of it. And I thought hmm that will be fun to burn. I proceed to douse one of the little wooden spikes with the deodorant, what I didn't realize about the tree was that it had like this fine "hair" ( like the hair you find on the outside of a coconut) around the trunk that ran all the way up the tree and in the process of covering the stick with the deodorant I got some on this highly flammable hair. Here's where the story heats up ( pun intended ) I set the little stick on fire and of course the flame carries to this hair around the tree and next thing I knew the fire was all the way at the top of the tree. It had climbed the tree so quickly I didn't realize what happened until I saw the smoke. Immediately a wave of panic hits me, what if the fire spreads to the house cause we have wooden fascia boards and if that catches on fire the house will be toast. Luckily the tree was still alive at the top and went leaves weren't really catching on fire but the truck was burning up quickly. So I run around the corner to fetch the hose pipe as I run around the corner with it I realize it's not going to be long enough to reach the tree and I drop it and think of another way. I run into the house with the tree still burning and get out one of my moms big Tupperware bowls and run back to the tree, all while my gran is still fast asleep. By this point the smoke is now rising quickly so I run to the pool and fill the bucket with water run back to the tree and threw the water at the flames, I repeated this action about 3 or 4 times until the fire was out. Once the fire was out I took damage control, I looked around and the house was fine but the tree was black around the back and if it wasn't dead then it would be now. Thinking I got away with this without any serious trouble I went back into the house and watched some tv. Later that evening my dad came home and I was in my room when I heard him at the front door talking to the next door neighbour. Few minutes later he came into my room to question me. Apparently the next door neighbour saw the smoke in the back yard and asked my dad if everything was fine. I came clean to the crime and showed my dad the tree. I got grounded for a month and the next day and for the rest of the week I had to go to work with my dad. Keep in mind that my dad works at a bank. If I was bored before, I was definitely bored then!   The tree was removed a few years later removed because I ended up killing it!Summary:

Summarize: Before I go on my discussion, I must say that I'm a huge Wondo fan. Great attitude, great work ethic and he appears to be an outstanding human being. I loved him when we had him (despite not playing much) and I love him to this day.   However, I've never felt Wondo was good enough USMNT. People say he's the Twellman of this cycle but I felt Twellman might have been better. I've always seen Wondo's a jack of all trades, master of none. As a striker, he's average in a lot of categories, namely technical ability, athleticism, aerial ability and hold up/linking play. This sounds bad but in reality, it's pretty good given many are only average at only a few of those skills listed but poor in others.   What Wondo does have more than any other striker in the MLS is crazy smart movement inside the 6 yd box that causes nightmares for defenders. In the MLS, that's been huge but I always felt he didn't have another gear to play internationally. It feels that Wondo always plays at 100%, which is awesome, it's just that his 100% isn't as high as others. I mean you could see in the 2013 Gold Cup : he started off crazy good against minnows, but as the tournament went on and the competition got stiffer, he became ineffective, eventually losing his starting spot in the last two games. I mean, look at his international scoring record, beyond the Mexico goal (which was classic Wondo "right person right place" off a missed header), it's not all that impressive.   I don't think Wondo has had a hardtime winning over casual USMNT, I think he's had a hard time winning over even the hardcore USMNT beyond being a fan favorite. What did we all say when he made the 23? "This guy is a pure poacher and it makes sense to have him at the end of a game". That point blank miss didn't help his cause but he shouldn't be remember only for it. However, I do think the criticism of Wondo at an international level is fair as he hasn't had the same impact as he has in the MLS. I mean think about, Eddie Johnson, the dickish human being that he may be, is far better/consistent at the international level than Wondo despite being a fraction as effective at the MLS level.Summary:
In short: Before going to my discussion, I must say that I am a big fan of Wondo. Great attitude, great work ethic and seems to be an exceptional human being. I loved him when we had him (despite not playing much) and I love him to this day. However, I have never felt that Wondo was quite good at USMNT. People say he is the Twellman of this cycle, but I felt that Twellman could have been better. I have always seen that Wondo is a jack of all the trades, master of none. As a striker, he is an average in many categories, namely, technical ability, athletics, air capacity and keeping the game. This sounds bad but in reality, it is quite good that many people have an average in just one of those skills listed but poor in others. What Wondo has more than any other striker in the world of the MLS is the best in the world of gladia, but he does not feel the best in the world of glaciation. What he has in the world of glaciation and in the world of the world of the result of the, but he does not.
Summarize: I am one of the people who complains about the quality of the "free" monthly games that have been offered for PS4, but that's but to say I don't try them. I have no idea what a "rogue-like" game is but I have to say the initial descriptions I read of this game didn't really make it sound very interesting and honestly I had no idea what they were even referring to when they said as a player I'd be "matching" things.  It certainly didn't sound like it would be that fun.   But I downloaded it anyway. I haven't had the money to buy a game since I got Watchdogs and I just wanted to play something new. At first I thought it looked like a really cheesy sort of kids game but as I began to play it I started to understand more and more about what all the reviews for this game were referring to when they talked about matching and your book of secrets to help you remember what combinations work to do special things.   And man...what do you know? This game is really pretty fun. A lot of people say they couldn't play it for long but I have to say I have been playing it for almost 30 hours now and I still keep discovering new objects and secrets. This is a testament to how much I suck partly--I have only made it to day 5 so far!! I can't get past it! It's hard! But I keep trying. Every try is different. Even though I have made virtually zero progress in two days of playing this for hours I am still having fun trying to make it further. I can't tell you anything about the story or any of that. I can just tell you that this game is a giant puzzle that changes every time and it really takes a lot of strategy.   Maybe other people find this game super easy, I don't know. There has to be a few other people out there who find the game as tough to play as I do. Does anybody that finds this game simple have any recommendations for someone who is struggling? There aren't really walkthroughs or tips available for this since it is procedurally generated so it changes every time you play.   The one tip I have found that helps me a little is to throw the kids into the fire. This turns them into "precocious kids" which will follow you instead of having to be carried/thrown. Anyone else have anything they can add?Summary:
I know I don't know what it is. I don't know what it is that a "drug-like" game is but I have to say the initial descriptions that I read of this game didn't really make appear a very interesting game and honestly I had no idea what they were doing when they said like a game I wouldn't look like it would be fun. But I didn't have the money to buy a game since I had guard dogs and I just wanted to play something new. At first I thought it was a really boring game but as I started playing it, I started to understand more and more what all the critics for this game could still do.
I have no idea what a "rogue-like" game is, but I must say the first descriptions I have read of this game have not really been very interesting and honestly said I had no idea what they were referring to at all when they said that I was "matching" things. It certainly didn't sound like it would be fun. But I still started to understand what all the reviews for this game were because I bought a game because I have watchdogs and I just wanted to play something new. At first I thought it looked like a really kitschy kind of kids game to do, but as I started to play it I've got more and more about what the reviews for this game were referring to when they all tried to help any attempt but other secrets to work the combinations to do special things. What else do you know?
In short: I am one of the people who complain about the quality of the monthly "free" games that have been offered for PS4, but that is but to say that it does not test them. I have no idea what a game is like "like a game" but I have to say the initial descriptions that I read of this game do not really make sound a very interesting game and honestly I had no idea what they meant even when they say as a player that it would be "matching" things. It certainly does not sound like it would be so fun. But I downloaded it anyway. I have not had the money to buy a game since I have Watchdogs and I just wanted to play something new. First, I thought it seemed like a very cheesy game of kids but as I started to understand more and more about what all the criticisms for this game were referring to when they talked about what could be made much more difficult.
Summarize: Let's be honest here, even though we're all atheists, it kind of sucks that once we die, we merely cease to exist. How awesome would it be if sometime in the future they were able to "upload" our consciousness onto some type computer program with a "virtual heaven". Don't stop reading, lol. Hear me out!   But yeah, it would be awesome, right? Everyone would be uploaded onto the same computer so it would basically be like you never died. And because it's virtual, they could add tons of cool shit like flying and teleportation (basically anything you could ever imagine). It would feel exactly like real life except with unlimited amounts of perks and awesome features. If for whatever reason you would rather cease to exist, I'm sure they would have a feature that would allow you to do that.   Anyways, this is something I've always thought about because I've always been depressed by the fact that once we die, that's it. Hopefully some crazy smart scientist/programmer reads this and gets started ASAP.Summary:
Let's sum up: Let's be honest here, even if we're all atheists, it fears that once we die, we won't give up on existence. What would it be great if, in the future, they could "unload" our consciousness on a computer program of type with a "virtual sky." Let's not stop reading, lol. Listen to me! But yes, that would be great, wouldn't it? Everyone would be downloaded to the same computer to be like you never died. And because it's virtual, they could add tons of cool stuff like flying and teleporting (mostly everything you could imagine). It would feel exactly like real life except with unlimited amounts of awesome benefits and functionality. If for whatever reason you would prefer to cease to exist, I'm sure they would have a feature that would allow you to do it. In short, it's something I've always thought about because I've always been depressed by the fact that we would die, that's what it is.

This is just a differentiation made between more and "less" dangerous substances (like the difference there could be between theft and murder). Unfortunately, Italy isn't organized enough in order to get Marijuana legal, because the government would be able to handle the illegal traffics (which are already very much present)Summary:

Summarize: This is the most narrow minded and uninformed argument in the tablet debate right now.   Android devices have a very wide array of screen sizes, resolutions and ratios so all apps are designed to scale to work on multiple devices. Nearly every single app on the Android market works fine on a tablet.   The apps for iOS however, are not. They are designed nearly pixel-for-pixel meaning they either don't scale to the iPad screen or they scale improperly causing an offset pixel effect making them appear blurry.Summary:

Summarize: If this happened a few days ago, I'd be enraged. However, with all of the talk about devs needing money, I'm only slightly mad, but not because of the mandatory premium account to play. The iOS and Steam versions of the game are paid. Only the android version was free. Now all 3 of them are the same. That's ok with me and I'd gladly buy premium to support them.   However, what's not cool is that there was no warning about this. I've gotten up to mission 23 by grinding 1ups in the earlier missions, and now the game can only go up to mission 5, unless you buy premium. This means all of my progress was lost.   Well, not really; and that's the second problem. Buying premium will also unlock all missions, all weapons and boost me to lvl 55 (max lvl). I'm the kind of player that likes working for my progress. Having all the missions unlocked and my level boosted to max makes me feel like I cheated.   There are good ways and bad ways of handling updates and monetization, but I feel like Phenomenon Games and BulkyPix handled this poorly. I'm going to buy premium because I really enjoy playing this game, but it's going to leave a bad taste in my mouth.   Link to the game:Summary:

Summarize: Fossil fuels play a role as well, predictably enough. Russia is the largest supplier of natural gas to Europe- about 25% of their total consumption-and more than two thirds of that runs through Ukrainian pipelines. In the past decade there have been numerous spats centered around transport fees and Ukraine's habit of stealing gas on its way to Europe, including a couple of incidents where Russian suppliers turned off the faucet entirely as retaliation. This instability upset a number of European nations who like having a reliable supply of natural gas, which is where the Middle East comes into play.   Large natural gas fields in Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and Iran threaten Russian dominance over the European gas supply, but currently there's no good way for that gas to get there. A number of pipelines have been proposed, and they all have different implications for the countries they run through, but what they all have in common is that they run through unstable places that don't like the West and that none of those places are Russia. A big part of the reason why Russia is unwilling to help with the whole Syria thing- and Middle Eastern issues in general- is that the current administrations of, instability within, and UN economic sanctions against Syria and Iran are the biggest barriers to oil supply routes from the Middle East to Europe.   Securing a stable future for the pipelines that run through Ukraine is critical to Russia's energy strategy, and while Crimea is far away from the pipelines it is a sensible strategic starting point for a much bolder attempt to reassert control over the region.

Summarize: I know, I love puns too much, but I can't help it. Here's my situation.   In 2 weeks from today (4/21), I'll turn 22. That's 22 years of having never even held a girls hand. I've been single my entire life. Not too long, I know, but I had my first crush when I was 5, and failed since then. To be fair, I'm also very picky with girls, and only find somebody I like once every 2 or 3 years. I recently liked a girl, and found it odd that she hugs everybody but me. Fatter, slimmer, taller, shorter, and all races. I have no clue why, but it hurts. I live off of hugs. Now, I'm dumb, and told her I liked her after a while, hoping she might like me too. No, of course not. I'm The Friend. It's like some sort of gift. I'm always a close friend. Forever a close friend. So not only do I fail, I'm reminded of it forever. That's one thing.   I've been a pushover for a while. People cutting in line in front of me, people making me dodge them as they attempt to walk through me, even a sales clerk yelling at me for picking something I dropped once and accidentally putting it in the wrong spot. That last one made something switch in me. I put all my things back and left. Now I don't let people do those things to me. I make them get behind me in lines, I let them collide with me and bounce back because I'm sturdy as all hell. I started standing up for myself. That had made me proud. Now, though, most of my friends are getting annoyed with me over it. So by growing a spine, I'm damaging my ties with my friends, especially the girl I mentioned before.   My birthday is two weeks away, and nobody seems to care. There are two things they're excited for. 1) Diablo 3, and 2) another friend's birthday which happens to be on the same day. It's kind of depressing. I mean, it's not a hard day to remember. 5/5, Cinco de Mayo, etc. Plus it's on Facebook, and I've been mentioning it, hoping somebody would say something. If they were the kind for a surprise party, that'd be one thing. But they're not.   My friends are really great people, don't get me wrong. Last year one of my friends made me an awesome card with Mudkips. First card I've received (besides family, since they kinda have to or that's just really depressing) in a long time, and it was awesome. I love all of them. But I feel I'm pushing them away without meaning to, and of course don't know how to make it stop.   I know this post seems complainy and long and overly-detailed and disorganized, but I've been holding it in for a while. I want nobody to know, so I'm using this account. Not a throw-away, mind you, just a new, secret account, with a Zelda reference in it. I intend to contribute to the community best I can.Summary:

Not too long, I know, but I had my first crash when I was 5 and I failed since. To be fair, I'm also very difficult with girls, and finding someone I love once every 2 or 3 years.

I'm stupid, and told her that I hug her after a while, hoping she likes me too.
Now that people make me grow up, people make me lose my mind. Now, it makes me lose my mind. Now, it makes me lose my head. Now, it makes me lose my head. Now, it makes me lose my head, it makes me lose my head. Now, I like a girl, and I tell her that I like it after a while, I hope I like it too. No, of course not. I am the Friend.

Summarize: I'll try to keep this short because I'm so beside myself. And, just, incoming. Pity party/woe is me/angst/nobody loves me/horrible person with horrible thoughts bullshit incoming...   I've been dating my boyfriend (27/M) for close to two years. We've been living together since June of last year due to individual circumstances that lead up to that decision. No one needs to tell me that was a bad idea, as I'm reaping the repercussions.   Not even a year after we started dating, because of being overworked and just plain lazy, my boyfriend ignored me for an entire six months and masturbated in secret. Leaving me to wonder why he wouldn't come to bed, why our sex life tanked, why nothing I was doing was turning him on or getting him interested in me. Sex, to me, is important, I love to bond, I love to make my partner feel good, and I would hope they would do the same for me. My boyfriend is very much more of a quality time person, gets his intimacy from day to day pleasantries, eating dinner together, etc. He was getting his needs met during this six month period and, I guess, just never thought to give a shit about me.   This whole situation has turned me into a fucking monster.   I am sad and angry all the time. I've been very depressed because I just feel fat, ugly, stupid for ever believing him when he said he loved me, and just "less than". Until very recently, I had a serious addiction to alcohol, that sent me to the hospital once, unbeknownst to him. We're in therapy, he recognizes why he did was wrong, and why, he knows he's screwed this relationship up almost irreparably, and I'm trying to work with him and trying to learn to forgive. But, last night, I almost lost it on him.   I noticed when we came home from therapy yesterday that his mood tanked. I asked him what was wrong, and he said that he wasn't sure if I'd be sticking around to fix this with him, and ever marry him, because that's what he ultimately wanted out of our relationship. He later admitted he just wanted me to tell him everything would okay. That is what I should have said, 100%. Instead, I dodged his feelings and went on a diatribe about how I didn't have a timeline on forgiving him, that I was seriously, deeply hurt still, and didn't think six months was ample time to get over it, considering I've just only recently decided to get a handle on my health in an attempt to improve my self-esteem. He immediately got upset and yelled at me, "This is why I never fucking talk to you!" And turned his back to me (we were in bed). I kind of tried to keep my cool, but ultimately had an anxiety attack, and started defending myself. I basically retold the story of how he wasted six months of my life, cheated me out of a satisfying sex life because of his own selfishness and laziness. He told me I was turning the conversation away from him, making it all about me. I agreed, telling him it's rather hard to sympathize with someone who willingly ignores his girlfriend's needs because "I was tired, and pleasing another human being is too hard". Yes, he actually said that to me. He tells me two wrongs don't make a right, basically, that I can't suck him dry, and ask for all of this physical attention and yet make no attempt to meet his needs. He says our dynamic right now is unhealthy. I agreed, but, pointedly explained that I was justified, and not just doing it because "it's too hard/It's too much work". You know, I'm not a lazy asshole (or wasn't). I busted my ass and gave him way more than he ever deserves, and he took me for granted, and hell yeah, I'm fucking pissed.   We ended the conversation without a resolution, and went to bed.   But, holy fuck. I just want to strangle him. When he says things like this, it comes off as, "I apologized, started doing everything you asked,"(that he should have been doing in the first fucking place, but, I digress) "WHY WON'T YOU FORGIVE ME AND GET OVER IT???"   I'm so out of my mind, confused, over all of this. I'm pissed that he's making such a big deal about me still being angry about being outright ignored because considering your SO's needs are "too hard", and I don't want him to have the security he previously had, because I feel he just wants something to abuse, again. When he told me that he felt I didn't love him anymore, I had to pause and redirect the focus of the conversation because, I honestly don't know anymore. I got burned, bad. I don't want to go through any of this ever again. He says he just feels like he's paying a debt, and nothing will get better, because it's been six months and I've still barely loosened up about it. I can't help but agree, part of me wants him to suffer what I suffered. Fuck him, right? But, logically, and on an empathetic note, it's 100% wrong to be like this with him.   So I'm very lost, reddit. What do I do now? I want to work through this. How do I start to see him with at least a semblance of what I once did? How do I learn to respect him, again? How can I let go of all of this anger? I've gotten so bad since we started seeing our therapist, that she suggested I go on antidepressants because of how much more miserable I look every week. Every other aspect of my life is tied to this relationship. My job, my friends, things I value, and love, and want to be around to cherish. I used to have my boyfriend on that list, but now, every time we're in a room together... I don't know. I'm so tense, I feel like a burden, I feel like he'd be better off married to his hand, or someone he actually fucking loves, and treats them the way he should have been treating me. I'm so lost...Summary:

No one has to tell me that was a bad idea as I reap the effects. Not even a year after we turned him on and just lazy, my friend ignores me for a whole year and masturbates secretly. Let me ask why he doesn't come to bed, why our sex life is doing, why nothing I did, turned him on or he cares for me. Sex, to me, I love to bind, I think my partner feel good, and I would hope that they do the same. My friend is very much more time to eat his intimacy.
Summarize: I recently made huge progress with my consistency just by setting up few rules for myself. I started playing ONLY AK-47 and M4A4 on buy rounds. I've never used Aug/SG anyway, but I did sometimes try to AWP, get a scout on a force buy or an autosniper when I had 16k$. On force buys (only once or twice per game) I get Famas/Galil and whenever I can't afford one of those I just get a pistol, never a shotgun, SMG or any scopes rifle. So as I now had an AK/M4 most of the time I sat down, learnt those two spray patterns by heart and told myself to ALWAYS spray with the exception places of Long A on D2 or Yard on Nuke. I used to think I was decent at tapping, but in reality half of my games I was doing fine but the other half I was sitting on three frags blaming my mouse, warm up, practice and whatever what lead me to wasting hours on headshot only servers trying to become ScreaM who I clearly wasn't. Being able to control your spray (more or less) until the last bullet may not make you any quicker, but it gurantees you the kill at some point. And on MG rank where I'm currently playing, it's not about how fast you flick but if you manage to get a total of 100 damage before reloading. Being able to consistently secure all "easy kill" like people showing you your back and even being able to spray down two or three at once consostently is already pretty good. Aside from that knowing I can kill everyone at some point (unlike before where i tapped 10 shots doing 0dmg, sprayed another 10 bullets above his head and then switched in panic to my pistol just to reset the recoil while i still had 10 bullets left in my assault rifle) is also a huge confidence boost. I actually stopped playing DM and doing any sort of warm up altogether yet still am far more consistent than before. Only thing I do is practice my sprays during the 3 mins warmup peroid before any comp match. :)Summary:
I started playing ONLY AK-47 and M4A4 on buying tricks. I never used Aug/SG anyway, but I sometimes tried AWP, getting a scout on a buying force or a autosniper when I had $16k. On strength buys (once or twice per game) I get Famas/Galil and every time I can't afford one of those I just got a gun, never a hunting rifle, SMG or any shotgun. So, as I now had an AK/M4 most of the time I sat down, I learned these two models of heart spraying and I told ALWAYS to spray with the exceptional places of Long A on D2 or Yard on Nuke. I thought I wasn't decent to hit a little further, but actually I was doing half of my games that I couldn't do, but I sat on three frigs before I was blazing my mouse and I didn't lose what I was doing. I started to play on buying tricks.
I've never used Aug/SG anyway, but I've sometimes tried AWP to buy a scout on a force or an autoniper when I had 16k$. On power purchases (just one or twice per game) I get Famas/Galil and if I can't afford one of which I can only get a gun, never a shotgun, SMG or all rifle scopes rifle. So, as I now had an AK/M4 most of the time I sat down, learned the two half of the damage from heart and told me that I kept spraying with the exception of places from Long A to D2 or Yard on Nuke. I used to think I was decent at tapping, but in reality I was half the game I was good at typing, but the other half I log on three questions blaming my mouse, warming up and whatever I play on headmant servers to spray.

Summarize: Shortly after I began working at a particular job, we moved to a different location in the building.  When we moved, one of my coworkers embedded a speaker inside my cubicle wall.  It so happened that the desk on the other side of the cubicle wall was unoccupied, so this coworker hooked up a small computer in the cabinet there, which was connected to the embedded speaker.  He would then sporadically log in to this computer remotely and use the microsoft speech function to say my name and other random things.  Of course, when I asked my coworkers if they heard a noise, they all treated me like I was crazy.  They finally revealed the truth to me on my last day at that job.Summary:
Summarize: Just don't be  that  guy from one of my schools..   It was the first year at a craft/business oriented school and we had  that  guy in 'theoretical' engineering. Nobody had any previous experience and we didn't know shit. So on the first day he pulls out 2 pieces of paper, that had maybe 10 blank spots. that we were supposed to fill in. Can't be that hard right?   It took us 4, in words FOUR, fucking hours to complete it and we didn't learn shit. Why? Because in his mind it somehow made sense, that we would know about these things..   He spent at least  10 minutes  per blank spot asking "if anybody knew anything about it", because "it can't be that difficult" and "how do you  think  this might work?". Needless to say, that nobody knew shit about certain regulations and stuff and it was a trainwreck of clueless students, awkward silence and limited&forced interaction. We DON'T KNOW! Stop holding that information hostage. You can ask 10 more times and we STILL won't know. So spill the information, that you're supposed to teach, so we can all move on instead of wasting 4 hours, because you were to fucking lazy to prepare proper material for new students.   Best part was when he spend like an hour in that same terrible teaching style to have  us  figure out a math equation for calculacting the thickness of  bent metal sheets  and how you had to choose the thickness, measure and bend them, so that the final result would be within industry tolerances..in a class on the first day, where nobody had any clue how to solve 'advanced' math shit like that..   I hated that guy so much, not only because he was a mid 30 'sunny boy' that tried  so hard  to be young&cool, but also because he was a terrible teacher, that shouldn't be teaching. A 'quiz' might be appropriate once a topic was fully covered to see how much the students have picked up. But doing it on the first day of a new topic, where nobody can know anything, that's a dick move and a waste of everyones time.Summary:

I'm not necessarily limiting this to a specific type of racing; I could do any or all types, realistically. Or, on the other hand, how could I get a career as a professional driver, such as stunt-work or course-driving (even performance driving)?Summary:

Summarize: I met this girl (F20) last summer, and knew she was in a somewhat serious relationship when I first met her. We became very fast friends, and now almost a year later she is solely the person I rely on and go to for all the shit that happens in my life. I know that this is wrong of me, and I have tried to stop relying on her for help so much, but with no avail.   She is getting married very soon, and has asked me to attend her wedding, which I feel obligated to, but I just don't know if I can. Could it make any difference if I told her how I felt, or just do I hope my feelings go away at some point? I know I shouldn't have gotten these feelings for her, but there was no stopping it, and I don't think I could stand to lose her as my friend.Summary:
Summarize: He's 25 and I'm 20f. We've been together almost a year and for the past couple of months we've had an on-off relationship. Until a few months ago he was an amazing boyfriend, seemed happy with me but he would often confide in me how he felt stuck in a rut of just working a dead-end job and not bettering himself. I've always tried to just listen, and encourage him. Just generally be as supportive as I could be.   Now he goes back and forth a lot, he'll say he loves me and wants to be with me and make things work, we'll get back together and things will be great for a while until he eventually starts acting very apathetic; he seems uninterested in pretty much everything, it's like nothing really makes him happy anymore and he starts neglecting our relationship which leads to another break up. He recently quit his job without even having another one lined up. When I asked why he quit, he had no reason at all. He said he just didn't want to work there anymore. He hasn't been applying for jobs at all, he doesn't go to school and he's moving back into his parents' house next week. Now he just sleeps until the late afternoon and plays video games. He's been neglecting his friendships as well. The last time we saw each other, we got into an argument and he broke up with me. He said he didn't want to 'deal' with anything anymore, he's sick of being stressed. He got really angry with me and told me he didn't want to hear from me again. I told him not to say something he couldn't take back, he apologized and told me to just give him some time to himself. He was still really mad and it's pretty clear he doesn't want to speak to me for a while.   I really think he's either depressed or bipolar. I could be wrong, maybe I'm just trying to find a reason why he's given up on us... I don't know. I know I should just leave him alone, I just need some support and maybe some advice? Has anyone else been in this kind of situation? Does he sound depressed or did he just fall out of love or something? I've asked him numerous times why he keeps alternating between being an awesome bf to a shitty bf and he says he honestly doesn't know. I've frequently asked point-blank if he just isn't that into me or if he just doesn't want a relationship and he promises that he loves me and is very into me, and wants to be with me etc... But then he neglects the relationship and one of us ends up breaking it off again. I've told him over and over again that if he just isn't in love with me anymore to tell me and he still insists that that isn't it and that he doesn't know what's wrong with him but he does want to try and he 'absolutely' wants to be with me and treat me the way I deserve. I've also asked him before if he thinks he's depressed and he kinda got defensive and said he probably is before he changed the subject and told me to drop it. Depression also runs in his family, and one of his close relatives had severe depression and committed suicide a couple years ago.   I feel crazy, I know I should walk away but I love him very much and I'm so worried about him. Even if we're not together I want to be there for him if he really has some kind of disorder or depression... now I'm just rambling... Anyone have any advice?Summary:
He told me he needed a little time, he told me he needed a little time. He said he needed a little love. Until a few months ago, he was an incredible boyfriend, he seemed happy with me, but he often told me how he felt stuck in a rumor of working death and not getting better. I always tried to listen to him and encourage him.
He didn't want him to really hallucinate' he's now hallucinating' he really has a down-of-off relationship. Until a few months ago he was an amazing friend, seemed happy with me, but he would often be familiar with me as he gets into a rut just in a dead job and doesn't improve himself. I've always tried to just listen, and encourage him. Just generally as supportive as I could be. Now he goes back and forth a lot, he'll say he's really happy more and he starts to neglect our relationship that leads to another break. He's recently left his job without another start clear. When I asked why he had no reason at all, he said that he's not really happy anymore and he's starting to neglect our relationship that leads to another break.
He has been together for almost a year and for the past two months we have had a supportive relationship. Until a few months ago he was an amazing boyfriend, he seemed happy with me, but he often trusted me in how he felt trapped in a routine of working a dead end job and not getting better at himself. I have always tried to listen and encourage him. I just generally be as understanding as I could be. Now he goes and goes a lot, he says he loves me and wants to be with me and make things work out, we are going to be back together and something has been fine for a while until finally he starts doing me a very apathetic job.
Summarize: I got my start by just doing tutorials. Then when I felt I had a good handle on everything I started looking at things I liked, and tried my best to recreate it with my own flair thrown in. A lot of my free time now is spent "reskinning" apps, changing up websites that I like. A lot of them never make it anywhere, but I found that it has been a good way for me to see what works and what doesn't work. A lot of it just ends up in a folder somewhere, but I find it nice to look back at files and see where I've come from, inspires me to keep pushing more and more.Summary:

Summarize: I got relatively sudden suicidal thoughts last Friday, and then after that I have gotten to a point where I feel like those thoughts are from another person, and right now I'm not sure. My personal background is that when summer came I just hung out with my parents, didn't leave the house much, and my friends are all away so I just sit around. It seems like night time is when I get the majority of the thoughts. I wake up maybe an hour after going to sleep, even if I was really tired, and there's a bad feeling in my stomach, and I feel really, really low. Today's been a rough day, but here is my question:   Are these with me forever? I feel awful and I've dealt with the feelings for less than a week, and there are people who have had them for more than 10 years. I don't want these forever. I saw the Askreddit post where some guy said he was happy, but still wanted to die, making me think these are something you can't escape, just try to ignore as long as you can. I have personally thought of suicide before this, in a really narcissistic "what would they do if I was gone, they would be so sad" way, but never the scary way where I feel like the thoughts are a disease until recently. Right now, one of the biggest things keeping me far away from the urges is the impact it would have on family, but I see people so worn down by the thoughts that they don't let it stop them. I'm worried, and even more worried the way I see some people get no help from therapists, psychologists, or treatment in general, like it's as inevitable as it seems.   So, yeahSummary:
Summarize: Well, in August of last year I found out my wife was cheating on me.  At the time, I'd been with her for about 9 years.  She cheated on me with my best friend at the time and our divorce went final in February of this year. I haven't seen or talked to directly to her since August and everything is falling into place for me.   Throughout this time, I've known that I want to date again, and hopefully get married and eventually have kids.  I've always told people that I wasn't ready to date, and I was waiting until I knew I was ready for that again.  After some therapy and figuring things out, I haven't thought about my ex for a long time, I feel really good, I've dropped 6.5% body fat, I'm graduating college in a little over a month, and I'm for once in my life comfortable talking to strangers about absolutely nothing.   Enter a wrench: This morning I went to lunch with a friend. He stayed for a little while and eventually left.  The bartender, who's job is to be friendly and personable, talked to me for a while.  She's really cute, she smiled a lot, we talked about school for the both of us.  She goes to the same school as me, and we both have classes starting 7/13(different classes).  We talked about Art(which is her Major) and talked about her interpretation of some pieces. She's really interesting, had a lot to say and I was pretty impressed with how she spoke about things she was interested in. As she was tending to other tables/patrons she constantly kept looking at me.  I understand this is her job. I honestly don't think she was doing it because she was "checking me out" or anything, but my friend that was with me texted me after a while and said "dude, did you get the bartender's number?" After a sheepish no from me, my friend goes "she seemed like she was into you, that's why I left." That instilled a lot of doubt and got me thinking, and that's when I realized I was attracted to her and thought about being ready to date.   The entirety of my life I've been oblivious to women showing their interest, which mostly worked out as I was taken. Now that I'm not, I realize I have an awful sense of social cues when it comes to that kinda thing.  But I also realize that if I don't ever try to ask someone to hang out, there's no chance they'll say yes(thanks Sir Gretzky).   Do I trust my very inexperienced gut, just let it go and write it off as her being a bartender, being bored, and doing her job? Or do I finally jump back on the horse and go back next week and gather some more information(ask her out)?Summary:

I have not seen myself with her since August, and everything is there for me. I have always said that I was not ready to date, and I have waited until I knew I was ready for that again. After a therapy and finding out things out, they really nothing. Give a hook: I really did good, I dropped 6.5% body fat, I'm just college in a little more than a month, and I'm pleasantly talking to strangers about absolutely nothing for once in my life. Give a wreath: This morning I went for lunch with a friend. He stayed for a little while and finally left.

Summarize: My parents divorced when I was in kindergarten. My father remarried within about a year and moved to a different region of US. My younger brother and I had to take ~2.5 hour flight  alone  to visit them about 3x per year for a total of ~6 weeks. This was a few decades ago, before child support was really enforced, so my mother was the sole provider. My father lived decently, my guess is that if he didn't  have  to pay, why pay?   We never had a normal parent-child relationship, but then again, there's no standard definition of "normal." He & my stepmother had a kid as I was graduating from high school. She passed away a few years later, so he had nannies for many years.   My college years exposed some more bumps in the road, my father wanted me to be a CEO or investment banker or something and make a ton of money, but that really wasn't for me. We didn't talk for a few years, he was pissed and disappointed.   Today, he's remarried again, to a very nice woman with a close family, of which my half-sibling is enjoying the benefit of. I wish I'd had a nice stepfamily that felt I was part of their family, I didn't, but I'm glad my half-sibling does. I may meet up with my father at a vacation destination in the near future. It's been hard to set it up because he's there for another reason, and I was only invited because somebody else was vacating one of the rooms earlier than the rest of their family. If it happens and I spend 3-4 days in the same house as him, it will be the most time I've spent with him in about 25 years. We talk about once per week but briefly and about general/superficial things. We've never had a deep conversation. He doesn't seem to care about any of my lifestyle choices as long as I'm respectfully employed (in his opinion) and making money.Summary:
Summarize: Let's start off by saying I don't have the best self-esteem. Most of the time, I'm fine, but my anxiety disorder coupled with ADD can get the best of me.   My boyfriend and I have a great relationship, but whenever I get stressed out while cramming for a test, I procrastinate in a very self-destructive way -- I go through pictures of him and his ex.   For some background, my boyfriend was with his ex [25F] for a year and a half (broke up about two years ago), during which they lived together and traveled the country together in his car. She's semi-internet-famous for "suggestive but innocent" photos she takes of herself, which was what they were focused on during their road trips. These pictures are everywhere - flickr, tumblr, facebook, and whenever I see them, I'm reminded that my boyfriend used to be with someone so much more beautiful than myself. Someone that the internet loves to drool over.   Unfortunately, it's not just pictures of her. When they traveled together, they took lots of artistic "in love" pictures that look like they were meant to be together -- spontaneous kisses, hugs, laughter, waking up in a hotel room together, looking like they're about to have sex on a stove, etc. with comments from him like "this will always be my all time favorite photo in the world. ever <3" or about how the place pictured was where he first told her he loved her (which hurts, because though I know my feelings, he hasn't come to tell me that yet).   Of course, when I would talk to him about how the pictures made me feel, he would tell me that the photos didn't show everything going on in the relationship. He said even though their travels felt like a movie, she was selfish, a cheater, etc.   The problem is that even with him telling me these bad things about her (which I feel so petty for feeling good about) and their relationship, I still feel so distraught when going through these pictures. I know it's in the past and I shouldn't be comparing our relationships, but I have no self control! I'm not always going through their photos -- it's only when I feel stressed out that I go into this terribly destructive mode.   I feel bad because I'm a full time student with a job, so I have no time for road trips like these. Even if I had the time, my dad said he would stop supporting my education if I chose to go on a trip like that with my boyfriend. I feel bad because I'll never be able to go on adventures with him, I'm not as pretty as her, and I will never be as photogenic in pictures with my boyfriend than her in the ones forever framed and fawned upon by the internet.   Help me. I know I'm a complete CRAZY IDIOT for doing this and I've tried stopping, but I can't control myself. I've talked to my boyfriend about it maybe twice, but I don't want to bring it up again as a repeat issue.Summary:
Summarize: Wish i had answered this one earlier - my family of 5 was put up in a London hotel along with a few hundred other passengers of a Qantas A380 flight that had to stop unexpectedly. About 400 people were all sent to this one hotel in the middle of the night. Their was only one man on the desk, and he could not speak English. It took about two hours to actually get into a room. When we got there, we discovered there was not enough beds - it was me and my parents, with only one double bed, however we were assured that a camp bed would be brought up shortly. One hour later, no extra bed. So we called reception, and they said the bed was on its way. Some sheets and a doona appeared, still no bed. In the end, the hotel told me that basically i was expected to sleep on the floor. A five star hotel, and i was told to sleep on the floor. In the end i got about 2 awkward hours of sleep in the same bed as my parents before getting up and going back to the airport.Summary:

Summarize: This may become a wall of text and I'm sorry.   About a month and some change ago I had gotten over a recent breakup and decided to start seeing this guy.   Here's the short (but still a lot of text) history: Last year I was in an open relationship with a womyn that ended this year. The guy that I just ended with today was a guy that I started dating while I was in this relationship with my lady at the time. Long story short, my partner and I had agreed to make each other a priority over our side relationships. Well, after this guy and my partner had some words before they were supposed to meet, my partner decided she did not like him. Thus, I had to end it with this guy. He did not take it well at this time...at all. He got very angry, sent me very long and angry messages. He also sent my partner very long messages. He eventually cooled down.   So, throughout my continuing relationship with my partner, he would pop back into my life and try to see me again. I would tell him that it wouldn't be respectful to my partner.   So let's fast forward to me being a single person. He pops back up into my life. We start hanging out again. Quickly turns into dating and seeing each other almost every night. Things are going great. Except for this. I've been struggling with my sexuality for quite some time now. I do identify as a bisexual person, but the more relationships I find myself in with womyn, the more I prefer them. I just don't get the heart melting feelings with men that I do with womyn. For some reason I thought this guy would be different. I did enjoy his company, I even enjoyed /most/ of the sex. I felt smitten. But I didn't have those feelings. Those feelings when you can't help but smile when you see them, those butterflies, when you feel weak in the knees. So, it got to the point that I was trying to force myself to get those sensations with him. Wouldn't happen. But anyways, I would miss him.   So after a couple times of hooking up, he had gone limp, he swears it wasn't me. He got pretty distant after that. Understandably so, I'm assuming it was performance anxiety and he was simply embarrassed. But, as a result, I didn't see him as often, and like I said I began to miss him.  I tried to make him feel better about the situation and apparently I did, but he never tried to hook up again.   So, he was supposed to go out with me one night. Decided not to. Assuming cause it was at a grimey dive bar, but whatever. He said it had nothing to do with us, but that we would talk about it in person. Well, the next time we hung out in person, we didn't talk about it. I'm sure because we were with friends, but it seems he always wanted to hangout with me with friends after our issues in the bedroom.   After that, we made plans the next day to hang out. When he finally hit me up, it was getting late and he was couple towns over at a beer tasting. It made me a little frustrated that he expected me to wait up. I told him I might fall asleep, and I did. You know, I'm not going to wait for someone that made plans with me to finish their beer and expects me to wait. Well, the next day he seemed pretty mad that I fell asleep. His anger kind of bugged me. But, I still wanted to see him. So, I asked him if he would like to go out with me to this special club night since it only happens once a month. He said no, he was going to hang out with his friends (that he hangs out with every night). At this point, I'm like ok have a good night...and it was like a light switch. I just didn't care anymore. I did not emotionaly care. I did not miss him. Did not want to see him, didn't really care to talk to him. I wasn't angry. I wasn't upset. I was indifferent.   So, I went out to the club anyways with friends. Was open to meeting someone, kind of keeping an eye out for an attractive lady. Didn't meet one, oh well.   So, he (apparently) calls me several times and texts me. I was not expecting to see him that night, so I wasn't paying any attention to my phone. The next day I only see one text from him, and I asked him what was up. He was angry. Again. He said that he left his friends early to hang out with me...well, I didn't know he was gonna do that. At this point, it didn't make me upset. Still did not care.   So, I haven't cared for about four days now.   In these past four days, it really started to hit me about my sexuality. That I'm pretty sure I'm only interested in womyn. Something I'd rather not face, but it's the way it is. Like I said, I WANT to have feelings for this guy, I just can't. Never have had those feelings with a man; even if I did enjoy intimacy and whatnot. The fact that it was so easy to get over him, just like a lot of other men in my life. So hard to fall and so easy to get back up.   I decided to break the news to him today. That I can't live this lie anymore. I can't lead him on, it would only be worse down the line with more time. He did not take it well at all. He cried, told me that I'm forcing myself to be this queer person. Kept asking me what womyn have that he can't offer. Going on about how womyn always just throw him away. I tried to explain that it isn't anything he's doing or isn't doing, just that I don't feel. He told me that my excuse was a cop out, which was rather insulting. I did not like that, but I know he is angry. I did tell him I still want to be friends with him, but it really would've just ended worse. I would've been miserable in the long run, and he would've grown more attatched. He also told me that this isn't the first time a womyn came out to him as she was breaking up with him. Although, he did know that I'm active in the queer community and was okay with letting me date and hook up with womyn...even though I didn't while I was seeing him. I did feel empathetic at this point because he was crying and I've been there with a womyn telling me she's actually straight. He tried grabbing at straws.   "why didn't you tell me sooner"   "why would you have feelings for me at all if you only like womyn"   All in very angry tones. The best I could tell him is that I was still confused up until I've really been chewing on it these past couple days. So. I feel really bad. I do feel like I'm losing something. But, I'm not sad...I'm not angry (besides having my sexuality thrown out the door). I'm not anything. I just feel bad. Bad about myself. We haven't even being seeing each other that long. I feel weird even calling it a breakup. But, I do feel like I broke his heart. And like I said, I don't feel good about it.   I know this is a wall of text, but I'm really curious if anyone could possibly relate to situation like this and help me out with some insight.Summary:
But I'm not about a recent break-up and decided to start with this guy. Here's the short (but still a lot of text) story: Last year I was in an open relationship with a Womyn that ended this year. The guy I just ended up with today was a guy I started with while I was in this relationship with my lady at the time.

Well, after this guy and my partner had some words before they met my partner very long messages, he also sent very long messages. He finally cooled down. So, during my ongoing relationship with my partner, he wouldn't do well at this time. He became very angry, sent me very long and angry messages. He also sent my partners very long messages. He felt to recognize everyone else. So that I returned to my partner, he would pop back in my life and try to see me again.
So I’ve become a wall of text and I’m sorry. A month ago and a little change had overcome a recent break and I decided to start seeing this guy.

He got very angry, he sent me very long and angry messages. He also sent my partner very long messages. He finally cooled down with him.

Summarize: In realta' le donne tedesche non sono abituate ai complimenti, quindi quelle che per noi sono normali gentilezze ("sei carina", "quel vestito ti sta bene", "vuoi un gelato?" o simili) sono considerate quasi corteggiamento.   O meglio, vengono "stordite" da questa cosa mai provata prima.   Un tedesco che esce con una tedesca sarebbe in grado di dire che le scarpe non sono belle, o che lei non balla proprio benissimo, o che in fondo la cena che ha preparato per due si era buona, ma la sua famiglia per tradizione mette a meta' cottura il tarasacco e quindi senza tarasacco non e' la vera ricetta, la prossima volta mettici il tarasacco. Ora, se si trova davanti uno che non dico ci prova spudoratamente ma non la critica su tutto (ribadisco: per i tedeschi essere "molto diretti" e' normale, per gli standard tedeschi dire "il tuo vestito a fiori e' brutto" non ha niente di strano) diciamo che si trova di fronte a questa "situazione nuova" a cui "non e' preparata"Summary:
Summarize: So, here's my experience of the new league system, more evidence as to why I think it should be changed:   About a month ago I went on a 12 game losing streak, and dropped from silver 3 to silver 5 and lost about 3-4 games on 0lp at silver 5. This completely screwed up my mmr, making it nigh on impossible to actually get a game where 1) there were no troll or afks and 2) I was playing well (I do have my occasional bad game).   1month on I've just come out of silver 5 with the help of my plat 4 friend. It took one month.   In 1 week, my same friend got another person from bronze 2-silver 5,saying the players they were put with we're significantly better... Now, I'm better than the person he carried into silver- I can out farm and outplay him in all lanes, he'll he even admits I'm better,  yet he never gets put with trolls and also wins double the amount of LP as me, and loses half   Riot pls, sort this shit out- I'm not complaining about him being on track to getting in a higher league than me, I couldn't give a shit, but this whole "can't drop down tiers" bullshit has seriously screwed up my ranked play :/Summary:

Summarize: In April of last year one of my close friends committed suicide.  We went out the night before, and had a blast before this buddy got rejected, got into a fight, and the night spiraled out of control.  Around noon the next day I went to check on him at his basement apartment.  I walked down the stairs and heard extremely loud reggae music blasting from his stereo.  I banged on the door for a solid ten minutes, during which time I heard the toilet flush (so I knew he was in there/alive).  I figured he didn't want to see me, so I left with a bad feeling.  The fact that I KNEW something was wrong but did nothing to help him has haunted me since that night in April, and the image of the door I should have kicked in will always be with me.Summary:

Summarize: I've know a few people who this happened too. Their family disowned them and  completely  broke contact, one kid hadn't seen or herd form any relative for 7 years. I met most of them when I was in college and every signal one of them were fucked up. They were all horrible people that were well on their way to being sociopaths. Their empathy for others feelings where gone or was ignored, even purposely hurt. When they learned that nobody in their family truly loved them and were just broken and now permanently angry at the world. The worst were the ones who joined the military to ensure that they could never act on their "urges".Summary:

Summarize: Manholes are stolen because they can be sold for scrap iron for a good price and because some cities have special manholes with a unique cover and people want them.   Another item that is stolen that people don't usually know about is wooden pallets. Like the type that you see freight items ship on. Those get stolen all the time. They can be sold for anywhere between 20 - 40 dollars, or more.   I worked for a place that had their pallets kept outside behind the building. The night manager told them not to do it because it was dangerous. Anyways one morning the Day manager came in and found over 30 pallets stolen. He went to ask where the Night Manager was and was told he was down at the police station.   Apparently they found some guys stealing pallets at Night and told them to stop and the guys fired a gun at the night manager. Messed up stuff.Summary:
Summarize: Controlling dc motors from a printer will be tough.   First, you have to understand that those are closed loop systems...there are linear or rotary encoders somewhere in the mechanism. You have to add encoder feedback to your system to use those motors. The system controlling those motors isn't a bang-bang servo system. It is a full PID control with complex accel and decel algorithms, backlash compensation, and a host of other goodies.   The second thing to be aware of is that a printer with it's motors and optical encoders is going to be the cheapest, most primal set of closed loop servo hardware you will ever encounter. The motors are a couple dollars when bought in bulk. The encoders are 50 cents, if. The optical gates are probably from Vishay or similar, and are also less than a dollar. It is all tied together on custom PCBs costing a few cents and FPGAs/ASICs costing a buck or two. However, the control firmware in that printer is some of the most complex out there...beyond what is running a Kollemorgen drive setup, or an 840d.   The reason for this is simple: If you are selling a million printers, spending $100k more for firmware development that lets you save 50 cents a unit by using cheaper parts is a great deal. The secret sauce is in the software.   Anyway,Summary:

Summarize: So since the first day I met my roommate, I knew my roommate and I would have many a heated debate, because he was in the ROTC and was as conservative-minded as one might expect to find in Oklahoma, and I'm a super liberal homosexual. He has said things in the past that made me think it was not the best idea to come out to him, but nothing too bad just the common articulation that he thinks gays shouldn't have the same rights to marriage as straight people. Recently he had to do ALLY training at our college, which is like a certification that you are not a homophobe and if you need to talk you're there to listen. he told me that at the end, he didn't want to be certified because he thought it would look like he "supported the homosexual lifestyle", so I had pretty much decided to just not tell him and then never see him again after this semester.   Last night, we both got in about 4:30 in the morning and were laying in our bunk bed talking about all sorts of random shit, and then somehow we got onto the topic politics (as per usual) and then more specifically his position on homosexuality. I don't know what made me think that this was a great time particularly for me to tell him, but I think it was because i sensed he didn't mean gay people any harm, like some do around here, he was just raised in rural USA with strong Mormon beliefs.  I said something along the lines of "I know this might sound a little crazy but I'm gay, man" to which he replied, "I'm fine with that, i don't really care".Summary:

Summarize: Frankly, I don't see that happening for a while. Developing on Android, while having a lower barrier to entry (free on-device running) is a pain to develop for. I last tried this past summer, with the 2.2 SDK, and while 2.3 is out now, I haven't heard about any major improvements. The GUI design process comes down to writing a bunch of XML by hand. There are some third party tools to try to automate it, but it is nowhere close to Interface Builder/Xcode 4. The process of actually installing the dev tools is a bit circuitous (install the base, download specific components, set paths) compared to iOS (run the Xcode installer, and in Xcode 4 provisioning is a one-click affair).Summary:

Summarize: So I finished week one today, and have to say that I am very proud of myself.   C25K is one of the steps I am taking to improve my life overall.   I found W1D3 harder than either of the first two days. That kinda surprised me as I had read that day 2 was the hardest of week one.   There were a couple of things different about my schedule for this run though, so I am wondering if they might have made a difference. I was hoping that you fine folk might be able to help me out and let me know if any of the following might be why I found today harder...     usually I run at night - at about 20.00-20.30ish. But today I ran early in the morning, straight after having breakfast... maybe my body didn't have the energy reserves to call on that it normally does?   I had one day off between W1D1 and W1D2, and in that day I made sure to walk 10,000 steps (I'm currently doing the 10,000 step challenge). Between W1D2 and W1D3 I had two days off and yesterday I only did 5,000 steps as I'd had a really long day at work. I know you're supposed to have rest days, but could my inactivity (compared to previous days) have impacted me today?     I'm usually a lurker, but am posting this as before today I was super confident about week two, and now I'm kinda nervous about starting week two...Summary:
Summarize: While your post brings up many important points surrounding the fight to end legal abortion, I have to respectfully disagree that banning abortion would be worse than defending its legality.   One problem leading to widespread abortion is the socially accepted belief that the child in question is not really a person, or is not deserving of the rights his or her mother possesses. My generation has been raised on this concept, as our country's law has always defended it. Therefore, in many cases, abortion is chosen over pregnancy because it is the most socially acceptable option. Personally, I have heard far too many stories of women who were pressured into abortion by someone close to them, someone who would never instruct them to do something illegal or potentially deadly. In these cases, a law against abortion could make the decision in favor of the child's life.   Also, the concept of a "safe abortion" is difficult to defend. Any pro-life argument will contain many statistics about the horrors resulting from abortions and the unsafe conditions of the clinics.   Your third paragraph is the most difficult argument. Yes, the foster programs and adoption systems are severely flawed, but this fact makes the government's financial support of Planned Parenthood even more ridiculous. If all of the time and funds in our society allocated to the destruction of life (or the argument surrounding the topic) were instead placed in social reforms to benefit the lives that already exist, at least some progress could occur.   As for the idea of a "rape clause", I am sure many would argue for such an adjustment. If, however, the law clearly stated that the baby's life has the same worth as that of a child nine months older, murder would be considered a worse crime than the original rape. And, as the old adage states, "two wrongs don't make a right". Also, even if a "rape clause" were unavoidable, approximately 1% of abortions occur because of reported rape--at least the number would be significantly lower.Summary:
Summarize: While your post brings many important points around the struggle for the ending of legal abortion, I must respectfully contradict that the prohibition of abortion would be worse than defending their legality. A problem that is too widespread abortion is the socially accepted conviction that the child is not really a person, or does not deserve the rights of his mother. My generation was raised on this concept as the law of our country has always defended. Therefore, in many cases, abortion is chosen about pregnancy because it is the most socially acceptable option. Personally, I have far too many stories of women who have been put into abortion by someone close to them under pressure, someone who would never instruct them to do anything illegal or potentially deadly. In these cases, a law against abortion could make the decision in favor of the child's life. Also, the concept of a "safe abortion" is hard to defend.
Summarize: My BM's used to be hard, compact balls of poop every 3 or four days and then (because of other reasons) I decided to do something about it: I drink water, ate yogurt(everyday for the first few weeks; then at least twice a week afterwords--worked and still works for me), ate more fiber (not too much, I've had that happen-not fun); the granola bars and cereal bars are good, coffee is my go to poop juice (sounds weird, but it is). When going to the bathroom try to get into as much as a squat position as you can, with your knees above your hips. Hope this helps. It did for me! I still eat my shitty diet but yogurt has been my best friend; it helps a lot to bring my poops to normal. (which is shitting every day at least; going 2 days to 4 days without taking a shit is not normal...at all) Also, Activia is bullshit, regular yogurt is just the same just they trick you into thinking that if you buy it your better for it. It works for any types of yogurt if you take any kind for the time I said above.   I too hated yogurt with a passion, but I needed something with probiotics to help with my IBS, and the juice I normally would buy for that was hard to come by and expensive so I thought I would give yogurt another chance. Although I wanted to start out with flavors I thought I would like so I got Apple Turnover and Peach. Suddenly I didn't hate yogurt anymore. And it helps even with lactose intolerant people because it has cultures and good bacteria in it. So even though it is dairy, it DOES help. Also, if you have a poop that is sticky and not coming out, it's not ready to come out. It has to "solidify" more. I have had this happen to me and I go later on and it comes out fine.   If your filled with soft stool, that means it's not ready to be pooped yet. I actually wondered about that too but I came to that conclusion when I would poop hours later and it would come out solid. Sometimes I would strain to get out more and then I would have soft poop up there, but it gets' sucked backed up" for lack of a better term. [Your poop doesn't sit at the edge of the anus, you have an anal canal after the rectum.]( So be assured the soft poop will go back up one you stop straining to poop that out.Summary:
Summarize: Fossil fuels play a role as well, predictably enough. Russia is the largest supplier of natural gas to Europe- about 25% of their total consumption-and more than two thirds of that runs through Ukrainian pipelines. In the past decade there have been numerous spats centered around transport fees and Ukraine's habit of stealing gas on its way to Europe, including a couple of incidents where Russian suppliers turned off the faucet entirely as retaliation. This instability upset a number of European nations who like having a reliable supply of natural gas, which is where the Middle East comes into play.   Large natural gas fields in Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and Iran threaten Russian dominance over the European gas supply, but currently there's no good way for that gas to get there. A number of pipelines have been proposed, and they all have different implications for the countries they run through, but what they all have in common is that they run through unstable places that don't like the West and that none of those places are Russia. A big part of the reason why Russia is unwilling to help with the whole Syria thing- and Middle Eastern issues in general- is that the current administrations of, instability within, and UN economic sanctions against Syria and Iran are the biggest barriers to oil supply routes from the Middle East to Europe.   Securing a stable future for the pipelines that run through Ukraine is critical to Russia's energy strategy, and while Crimea is far away from the pipelines it is a sensible strategic starting point for a much bolder attempt to reassert control over the region.

Summarize: I personally don't like the flip32 mainly because i have had a couple with hardware faults so i have needed to return them (i might have just been unlucky). The flip32 and the Naze32 are basically the same board however (from a hardware perspective) but i have never had a problem with the Naze board and i have owned 5 or 6 of them.   CC3D, Naze32 and Flip32 are all good boards if you are building a small 250 racer. None of them come with GPS which is something you will probably want on a larger quadcopter, 450 size etc. (You can buy GPS modules for them but they are not the best).   The MultiWii, Pixhawk, HK version of Pixhawk and DJI Naza are all flight controllers designed for larger multirotors. They are very reliable and very good at keeping it stable in the air. They all offer very high quality GPS assistance which i recommend for a large quadcopter. The main reason i suggested the MultiWii board is because of the price however they are all very good and i recommend any of them.     The variometer i linked above is a telemetry add on. It does not effect the flight of the aircraft (the built it barometer does that). All it does is send altitude information back to the ground / transmitter / pilot.Summary:

Summarize: Hi, kind of a small issue compared to most of other posts here, nonetheless I felt slightly annoyed and thought it was sexist.  I'm writing this on my phone, so apologies for any errors.   I was visiting my brother at the hospital earlier today.  I was sitting in a chair next to my brother chatting to him, when a female nurse comes in and asks me to get off the chair.  I asked why, she says "because the chairs are for the patient's".  Okay that's fine, however she doesn't say anything to the other women sitting next to their husband's.  She just says "they're okay" and leaves, seriously wtf.   I've been visiting my brother in hospital for the past week, and I've always sat in that chair. None of the nurses or doctor's have bothered me or anyone else about it.   I didn't make a big deal of it, since I was more concerned about my brother, who'd just had an operation.  And I'm not the type of person that likes confrontations.Summary:

Summarize: I met this guy through a social group we're in about 6 months ago, we hooked up, then 2 months later started dating. Things picked up pretty quickly. I'm different from any other girl he's dated, he feels comfortable around me, I intrigue him, I'm smarter than him (apparently).   He told me yesterday he doesn't want me to come to some events with him unless it's only his very close friends. He said he just doesn't want people talking bad about us. He also doesn't want to hurt other girls he's recently dated. He is a pretty active member of the group so a lot of people know him. I'm somewhat known, but not nearly as much as him.   We're still really fresh. He said he is still not 100% sure about me, and he said he's not convinced relationships work out. I told him it's okay, no sweat.   Is this a sign he's becoming uninterested and he's just not being straight forward? Is it a red flag? Or am I looking at this too soon?   Edit: Hooked up 3 months after we met each other, didn't talk for 2 months, then started dating. It's been 1 month since we started seeing each other several times a week. He told me he is not and does not want to be seeing anyone else, but we also haven't claimed each other as BF/GF.Summary:

Summarize: I'm typing this alone. I am in front of my computer and I am alone again.   This past week my girlfriend had stayed with me during her visit to the East coast. She recently made the decision to move to the West coast for various personal reasons (her reasons being that she became to really dislike the East coast, and she wants more physical outdoor activities).   I have been upset by this decision, and I had been hoping that after she stayed with me this week that she  may  change her mind and remain in the East coast with me. She didn't and is adamant to make the move.   This past week has been intense. I have been trying my best to show her around the East coast (I'm based out in NYC) to help her reconsider. We have had really intense intimate relations which we both enjoyed - I guess I was trying my best to woo her.   At the end of it, I feel that I have been  falling in love  with her more than she is for me. I become to realise that I am the more upset one for her leaving - and I just don't want to let her go.   Some context: We hadn't been going out for long. We 'hooked up' over 15 weeks back after a work event (we no longer worked with each other at the time), and had the most amazing intense and intimate 2 weeks together. It was amazing. But we both knew that she was to leave on a 10 week bike trip. We kept in contact, and well, things ramped down again.   When she finished her bike ride, I visited her in the West coast. It was back to the same again - but I guess this time, the focus was less on the physical side. It was another week that I felt closer to her again.   She is still jobless, and last week she came round to visit her family in the East Coast, and came by to stay with me for around the week, and it was back to where we left off effectively. Halfway through her stay, I raised the topic of us with her - what did she think about Long distance? She was very reluctant - bottom line: she wants to leave the relationship if we are not in the same location.   I can't leave NYC atm - and also, I do not want to solely leave for a city for her? But I am now scared - of her leaving me. Will I meet someone like her again? I'm even scared of thinking her to be with someone else in the future.   This week has made things a lot tougher. I live in a Studio in Manhattan, NYC - and most of my time, I do spend my time lonely. I don't have many friends - and when she left, I felt so sad. Like really sad. I don't know whether I can handle it.   Her on the otherhand, seems so blasé about it. I hate how clinical she is about this.Summary:

Summarize: First off, I'm sorry for your loss! It's very kind of you to take care of your family. :)   Second, mine isn't quite as funny, but when my grandma was really sick years back, she was doing her will, and there was suddenly all this talk about if they should include "her" in it.   I kind of just brush it off, as I was 15 at the time, and didn't think much of it.   But, the next summer while I'm with some cousins boozing, it comes out that one of my uncles has this "love child" for lack of a better term that he had with this girl while in HS.   Not nearly as funny, but I was definitely shocked. He's a big nerd, and definitely not the one I'd think would be in that situation.Summary:
Summarize: Hate to burst the bubble but I ran a glass shop that's still going, been there since the 60's in NY and we regularly purchased Indian/China hand pipes. (yuk I know, forgive me ) Unfortunately I did not have the power to make the final call on all store purchases and we had pieces from 15k to under a dollar and this was back in 2000. The owners reasoning is, "why not have people buy them from us vs the gas stations (when that is what they are going to buy anyway) and maybe we can convince em to buy better".   But I digress, the gentlemen whom we bought them from were both Indian, and had been selling them to the shop for longer than I had been alive at the time (I'm now in my mid 30's). He had told us many times in his stoned rambling (we would smoke in the boss's office) about how they (both his family and the majority of those in his town) had been blowing glass since the 30's and they made cheap touristy trinkets but changed em over to pipes in the late 60's and early 70's (due to the massive influx of hippies and Beatles fans some one prob taught em then too) and he would bring them over by the case and travel around and sell them at concerts and to gas stations and head shops. Back then you had to ask for an "under the counter deal" or know the owners of the store vs now they are in their own cases at every single one...Summary:

Thing is i wasnt going back to my normal unconscious sleep but i noticed i could set up a not so vivid at start sleep. Imagined having awesome football(soccer) skills double kicks front 10 meters high incredible accuracy etc. but at start it felt fake no clear images like i knew it wasnt a real dream. I couldnt change much during dream only at beginning as i was losing control it kept getting more and more vivid. It wasnt the only dream i had after the football 1 i had weird pitstop with cartoon people and normal people. I tried doing reality checks but i couldnt force myself into it my actually doing 1(this was at start when i had some power) it didnt feel too vivid or believable more like an idea that took life and own turnsSummary:

Summarize: Hi,   I'm trying to figure out how to best layer using a soft shell jacket. In general I get the impression that soft shells aren't particularly popular in ultralight circles, but it seems to me that a merino longsleeve and a soft shell should be able to pretty solidly cover anything down to a few degrees above freezing, and half a kilo for a jacket is a big weight improvement for me already. I have a Jack Wolfskin fleece windstopper that I've had for many years, but it's heavy and not very water resistant.   So I'm fairly set on buying a soft shell to replace this although I'm not really sure what model yet. Are there any significant differences between the manufacturers, other than fit and features? Or are they all pretty much the same in terms of warmth and water resistance? It would be nice to not have to get out the hard shell until it gets quite downpoury.   The other issue I'm concerned about is how to layer with a down jacket/vest. I ordered a Uniqlo Ultra Light down jacket for a mid layer between shirt and my hard shell, however I figure for ultimate low temperature outings, it should be possible to go for 4 layers:   merino shirt -> soft shell -> down jacket -> hard shell   My hard shell is sized to go on top as an outermost layer, but what I'm wondering about is how I should size the soft shell. Would that be better form-fitting to wear underneath the down jacket? Or does it make sense to size up the soft shell, in order to get the insulation of the down jacket as close to the body as possible?Summary:

The other question I worry about is how to get low coat / vest.
Summarize: When I was younger I was very much "rock is the only good genre, rap and country are terrible, put em together and it's crap".  I thought I was so clever and cool with my extremely singular taste in music.   Then it broadened a bit to where I didn't like just straight up electric guitar, classic rock/headbanging.  I started veering a BIT from that with The Beatles and other not SUPER rocky bands but still considered to be rock n roll I suppose.   But in 8th grade I heard T.I's Whatever You Like and Kanye West's Heartless almost every day on the bus so I got interested in hip hop.  I remember hearing Forever by Drake, Ye, Lil Wayne and Eminem and thinking it was the best thing ever.   Well eventually I was pretty much only listening to hip hop.  About two years ago I decided to pirate every Kanye West album just to see if I liked him.  That day I listened to every track on every album and absolutely fell in love.  Kanye is now 90% of what I listen to, nothing beats it, and I now own everyone of his albums (physically).  I actually own Yeezus three times, I bought it once digitally and two different friends gave it to me as a gift.Summary:

Summarize: Quick History: 3 Years Cheated on him in very beginning (before we had DTR talk) But wait..Found out he's not divorced.   Before I cheated on him, I noticed things that were.. odd. He would touch my face and start humming, or he would get so angry he was seething if a male co-worker (any of them, including my boss) spoke to me. If he heard a call get transferred from the switchboard to my phone, he was at my desk immediately. Ionce asked if I could have a night at home to myself, and was texted every few minutes asking why I was angry, what was wrong, why didn't I care about him.. I should have known...   Two months after we started hanging out after work, I went to my home state 12 hours away. I slept with my ex-fiance. After he found out, it was a new beast. No going to the gym, grocery store, or anywhere besides work without first notifying him and receiving approval. I know I made a mistake. I definitely deserved consequences. I was belittled, I was insulted, I could not have a private conversation with my parents, sisters, friends or even doctor without him in the room.   I grew pretty depressed. I really felt and still kinda feel like o deserve all of this. You all may agree I do, and if so, feel free to say it. But I'll continue.   He broke up with me several times, but he always came back. I moved for work 8 hours away. I tried to get him a job around here, but his wife (yep. no divorce like I was told) was still there. If she got a job first, he wouldn't have to pay 'maintenance on her!' he said. He never sent his result.e so I could submit it for jobs close to me, and always made an excuse why the job wasn't good enough, or an hour was too far away.   So, he continues to belittle me. I have to respond to texts within 5 minutes, or I'm getting yelled at. I can't visit family without him getting angry at me. Two and a half years after the infidelity. Finally, I got angry and yelled back .We broke up. 3 hours later, he's in the hospital with a heart attack. He receives a stent and has 3 blockages at 90%+.   Now, instead of yelling, he is needy without the anger. I still have to respond within 5 minutes of receiving a text. I can't work past 5. He cries before I go to see my family. He cries if I'm not paying to go see him once a month, even though he has only been here once in what is now two years of me living here and I paid for that trip. Guys.. he won't let me shave..down there. And asks for picture proof that I haven't.   What have I done? I feel like I'm going to die like this. I have no friends anymore.

I didn't commit myself, he wasn't divorced. Before I cheated on him, I noticed things that were.. strange. He would touch my face and start humming, or he would be so angry, he was something when a male employee (each of them, including my boss) talked to me. When he heard that a call was transferred from the switchboard to my phone, he was at my desk right away. I once asked if I could have a night at home at myself, and was getting angry every few minutes with the question why I was, what was wrong, why didn't I take care of him.. I would know... Two months after we started hanging out after work, I went away to my home state 12 hours. I slept with my ex-fiance and I always felt a great time. I did not have a new beast.
Sometimes I didn’t realize that a coworker was talking to me. Sometimes he told me he was going to give me a phone call.

Two months after we started working, I would go home 12 hours away. I slept with my ex-fiator.

So no, they are not equal, because one accepts that women need to be brought to the same level as men for equality to be achieved whilst the other believes that both need to be shuffled around and is usually spouted by people who think that women getting lower sentences in court comes down to feminism and not patriarchal attitudes (For example)Summary:

Summarize: Another title that was on my mind for this is "Are we thinking about the concept of god the wrong way?". I'm a weak atheist, I like to maintain an open mind. Therefore, I'd say my belief isn't that god absolutely does not exist, rather one probably doesn't. I do, however, believe that God the way religion describes Him absolutely does not exist. There is no Being that created the universe in 7 days and women from the rib of a one man, duh. That way of describing a god is what I think we're all talking about when we say we're atheists. However, I do admit that we, with our limited intelligence and even more limited senses and instruments with which to gather empirical evidence, would be arrogant to say god cannot exist in some form or another. Maybe one day we'll have accumulated enough knowledge and advanced technology sufficiently to be able to notice a god's or gods' presence. Maybe that/those god(s) will be a collectively conscience hyper advanced alien organism.   When I think about the ideas proposed by quantum physics, string theory, M theory, etc. that posit that there is infinitely many universes, that there may be a universe out there that is exactly similar to ours, that there's another  you  out there (but that maybe has shorter hair or something), I can't help but to think that maybe there's also universes out there where religion's God does exist. If there's an infinite amount of universes, even ones where the laws of physics are slightly different, then there could be one where magic is real, miracles happen, and the Earth is only 6000 years old. Talking about this seems pretty irrelevant to us here in this universe but bear with my for a little. Here I'm supposing that god is within infinity rather than outside of it. God (the religious one) exists in some universes but not others, and, of course, definitely not ours. But I think this is the wrong idea of god. Religion's God in this sense sounds more like an advanced alien organism that is able to affect the laws of physics of that universe creating, as we do ant farms, earths for lower beings to live and worship the god.   Here's what I think god is: it's not a being that does things, it is infinity itself. Maybe even something much higher than that. Here something more stumps me: if we were to suppose that there is an infinity that contains all other infinities then what contains that infinity? Maybe this is why Cantor went mad.   Another neat idea is one that I read in Scott Adam's story (yea, the writer of Dilbert, now shut up and let me write)  God's Debris: A Thought Experiment  we'll eventually accumulate all the knowledge there is to accumulate. Of course the idea that knowledge is finite is another point for debate, and one that by, having supposed it, it may seem that I have already contradicted myself having said the universe is infinite. I mention the finiteness of knowledge because, in a way, science states that one of its goals is to find that one equation that will explain all the forces of nature. And having done that, it is only a matter of study until all is known. Also, knowledge doubles every year, this means eventually the rate of accumulation of knowledge will eventually reach infinity. So even if there's an infinite amount of knowledge, we will be able to accumulate it all at an infinitely fast pace.   Maybe I'm crazy, or went off on a rant, and in some points made no sense, but at least we all agree that religion's God does not exist and is primarily a tool used by authorities to keep their power over the masses and to individuals as a way to calm their nerves from the fear of death and nothingness. So back to my original title: I'm no mathematician but, in thinking of god as the Infinity, can we come to some sort of conclusion that would answer the questions: "what contains the Infinity that contains all other infinities?". Is that God?   I tried to spew out so many ideas that are swirling around in my mind that I'm sure I contradicted myself and left out other ideas that would have helped make more sense of it all. This of course is just a problem with language itself. We cannot possibly express the complex thoughts we have in our minds into a limited, linear system of symbols. One day I hope we'll be able to communicate telepathically with thoughtful imagery. Then we'll hopefully succeed in squashing misunderstandings. Now, back to playing Diablo =)Summary:

Summarize: If you really don’t care that much about decade-old problems, you should start reading this at the fourth paragraph . The first thing that needs to be taken into account is that this is not a problem limited to 1998-2002. Origins could be traced back all to way back to WWII, but leaving excruciating details aside, the fact is that Argentinean economics after WWII were heavily conditioned by inflation. From 1945 onwards, inflation would reach peaks of up to 113% annually, with an average of 25% from 1945-71, and up to 60% the following years.   This situation was of course worsened by the military dictatorships’ policies, in addition to the economic crisis of 1980, as well as the Falklands war. The last dictatorship fell in 1983 due to (you guessed it!) economic hardship and the first democratic president, Raúl Alfonsín, was elected. He implemented a plan to change the currency by removing zeros and changing its name to the “Austral”, in addition to other structural reforms. To get an idea of the currency’s constant loss of value: by 1945, 4 Argentinean pesos could be exchanged for 1 USD, then by 1985, 1 new Austral was worth 1 billion pesos (1 USD ≈ 1 Austral = 1,000,000,000 m$n).   This “Austral” plan of course failed miserably, since it did nothing to really change the underlying problem of inflation. The Austral started off almost at parity with the US dollar in 1985, but by 1990 you would need 10,000 Australes to buy one dollar, and the percentage of inflation was measured in the thousands. Unsurprisingly, Alfonsín was promptly sacked.   After that, Carlos Menem is elected president and this is when things begin to take shape to create the scenario for the crisis. Menem was a diehard neoliberal heavily influenced by the principles of the Washington consensus. One of the most notable acts of the Menem administration was the privatization of many state owned companies such as Entel or Aerolineas Argentinas, and subsequently companies linked to TV, railways, oil and gas. Also, he dismantled many regulations on the economy such as quotas, duty taxes, restrictions on imports and controlled prices. Lastly, in an attempt to stop hyperinflation, he implemented something that translated roughly to “Convertibility Law”. This law would strictly tie the national currency to the US dollar, and subsequently created a new currency (once again…) called the “Peso convertible”.   From this point on, the exchange rate could not fluctuate; it was a fixed 1 dollar for 1 peso. This obviously meant that the central bank had to guarantee with its own reserves that each peso could be exchanged for a dollar or for its value in gold. This would later turn out to be too heavy of a burden for the government to bear, but for the first years it did drastically stop inflation. Also, Argentina’s GDP began to grow steadily for the first half of the 90’s, although growth was not homogenously distributed among different economic sectors.  Some sectors were heavily damaged and unemployment began to be more and more a growing concern. At the end, the legacy of the Menem administration was a huge government budget deficit of 7 billion pesos, an equally huge foreign debt of 145 billion and a burden on the central bank to maintain the Convertibility Law.   So after Menem failed to change the constitution in order to be elected for the 3rd consecutive time, Fernando de la Rúa was elected as the new president in 1999… and this is when shit really starts to go down. The foreign debt was proving to be too big of a burden and it was adding to the already huge government budget deficit. Many big banks were heavily invested in the national government, so there was an increasing fear that the government could default. This fear was exponentially bigger within the general population whose savings were in those banks whose solvency depended on the government being able to pay its debts. So after a failed attempt to calm the market down by injecting 40 billion dollars and by postponing payments farther in the future,  the public finally panicked . People started to massively withdraw their money from banks, 5 billion US dollars worth of deposits were lost from January to March 2001.   The government then tried to negotiate a package of 29.5 billion dollars with the IMF and some private banks in an attempt to reduce the burden of the foreign debt. However, as it is tradition with the IMF, they only agreed to the package if the Argentinean government implemented unpopular measures that were basically a big fuck-you to its citizens. At the end this served for close to nothing and capital outflow and recession continued at a staggering pace.   At this point, the government imposed heavy restrictions which would later be called  “El Corralito”  or little “corral”. For those of you who don’t know what a corral is, it’s [this]( An enclosed space in which livestock is kept,  a very appropriate term .   The Corralito consisted on restrictions, both on financial entities and common people, as a last resort to stop deposit outflow and to discourage speculation that the “Convertibility Law” would be dismantled. These restrictions were very harsh; people could only get access to $250 a week, even if you had tens of thousands in your account and had many expenses. So of course this sudden restriction of liquidity halted all economic activity: it paralyzed commerce, froze credit, people and companies could not make payments to other people or companies who subsequently also couldn’t make payments. Ultimately, this created such civil unrest that de la Rúa was deposed.   Then Rodriguez Saá assumed the presidency for two weeks, in which he declared that the government would default, the biggest default in history. However, he refused to leave the Convertibility Law, reason for which he was deposed. Eduardo Duhalde then took office, and the first thing he did was to dismantle the Convertibility Law and to turn all credit to Pesos. With the Convertibility Law, the peso was fixed at one dollar, so even if you could only access $250 a week, theoretically the money you had in the bank would not lose its value. However, after the Law was waived, a new exchange rate was established: 1 USD = 1.40 Pesos. This literary meant that people lost tons of money overnight. However, debt owed to the financial system would still be paid at 1 USD = 1 Peso, this was called “asymmetric pesification”. And then finally, after the damage was done, the end of “The Corralito” was announced in December 2002. The Supreme Court backed the government’s “pesification” at $1.40 for every dollar, plus inflation, and a 4% annual interest rate. At the end, after the deposits were freed, the final result was around 3 pesos for every dollar. So yeah… many people got fucked over.   I understand that I left out many things, like the IMF constant meddling, cold war relations, the Mexican crisis of 1994, military dictatorships, etc. But this turned out pretty long as it is; it’s very hard to properly explain this without writing an actual paper on it.  So please cut me some slack.Summary:

Summarize: Never posted before, using throwaway, posting from mobile.   Until recently I was in a 4 year LDR with a wonderful girl I loved very much. Everything was fine until she got this new job about a year ago. It's a very demanding and consuming job, she had to move away from friends and family and live alone for it. Brutal hours, and impossible to take more than a couple days off at a time until, as she put it, she "works for several years to earn that much time off". She no longer had any time for me, and we had a fight. We didn't speak for two weeks, not even a text, and at that point I decided enough was enough. She had put zero effort in for a long while and that was the last straw. I ended things via text (our timezones/her work schedule made calling very difficult) and she read them but never replied. I figured she'd never talk to me again.   Over the last year of my LDR I became close with a female coworker, but it was strictly friendship. I'll call her Jen. My ex was the jealous type and I knew it'd upset her so I never told her. I even never hung out with this girl outside of work until my relationship ended. I found out very quickly that Jen wasn't looking for a relationship, but did want to be friends with benefits. Aside from all of that she's also just a fantastic friend, and helped me to deal with my breakup in alot of ways.   6 weeks after breaking off with my ex, she texts me. She admitted she ignored our problems and neglected me, and realized her mistake after so many weeks of no contact. She said she missed me, her best friend, and said she didn't want to lose me as part of her life. She also said that maybe we could talk out our problems. I believe everything she said to be true.   Later that same day, Jen invited me to come over to her place for sex later in the week (she's always been very upfront) and being single I of course said yes. I find Jen extremely attractive sexually, and am a virgin to boot, which she likes apparently (my LDR was sexually starved. Despite 4 years, we hadn't seen each other since she left for home and we never went all the way before that). Jen knows I had contact with my ex, but pointed out that I'm single and free to do as I please.   Having talked to my ex over a few days it became clear that despite breaking up we still held strong feelings for each other. I told her about the dates I tried to go on and she said it was fine because we are not a couple... but eventually I got her to admit that, yes, it did bother her. She also thought that my talking about these girls, especially my new friendship with Jen (of which she is extremely jealous), meant I wasn't interested in being with her again. I told her I'd be willing to give it a shot, but only if she made some big changes or it could never work. She said she would seriously think about it.   Now the fuckup. Last night I got drunk with the boys and stupidly decided to tell my ex I had sex since we broke up. It was a lie, but I wanted to know how she would react and if, despite what she said about not being a couple, it bothered her. I wanted to know what I was to her. And also, I did still have a fuck date with Jen lined up. Would she be okay with her now single ex fucking someone else? I wanted to know how she really felt.   So I tell her this, and she says "she suspected the whole time" (despite it never happening..) and assumed it was Jen. She became upset and I, still drunk, decided that I should tell her the truth, that I'm still a virgin. Figured it'd make her feel better, whoops on my part. She got (rightfully) pissed that I was lying. I fucked that up, and she's thinking about what to do with me.   I need advice. I can see myself having a future with my ex, I adore her and it could work if she's willing to make changes. But it is by no means certain that she will, even before I upset her when I was drunk. I'm asking for big changes she wasn't willing to make originally. Jen on the other hand isn't sure if she wants a relationship right now but does want to fuck around. If I decide to ignore the fuck request, it will likely offend Jen and possibly ruin an amazing friendship. But if I go through with it and my ex decides to give it another shot, then it would probably break her heart despite us not being a couple when it happened. Worst case is to not do it, and my ex decides not to try again, ruining both relationships. I'm going to see Jen tomorrow.   I need advice.Summary:

Summarize: Why is post-grunge so hated?   Hoo boy, a whole variety of reasons...     Yarling (i.e. copying Eddy Vedder's/Hootie and the Blowfish's/Alice in Chains' vocals), or generally "unimpressive" vocalists     Watering down original grunge without knowing what grunge was about (I've often said grunge = punk + new wave + indie + stoner rock + doom metal + '70s heavy rock with healthy servings of traditional metal, post-punk, and noise rock; post-grunge seems to have or know none of this)     "Comfort food" or "corporate" rock made for radio or anime music videos on YouTube     Four chord progression     Bare riffs     No/weak guitar solos     "whiny" breakdowns or lyrical matter     Predictable song structure (the "intro-verse-chorus-verse-chorus-breakdown-chorus-end" formula)       It's hit or miss with a lot of people. Hardcore fans of grunge (Subpop and Mainstream), metal, old school hard rock, punk rock/hardcore punk, original alt rock, indie rock (classic and modern), and classic rock will indeed crucify you for mentioning it anywhere near their bands; metal (mostly heavy/thrash/death/doom/symphonic/prog metal, and minus alternative and nü metal) and classic rock hate it pretty fervently, but the grungers? Oh... Oh shit, you shouldn't even  say  names like "Puddle of Mudd" or "Three Days Grace" around a hardcore grunge fan. Back in 2010 when I kinda, sorta liked Three Days Grace, I made that mistake. Boy, I done fuck't up. Fucked. Up.   Fans of post-hardcore, metalcore, emo rock, J-rock, and pop punk (the "AMV genres", I call it) are probably where you'll see the most peers who agree with the tastes. As well as pop listeners, since most post-grunge bands were radio-friendly enough to gain a lot of pop/pop rock fans. Even my mother, who pretty much hates hard rock, likes many post-grunge tracks. But as soon as you cross over into alternative bands like Smashing Pumpkins, Breeders, Sonic Youth, Tool, or (surprisingly) Korn, all hell starts breaking loose.   I personally, have no problem with it. It's just not my thing, but I never felt any sort of vitriol towards it either. That said, being a massive fan of stoner/doom metal, I've been studying rock history long enough to know  why  post-grunge (and nü metal, seeing as you mentioned Staind) gets so much flack. Stuff like this happens to genres that get too big and overstay their welcome. It happened to progressive rock, hair metal, and others. The reason why it happens to these and not others (why post-grunge and not grunge) is because of its "authenticity." Grunge, punk, heavy metal? Came out of nowhere. The original bands mixed many influences together and created their own thing, and made music that wasn't really radio friendly but  forced  radio to conform to them. Their follow ups conformed to radio. Likewise, they developed large fanbases, but earned the scorn of the 'original' or 'pure' scene.   Wanna test it out? Try mentioning any pop punk band (or punk band that achieved pop status) near fans of The Damned, Black Flag, The Mob, or External Menace.Summary:

I would much rather you call me than slit your wrists.  But when I'm holding the knife, I don't call, I don't send frantic text messages, I get my head together and put the knife down myself.  And I always have.  I will always, always be there for you and try to help you help yourself to put the knife down, and I will always always tell you why you're important to everyone you know.  But don't get angry when I fail to tell you about my life.  If you don't ask me how I'm feeling, why should I tell?   I know I wasn't a stellar girlfriend.  I had anxiety and depression problems that I was working through, and it must have been hard for you to hear that I didn't want to do certain things because someone had attempted to sexually assault me recently.  And I'm grateful that you had the appearance of patience.  But all I ever asked was for a hug and a respect for my boundaries, not limitless emotional support.   I  had to be stronger than  you  to resist your advances.  And I am so, so, ecstatically happy without you.  Because I don't need somebody who can't keep control of himself.  And I don't sit here wishing you were suffering, or pining over you.  I just don't care.  I care in the sense I'm glad you're gone.  Beyond that, I don't give one.   But the two months I dated him, I didn't talk to you, you epick gamer.  I was clearly out of my mind, because I was dating a total jerk.   You were quiet and sweet and you're hilarious when you open up.  And we tell each other about our demons, and we sit with each other even when it's hard to hang on, game together when the rest of the world seemed hopeless, and I feel terrible because my anxiety got in the way of me being a better friend.  You told me I was pretty.  You know my insides better than anyone, and you're my best friend, and I'm terrified of pushing into your life because I know your demons keep you shut up and I might only make thing worse.  You are the single person who's been there for me whenever, ever since I met you.  And heaven forbid you find any of this because my head may be filling in the blanks, and I may not mean anything to you at all.  And I'm sure if I asked for help, I could have it.  But I don't want to ask you, because you mean the world to me and I don't want to push, especially since my anxiety must have pressured you so much in the first place.  And I guess now it makes sense why you didn't want to tell me about your problems, because maybe you feel the same way.  But what do I know.  I overthink stuff.   I am still working hard to be better, to be faster, to be smarter, to be everything more than I already am.  And I get tired and just want to be me at the end of the day, but the rest of the world doesn't want that.  They want the selfless girl who doesn't sleep so she can keep you from committing suicide, the studious girl with an impeccable transcript (that I'm never going to have), the musician who can pull on your heartstrings, the daughter who can get everything done, the girl who can whip time out of thin air to make everybody happy.  And sure, maybe that's what you think I am.  But I'm not that, and trying to cram 30 hours of work into a 24 hour day is killing me, and most of you aren't happy with what I'm doing anyways because it's not enough for you.   I can't stand the rest of you.  Your apathetic, vapid, transient, people-are-bubble-gum-wrappers nature disgusts me.  I'll bake for you and sit with you and tell you how wonderful you are, and then you'll say "gee thanks" and leave me by the side of the road.  Because when it comes down to it, I'm not a person, I'm a tool for you to use to get back on your feet, and you don't want to deal with me when I'm not helping you.  People die.  People hurt.  People aim to kill.  I can and will take all of that on my own because the rest of you don't have the maturity to sit with me when I need to be human and be scared for ten bloody seconds.   So I'm just going to keep fighting.  Because if I stop, I'll get overwhelmed and probably have a mental breakdown or something else funsies.Summary:

Summarize: For my own personal accomplishment? Sophomore year in high school I auditioned and made my high schools nationally competing show choir. I was super excited and pumped until I found out I was a swing. This meant I was almost like half a member and only was allowed to participate in half the competition show.   I worked hard and made the best of my situation, I worked on my coordination and vocals and one day a kid dropped out.   He was in the front row so I immediately was shot up to the front and the pressure was on. The entire competition season I worked harder than I ever had just to impress my peers and show my director that he made the correct choice in letting me fill the spot.   The hardest thing to learn? Tap dancing has a pretty steep learning curve. I would go home and practice filaps and shuffle-ball chains around my house. It drove my parents insane.   Now it was time for nationals in Nashville, TN on the Grand Ole Opry Stage. I gave it my all and through hard work and dedication I was able to over come the talent gap and I was the only guy to win Most Dynamic Performer as a sophomore out of all the competing show choirs at the competition.   Best memory of my life.Summary:

I worked hard and did the best of my situation, I worked on my coordination and voice and one day a child retired. He was in the first row so I was immediately shot in front and the pressure was on. The whole competition season I worked harder than ever to impress my peers and show my director that he made the right choice to let me fill the place. The hardest thing to learn?

Summarize: I HIT MY GOAL! :) This is my first post so be easy on me. Progress Album (Before and After) -   A little background:  My entire life I've been that really tall, lanky, skeleton looking dude. I have also been pretty athletic, preferring cardio and endurance sports. In high school my max weight was 125lbs. I never starved myself or had any eating disorders, my dad even took me to a doctor who gave me a clean bill of health. I have always been able to eat what I want, when I want and NEVER gain anything. In fact in high school I remember watching that movie "Super Size Me" and seeing that guy eat fast food for a month and gain some serious weight...I tried it. Gained nothing and only felt sick and sluggish. Fast forward to after high school. I started working out(no workout plan, I'd lift basic dumbbells and do cardio) and put on my first 5 lbs, but between full-time work and college I stopped working out. After stopping I noticed I retained that 5 lbs, so I would workout once a year and gain another 5 lbs. That got me to 140lbs. I am now 22 years old.   Recently I got fed up with being skinny and forced myself to do some research to fix it. I bought me some protein and started to ACTUALLY work out. I set a high goal of being 160 by June 13th. From my start date of March 13th that would give me 3 Months(13 weeks) to achieve my goal.   Workout Routine :  Basic meaning the normal workouts I see everyone doing(Bench, Squat, Calf raises, Bicep curls, etc) Monday - Basic Upper Body. Max weight. Tuesday - Basic Lower Body. Max weight. Wednesday - Core and Back. Heavy weight but high reps. Thursday - I hit upper body HARD doing drop sets until I burned out. Friday - Misc day. I would hit everything that felt rested. Saturday - Rest/Sports Sunday - Rest   Diet : Admittedly this is my week point, something I have JUST started working on as hard as my workouts. Thank you /r fitness For the first 2 months I only added 1-2 protein shakes a day(usually 1) and a lot of fast food(living situation prevented cooking) attempting to choose "healthier" fast food when I could(ie: Subway). This seemed to work VERY well as I was gaining, on average, 2lbs a week. However at 155lbs I hit a plateau. I went a couple weeks without gaining anything!  Then I moved out and got access to a kitchen!  During the last month I added 2 protein shakes a day and started cooking basic protein meals with rice and vegetables. Essentially pan-grilled chicken or fish, rice(mostly flavored rice), and a mix of frozen veggies. I also forced myself to eat 3-4 meals a day.\ An average day looked like this :  Breakfast - 2 Waffles with peanut butter. Daily protein shake Lunch - a medium portion of a protein meal listed above. 2nd Lunch - a medium portion of a protein meal. Post workout protein shake Dinner - a BIG portion of a protein meal.   Well on June 15th(2 days after the intended date, I know) I weighed in at 161 lbs! This has been a huge moment in my life because weight gain has been SUCH A GOD DAMN STRUGGLE for me. I am very proud of my progress and I really wanted to share it with you guys!   Currently I still weigh 160 lbs, my strength is increasing but my weight has plateaued again. I am going to start cracking down on my diet to see if I cant get it increasing again. I WELCOME any advice you guys can give me for weight gain.   Please tell me what you think and feel free to ask any questions! :)Summary:
I did what I wanted, I was always able to eat what I wanted, when I wanted and I didn't make anything. In fact, in high school, I remember seeing this movie "Super Size Me" and seeing this guy eat fast for a month and take some serious weight... I tried. I didn't win anything and I felt sick and mower. I started working during the year I started working for another period of work, I had another goal.

I remember that the movie "Super Size Me" and see that guy eat fast food for a month and some heavy weight... I've tried it. Nothing and just felt sick and sloppy. Quickly after high school stop. I started out after work (no training plan, I raise basic dodging and do cardio) and put on my first 5 pounds of work, but between full-time and college I've been sick and sloppy.

Summarize: Hello! I do apologize for this moderately off topic situation. I suppose I need help brainstorming! The other night, I went out with a couple of my close friends. As the night progressed, the couple of friends turned into a fairly larger group of people hanging out together, and these people are all people that my SO and I are both friends with. I kept debating whether or not I should invite him all night. I just feared that it was late and I didn't want to keep him out. Really and truly I know how awful that decision was.   I've had guilt on back log for three days now, just because I know I hurt him by not inviting him. He invites me to everything he does. This was my chance to return the favor and I failed. He had spent the day buying me the most wonderful and thoughtful birthday gifts, and it seems as though I couldn't shed a thought of consideration in return. So that was the backstory.   I decided that in order to make up for this awful, awful thing I did, I was going to gather all of our friends up to go out to eat tomorrow night. I wanted to keep this a surprise for my SO. I figured it would be really nice, and if it goes through, he will feel as though he is very loved by his friends, as he's always been a little insecure.   I was texting people last night to try and organize this, and I accidentally let out a bit of elation in front of my SO when I was getting good signs from the people. So I told him I had a surprise. He is not one for surprises! He gets incredibly curious and intuitive and tries his best to figure out what the surprise is in advance. He knows I am not getting him a material gift, so I am certain he is on to me.   My problem is this. I am slightly scared that the plans will fall through tomorrow. I am going to do everything I can to make sure they don't, however I am just a little bit nervous. If these plans fall through, I need to come up with something in place of the gathering so that he doesn't feel unloved by his friends. I know lying to him is absolutely no good, but if he finds out that his friends bailed, I will make him feel even worse to begin with. Could you guys please help me think of a back up surprise just in the remarkably slight chance things don't go through? Thank you so much for taking the time to read all of this and helping me.Summary:
Summarize: This is by far the weirdest I've ever had AND heard of...   I walk into my backyard from my house and circuit a roundabout created by our above-ground pool to get to the shed. My (now ex) girlfriend's dog is sitting in a shallow tray and rotating at an alarming speed. It barks a few times and I continue walking the circuit.   I see my ex, completely naked except that her naughty bits are covered by a thick layer of straggly black fur. She's sitting in a pool of mud and dragging her ass across it like a dog with her legs in the air. I get mad at her and tell her to get dressed, to which she replies 'He's only making me get dressed because (blank) is here'. She disappears and I mount the stairs to the pool.   Now, I don't know if anyone remembers this, but there was this weird girl on youtube a few years back, her videos were just her, staring at the camera and doing nothing. I only ever watched like, 1 joke reaction video to her. Apparently it stuck with me though. That girl shows up and is dressed in a geisha costume, face paint and all. As a testament to how completely random this dream was, this is her only appearance.   All of the sudden there are lots of people there and they are chanting for a mutual friend of me and the ex's to do 'the reactor thing'. He jumps in the pool with a ball and starts spinning in the center of it, not moving the water or anything, but just kind of chilling. Next thing I know there are bubble versions of random shapes scribing an orbit around this guy, some of them operated by other random people and some of them just free-floating.   A bubble chair hits me in the back of the head and when I look up again, everything is gone except there is an entire marching band in the pool. They all start walking toward the audience and play a final tune. Some of them go down on one knee, presumably to asphyxiate underwater. An announcer says 'And that was the brentwood marching band. How about a round of applause!'   And I'm the only one clapping.Summary:
Summarize: As we're all waiting patiently for the expansion cards to show up to shake the meta up a bit, I wanted to show the redditors some decks of my own creation (one for each class) to expand on the current meta. I'll show one now together with some basics and if it gets enough interest I'll post another one each week.   The first deck is the [Wall of Flesh]( deck.   This is a deck which I used to climb to rank 6 back in September and then levitated around 8-6 before I took a break from HS on the 15th. It's an anti-aggro control heavy mage deck which makes use of the Naxx Class Card "Duplicate" by effectively shutting down the enemies' board with, well "Walls of Flesh" (Abominations, Sludge Belchers, you get the point).   The decklist isn't set in stone and a couple of cards can be exchanged for different things.   The Ragnaros Slot: That is the finisher slot for the deck, effectively being the deck's lategame, it can be exchanged with either Pyroblast, Archmage Antonidas or even Malygos (Prefferably with Ysera)   The 2nd Flamestrike Slot/2nd Polymorph Slot/TBK slot: They are the control slots of the deck and, depending on the matchups you're facing, can be switched out for things like Harrison/Loatheb/Ysera/Baron Geddon or Pyroblast (if it's not in the Rag Slot)   Basic tips:   1.Always try to mulligan for a mana wyrm/mirror image, but if you get a 2 drop like frostbolt or mad scientist in your hand, keep them. If you have coin you can keep Water Elemental in hand too, especially against hero enabling classes (Basically everyone but Warlock, Priest and Mage)     Don't be afraid to Duplicate your Mirror Images against classes with low AoE removal (e.g. Warrior or Zoo), but don't throw them out as soon as they duplicate into your hand, use them as tactical damage prevention if you get them.     Health is just a resource, so don't get scared of dropping Abomination's or Baron Geddon down on the board if it means wiping the board or using Arcane intellect for card draw if your opponent has some damage on the board.     If an enemy has a hefty board of 3+ health minions on turn 6 and you have both blizzard and flamestrike, don't save your blizzard, use it to prevent damage and to bait your opponent into building his board up for the flamestrike       Matchups - ordering from most favorable to least favorable       Aggro Warrior - The most favorable matchup for the deck. Even though Aggro Warrior is mostly in the early 20's-15's, they pop up further down the ladder on occasion. They have a hard time going through all the taunt walls and run out of steam pretty quickly. If you get a good early curve they will most likely lose. Keep their heavy hitters down and save your polymorphs for 5+ health minions since everything else can just be killed via frostbolts/aboms or blizzard.         Shaman - Shaman is yet another easy matchup and is one of the 3 decks/reasons as to why I built the deck. Current Shaman mostly revolves around comboing his cards into tons of burst damage with a hefty board. The biggest plus is the fact that most of his minions are 1-3 HP minions and the deck handles those the best. The shaman also doesn't get much benefit from Lightning Storm against WoF and will not be able to handle it after the 2 hexes get played out.         Zoo Warlock - If there's one class that butcher's it's health more than you do it's Warlock. Zoo creatures are mostly high value minions, but seeing as the meta changed to more deathrattle aggro, that has switched around which has made it easier to sweep Zoo off the floor. Zoo usually doesn't run Silences in their decks (a random Owl might appear in every 10 decks) which makes it that much harder for them to go through Abominations or Sludge Belchers. Control their board early game and try mulliganing for Frostbolts. Your mid-game control strength will be able to handle their Lategame minions which will leave Zoo dry. If possible try to set blizzards up by activating haunted creepers before turn 6+.         Hunter - It's a bit less favored than against the other decks if they run explosive trap because you're on a shorter clock than other people due to the abominations, but since the traps have mostly been Snake/Freezing during the past month. You can hero power their early game whilst keeping the pressure up with mana wyrms, mirror images and mad scientists. Save your polymorphs for their Highmanes and keep all beasts off the board to prevent Houndmaster Synergy. Most of their minions are low-health so your AoE should be able to handle the board if things get too out of control. Water Elemental is crucial in this matchup to prevent their bow damage.         Rogue - Both Backspace and Miracle can struggle against the deck, but in Miracle's case the early draw will decide the game 60% of the time. Backspace got killed by the addition of Sludge Belchers to the game in general, but they can still  be a threat if they get ideal draws. Miracles' Strength Lies in its' removal. Once they go through both Eviscerates and Saps and you have a taunt on board with a good chunk of HP, which is the most likely scenario due to the pressure deck can pump out, they're dead in the water. P.S. Flamestriking a single concealed auctioneer on board is not a dennis move in this case.         Priest - This matchup tends to be a stalemate which gets broken down on who draws better/worse. Usually it'll go down to fatigue unless you have Ysera/Malygos in your decks to counter their removal. The key to the matchup is Killing their Mind Control with the Counterspell if possible or protecting any of your Lategame with it. If they get a good early curve they can spiral out of control if they play their cards well.         Handlock - We've gotten to the Trio of the most unfavorable matchups for this deck. Handlocks constant High HP minion tossing engine makes it hard for WoF to punch through and do something. If the Handlock is smart and plays his minions procedurally instead of flodding the board with them, he'll be able to pull out a win, otherwise you might pull it out by chunking his board with AoE control whilst protecting your face from the abnormally high burst damage turns from the Handlock player. Jarraxus is the card you don't want to see because you will have a hard time handling a 6/6 minion Each turn unless your rag/ysera survived or you have 15 damage still in hand (Pyro + any damage spell). The Warlocks self-mutilation might work to your advantage, but don't focus on his health, rather focus on his giants and drakes, once you get rid of them, you're golden. Selectively use your polymorphs and use your AoE control/damage when he has 2 or more of the beforementioned minions. If he makes the mistake of taunting one of those creatures up and you have a Black Knight, you're golden. If you can pull off a good earlygame you'll be able to pull out a win.         Control Warrior - The 2nd face of the Devil. Mages are known to have problems handling Warriors due to the Mage's limited amount of damage and the Warriors absurd amounts of "Healing"(Shielding). Baiting out a Brawl with low cost minions is your #1 priority. Polymorphs priority if you have anything on board is as follows: 1. Sylvannas, 2. Ysera, 3. Rag, 4. Grommash, 5. Cairne. All your spells should be used to wear out the Warrior's threats because getting through their Armor is pointless, you can use them on their face if you're afraid of a high damage shield slam landing on one of your minions.         Freeze Mage - The Devil Incarnate. Board control doesn't do much since they don't play many minions. Double Ice Block is a problem because lategame, Freeze Mage effectively has 24 mana to kill your HP, if you manage to Counter Spell one your chances of winning will increase exponentially. Alexstrasza is your biggest enemy, but also your trigger to place counterspell down because you know what's coming. Antonidas is your number one Kill Priority, then Rag, then Alexstrasza.         Control Paladin - Don't even talk about this... EVER. The amounts of Board control, Healing and Board presence just outright destroy your earlygame. You have to play very carefully and prepare for anything on every turn. The amount of Healing that the deck does is preposterous and every single game will last up until the last card.Summary:

The first cover is the [Wall of Flesh] (tack) that makes use of the Naxx Class Card “Duplicated” by effectively closing the enemy board with, either “Walls of Flesh” (Abominations, Sludge Belchers, you get the point of sale of the slot). The deck table does not stand up and a couple of points of hand sales can also be exchanged for different things.
Summarize: Hi. I'm a mid level player (~70 cb) who just learned to flick in the past two months (i can flick 100% if i concentrate now :D )   I learned thanks to slayer creatures like trolls and dragons having annoying melee attacks that i could negate completely with a little more effort.   Prayer switching, similar to prayer flicking, is another skill at the core of osrs's complex mechanics. Jagex intentionally designs their higher level boss fights with prayer switching in mind, the same with some higher level monsters. (Dragons for instance.)   My problem is this: The earliest time prayer flicking became useful to me was when i unlocked 43 prayer. However for prayer switching, it has been at around 9 combat levels later at green dragons. And the reaction time i have (with terrible latency ~350 or so) for green dragons is too little to make it worth the effort. I'm better timing a melee flick for green dragons every time than risking a mage flick for dragonbreath and potentially spoiling my timing for the next melee that comes along.   My proposed solution is this:   Give some lower-mid level  slayer  monsters a dragon styled 'power attack' (barely more powerful works imo, think the extra wind up would give it the same dps as several regular attacks, perhaps with the same or less accuracy additonally)  with  very forgiving  timing, slowly ramping up the reaction speed needed as you progress through higher slayer levels.  The reason it's slayer monsters is so people expect a challenge when fighting these creatures, you expect something more interesting than your standard rmb fare.   This would     Create a learning curve for this skill, letting more casual players acquire the skill to face jad far more easily than the current system     Create a more interesting, challenging combat experience than right clicking that troll once and tapping stayin' alive with my index finger on a sword picture.     Fuckin help me out man jad is hard with this ping jesus(and make the barrier to becoming woox achievable for people like me less daunting)     I don't actually have much game knowledge though, so idk if this already exists or not. If it does it's surely not as obvious as it could be.   What do you guys think? I want to nut out everything we can about this idea til we have the best version, or dismiss it as garbage ( ;[ )Summary:

The commutation of prayer, similar to the prayer flicker, is another skill at the heart of the complex osrs mechanics.

Summarize: You don't need to use it, but a repository makes installing things a lot easier. If you install an application from the repository you are garanteed a few things: it works, it uses as little disk space as possible, you get security updates, it will be accessible to all users on the system and it will be easy to remove the application later.   In Windows there is an installer which works in all versions of Windows and every application has a copy of every dll it needs budled with it. In Linux there are a lot of different installers and the libraries, which are like dlls, are installed seperately. This makes every application which needs the library able to use the same copy. The result of this is that SteamOS takes less than 5 gb of disk space, while Windows 7 takes over 25 gb.   The reason it's harder to install software in Linux is that every distro gas different versions of libraries, which may not be compatible with one another. There are also multiple different installer formats, which only work on specific distributions. Debian, SteamOS, Ubuntu and Mint use deb packages. That doesn't mean you can install a deb package for Ubuntu on SteamOS, though.   Recompiling applications usually solves the problem with different library versions, but not all software is open source. Canonical, Valve, Gnome, Red Hat and SUSE. Are currently all trying to invent cross distro installable packages in different eays, but it's proving to be a hard problem to solve.Summary:

Summarize: Below is a copy of [this post]( by /u/2095conash on Sun Sep 21 21:16:05 2014 UTC, as read on Sun Sep 21 21:16:24 2014 UTC.     I've seen various times people talk about how the men's rights movement is against equality due to them not understanding what we're saying. Obviously there are a bunch of people that straw-man us, or refuse to listen to us, but there's nothing that we can do about that. What we can do however is choose our words so that we don't confuse people who DO take the time to listen to us to prevent them from thinking that we believe that the random equality supporting person who identifies as a feminist, no matter how misguided they may be, are the people we, as a movement, fight.   One of the biggest problems that we have with arguing against feminism is if you would, people 'pull out' the dictionary, whether this tactic is logically valid or not doesn't change that it gets to the core of one of our biggest misunderstandings, what WE mean when we say 'feminism' is MUCH different than what most people mean when they say feminism. It doesn't matter which is 'right' because with this big communication gap we can't even BEGIN to discuss who is right. It's like, if we assume all apples are red, if they believe that 'purple' means red (so they think apples are purple), and we believe that 'green' means red (so we think apples are green), we argue that green is the best color in the world, they argue that purple is the best color in the world, but because we aren't communicating properly it isn't revealed that we're BOTH saying that red is the best color. I recognize how the metaphor does not mirror this situation, it was merely to demonstrate the difficulties that arise from two parties that don't understand what the other is saying due to a lack of communication.   Now, we can't really expect them to start clarifying their statements since one of the reasons for our general conflict with 'feminists' (as individuals) is because both sides generally write away the other side's definition as something that doesn't matter. From what I've seen, they do it because they think that ours isn't real, it's wrong, or whatever, and we do it because 100 people sitting around at computers talking about how equality is good don't matter even 1/10th as much as someone getting an anti-equality law passed. So if we want to be able to communicate and be better understood, the burden is on us really as the side the acknowledges both definitions. Now, I recognize that we have used terms like 'radical feminist', but I don't think that is clear enough, because that suggests that some teenage girl who wants to kill all men who no one listens to is who we're upset about, rather than someone who is heard and talks about how men shouldn't hit women (instead of people shouldn't hit people, which does include men shouldn't hit women so such a discussion isn't anti-equality but is misguided).   I personally think that we should start using terms LIKE (feel free to suggest alternatives) 'ideological feminist' and 'movement feminist'. In this we'd be against 'movement feminists' or 'movement feminism', the people who have and use the power of the movement, the money of the movement, the image of the movement, or such. While 'ideological' feminists would be more of the type who have opinions, and maybe they talk about them, but they aren't really 'big', they don't have a 'wide scale' effect (while masses of ideologicals DO have a 'wide impact' on the image, money, or other resources of the movement, I generally feel that those are the sorta things that every individual of every movement contributes a tiny percent of those merely by having the label). I know that there are many of you here who are of the belief that feminism is built upon inherently sexist beliefs, so don't think that I'm saying that all ideological feminists are pro-equality but recognizing there are a lot of moderate ideological feminists is something that we can do to have people listen to us about the radical movement feminists, and at the end of the day, it's those radical movement feminists that lead to children having 'the glass ceiling', 'the pay gap', and all sorts of those things beaten into them with no alternate view. The major problem when our only clarifying terms are 'radical' and 'moderate' are that the moderates think the radicals are only ideological feminists, when a disproportionate amount of movement feminists are radical. Obviously you can further clarify by using both radical/moderate and ideological/movement together, but I recognize that's a bit of a slippery slope to much longer identifiers....   But those are just my thoughts, what do you all think? Anyone have any better suggestions for the terms? Any arguments against 'clarifying' what we're saying by adding one or two words here and there?   I apologize for my verbose nature and if any of you feel this thread to have been a waste of your time. I thank you very much for your time and hope you have a nice day!Summary:

Summarize: I'm a little over 7 months pregnant and after a long and frustrating confrontation with a crotchety old neighbor telling me that I am not allowed to park in my own parking space because it is inconvenient for him when he has guests I was emotional and upset and decided to give into the urge and run into McDonald's and grab a breakfast before work.   When I walked up to the counter to pick up my bag of food the cashier (a 50ish year old hill billy looking woman with barely a handful of teeth) reached across the counter and put her hand behind the bag of food i was holding and rubbed my belly and asked if it was a boy or a girl.   I am usually pretty good in the moment and able to react to things quickly but i have never been more surprised or speechless in my life. I wish i could say i gave her a witty response, put her in her place and made her rethink touching people she has never ever met before.   I didn't... I said "its a boy" as i ran out of the restaurant so fast i didn't get a straw for my orange juice. Been kicking myself about it for days, if there is a next time I am going to steal your idea!Summary:

So, now our boyfriend is basically being given the ultimatum by his boyfriend. He's forcing him to choose between us. This is the one major thing I've been afraid of the entire time we've been dating, because there is no question about who my boyfriend will choose. He will choose his boyfriend, not me.   So, r/polyamory, what do I do? Do I hope that somehow this will all work out? Or do I cut and run, since I'm not sure that even if we managed to patch this all up that I could ever trust that I have some measure of security, or that there's any chance I'd be allowed to see my boyfriend? I feel like their relationship is unhealthy, and have for a while. My head's telling me to leave this hot mess, but my heart's been in love with this man for two years now.   Any advice?Summary:

Summarize: Hi RBN! Long time reader, first time submitter here.   I am looking for some advice on an incident that arose yesterday. This is a long one- sorry in advance!   Some background info: My fiancé and I have been together going on 11 years. He is the only child of a single parent- NMom. About 5 years ago he had had enough of the abuse. His NMom had escalated an inane issue (we can't remember about what) into a complete meltdown. He went complete no contact for about a year. Since then, we have had extremely low contact with her. This has not been without effort and we both work very hard maintaining boundaries.   Upon initially getting engaged earlier this year, it has become increasingly difficult to wrangle her behavior/control our interaction and our amount of contact has been increased for obvious reasons. Now that she has decided that my family and I are "already her family," she has since lashed out at my mother and I a few times. She started spinning out of control for a while. Whatever. We can handle it.   A lot of her erratic behavior is hard to keep a bead on and has led to some difficulties over the years since she is aging (mid 70s) and lives in another state. There will be panicking/wailing voicemails left over "emergencies" (think stubbed toe level). But, refusal of information about major health issues and true emergencies. For example, we did not know she needed a heart valve replacement until basically right before her surgery. She would coyly tell us she had a "major health issue" for months. But then just refuse to tell us anything. Literally- no other information. It is extremely hard to judge what is really going on with her.   My fiancé has a job where he has a very odd schedule. It's rotating, sometimes 24 shifts, sometimes business hours, sometimes overnight, a week on/week off- you get the idea. When he is gone, we normally communicate over text. She does not care for the fact that he cannot answer her calls at her... beck and call? But he will always answer texts.   He missed a text from her to call her a few days as ago. Which brings us to last night. All of a sudden, he started receiving multiple calls from a number in his mother's state and received a voicemail. It ended up being his mother's boyfriend who left an incredibly chastising and condescending message that my fiancé should call his mother because of a health issue and he doesn't understand why he "doesn't seem to ever have time for his mother."   In my haste, I suggested he give his mom a call right away because it seemed like a real emergency situation. He calls to find out his mother "may" have had a minor stroke... over 2 weeks ago... I listen in about 25 minutes of round about explanations of events, hedging around info on vital questions (my fiancé used to be a paramedic) and then another 10/15 minutes of his mother complaining that I'm not "warm and fuzzy." I'm already over the fact that she's verbalized being upset with me for months now. Because most normal 29 year old women should enjoy being continuously "pet" like an animal at their engagement parties...   Immediately after the phone call we had 2 major concerns:   My immediate concern was that I jumped the shark. Thinking an emergency was happening then and there and urged my fiancé to call his mother right away. I did not even consider the fact that it will most definitely get back to NMom that her random boyfriend will let her know that he initiated a reaction and was the catalyst to the frantic call. I am concerned that she will now try to use him in the future as her extended arm to put pressure on my fiancé. I feel so horrible about this by the way. I feel like a jerk to do this to him and blindsided that I didn't see this coming.   My fiancé was angry and upset. This man is not a step-father or anything of the sort to my fiancé. He does not know the history between NMom and fiancé, other than what she may/may not have told him. And they started dating after we were already very low contact. He is basically a stranger. We do not know him at all- whether he is an enabler or a passing guest in her life. And we both find it extremely offensive and inappropriate that he left an authoritative, chastising message for a 35 year old man that he barely knows.   My fiancé then explained to me that he is concerned that all the hard work we have established over many years may be destroyed; creating boundaries and keeping low contact is going to come crumbling around us. This man overtly disapproves of the low contact situation. He made that abundantly clear in this message. And my fiancé is worried that this will only lead to enabling. Or, as he said it, "putting a bug in my mom's ear that this isn't "right" and I shouldn't be treating her this way." Which is the only ammunition she will need to start harassing him, me and my family again. That very minor prodding will open floodgates tantamount to the elevator scene in The Shining.   My fiancé is not a worrier- that is my job in the relationship :)   The fact he is concerned at all is a huge red flag of the reality this may happen. He is usually never wrong about situations like this.   We're not sure how, exactly to handle this moving forward and I suggested I post here for advice.   I suggested he call NMom's BF and somehow let it be known that his opine on the status of my fiancé and his mother was completely out of line. He is in agreement.   Or, should we let this episode slide?   We're also at a loss of how to approach/verbalized this.   To reiterate: although this man has been dating NMOM for a few years, he remains a stranger to us. It is unanimous that my fiancé is not in any way obligated to disclose the reason for the nature of the low contact relationship- nor does he want to. We also know very little of the picture she has painted of him.   We may be reading this completely wrong. But, we both feel that now we have to establish boundaries with this guy. And that's something that needs to be handled with a phone call back to him. But, with nondisclosure, keeping things short and to the point- how do we do this?   What can my fiancé say to make it clear there is a reason the relationship is as it it? And that is none of the BF's business? Without sounding like a complete asshole? Or having unsavory info leaked to NMom?Summary:
Summariz: Hello RBN! Long-time reader, first time presenter here. I am looking for some advice on an incident that arose yesterday. This is a long one-I feel it in advance! Background information: My fiancé and I have been together for 11 years. He is the only son of a single father- NMom. About 5 years ago he had had enough abuse. His NMom had escalated an inan problem (we cannot remember what) into a complete collapse. He did not get in full contact for about a year. Since then, we have had extremely low contact with her. This has not been effortless and we both worked very hard maintaining the limits. By starting to get involved earlier this year, it has made it increasingly difficult to count on his behavior/control our interaction and our amount of contact has increased for obvious reasons. Now that she has decided that my family and I are "on the edge of her family" have brought us an example of health.
Summarize: If this is not the place to ask about this, sorry.   I've been suffering from severe lack of motivation to do a lot of things. I'm a university student(I still go to class and do assignments though). Its just the "small" things I'm skipping. I haven't done laundry in weeks, and I find my self easily skipping meals (I have no body image issues though, perfectly happy with way I look). I also just don't go out and "do things" either. Today, all I had to eat was a scone and some chocolate (although I'll probably eat something for dinner soon), and I sat infornt of my computer for about 10 hours streigh. It scared me, so I decided to ask the internet for help. (Because thats always a good idea).   I feel very guilty when I make mistakes (big ones, not small one though), to the point of instead of trying to deal with it and do what I have to do, I'll just not deal with it. At all. And I'll feel miserable because I feel so guilty. I don't know if I have a problem, or am just shit at dealing with life. Any and all helpSummary:

Summarize: My boyfriend's best friend was diagnosed in April and began immunotherapy, but we recently found out that it wasn't working.  When my boyfriend was telling me this, I could tell he was devastated.  My boyfriend isn't a negative person, more of a realist, but he's convinced that chemotherapy isn't going to work and it's going to take a miracle for his friend to beat this. After he told me the news he was silent for a moment, then quickly changed the subject to something else and we haven't really talked much about it since, aside from him telling me he talked to his friend or he hung out with his friend.  No details on if his friend has decided to do chemo or not.   I understand people deal with things like this in their own way.  I know when I'm dealing with something heavy I tend to internalize before I'm ready to talk.  I don't want to push him to talk about it if he's not ready, but I know he can't bottle this up.  How do I let him know it's ok to talk to me with out him feeling like I'm pressuring him?Summary:

Now, I didn't start dating her only for her looks... but her losing weight has drastically changed her personality for the worse.

Summarize: yoooo fam.  So I'm growing my hair out to be pretty long and I'm in a pretty awkward stage of length now! It just looks super 'moppy' at the moment.  The bangs are about to my nose, and the side just lays over my ears, not quite to ponytail length (Which is the basic goal).  So my question to you guys is, what the fuck can I do with my hair to make it look better?  I just push it to the bangs to the side so its not straight down!  Thank you!Summary:
Summarize: Quite honestly, I feel at a loss. I feel kind of mad. Not at keto. Maybe at myself.   For a month I kept at this new lifestyle. Tons of leafy greens with my meals full of fat and proteins. Carbs counted for less than 20 g/day. Growing up in an Asian family, I've received my fair share of criticism for refusing rice at the table--but that's 45 g of carb per bowl I can't afford. My family always throws away the fat off the meat, so I've received a bit of criticism for eating that as well.   But I powered through that for 30 straight days. Survived through the keto flu. Shot for 1200 calories/day. No condiments. Slip-ups would never exceed past 1500 calories (which truthfully happened 4 or 5 times). Ran 4 miles once a week. 40 oz of water everyday.   I've miserably refused favourite snacks, desserts, and foods I've once desperately loved. I skipped out on cake on my brother's birthday. Turned down all the fancy little cakes, tarts, and sweets at the dessert bar of some fancy birthday banquet. I've ignored a pantry full of crackers and biscuits, a freezer full of ice cream, and a fridge full of fruit. While my family indulged on ice cream bars at night, I sipped water and nibbled on a handful of raw almonds and 90% chocolate.   30th day. I weighed myself. It was the same as my starting weight. At first I felt okay. I started this change for a healthier me anyways, right? But I slowly grew bitter throughout the day because really I did this so I could lose weight in a healthy way. Now it's been brought up that my lifestyle hasn't been worth it. "How the hell could you lose weight eating so much fat anyways?" I feel like I let down keto by being an example of failure. I believed in the science so much that I wanted to prove that it works.   The pressures of mentally calorie counting for the past 30 days finally reached its breaking point and I fell back into old binging habits. I probably consumed double, if not triple, my daily caloric intake yesterday. Carb/calorie counting went to hell.   I don't even know what went wrong. I almost feel like carb counting doesn't even matter. Or calorie counting. I feel completely stuck at this weight. I have no energy. I feel hungry most times. Arguably, slipping 300 calories over 4-5 times has impeded my weight loss, but I've tried losing weight through calorie counting without carb-counting and have at LEAST lost 5 pounds in 30 days. [freedieting calorie calculator]( claims I need 1329 calories/day for weight loss, 1600 for maintenance, and 1088 for extreme fat loss.  Should I be opting for 1000 cal/day?   Just because someone will ask, a sample meal plan:   Breakfast: > * 2 boiled eggs (160 cal, 2 g net carb)     2 strips of uncured bacon (70 cal, 0 g net carb)   2 oz. chicken breast (70 cal, 0 g net carb)   1 tbsp of bacon fat (115 cal, 0 g net carb)^♥   1 cup green-leaf lettuce (5 cal, 0.5 g net carb)  420 cal, 2.5 g net carb     Lunch: > * 2 oz. beef (145 cal, 0 g net carb)     3 mushrooms (12 cal, 1.2 g net carb)   1/2 cup onion (35 cal, 7 g net carb)   2 oz. chicken breast (70 cal, 0 g net carb)   1 egg (80 cal, 0 g net carb)  342 cal, 8.2 g net carb     Dinner: > * 1 egg (80 cal, 1 g net carb)     2 strips of uncured bacon (70 cal, 0 g net carb)   2 oz. chicken breast (70 cal, 0 g net carb)^♦   1 cup organic baby spring mix (7 cal, 0.7 g net carb)  227 cal, 1.7 g net carb     Snacks: > * 1/8 square Lindt 90% Dark Chocolate (30 cal, 1.5 g net carb)     1 oz. raw almonds (170 cal, 3 g net carb)  200 cal, 4.5 g net carb     TOTAL: 1189 cal, 16.9 g net carb   Notes:   ♥ Cooked in bacon fat yielded by bacon   ♦ Was not cooked together with the bacon in its fatSummary:
Summarize: I recently made huge progress with my consistency just by setting up few rules for myself. I started playing ONLY AK-47 and M4A4 on buy rounds. I've never used Aug/SG anyway, but I did sometimes try to AWP, get a scout on a force buy or an autosniper when I had 16k$. On force buys (only once or twice per game) I get Famas/Galil and whenever I can't afford one of those I just get a pistol, never a shotgun, SMG or any scopes rifle. So as I now had an AK/M4 most of the time I sat down, learnt those two spray patterns by heart and told myself to ALWAYS spray with the exception places of Long A on D2 or Yard on Nuke. I used to think I was decent at tapping, but in reality half of my games I was doing fine but the other half I was sitting on three frags blaming my mouse, warm up, practice and whatever what lead me to wasting hours on headshot only servers trying to become ScreaM who I clearly wasn't. Being able to control your spray (more or less) until the last bullet may not make you any quicker, but it gurantees you the kill at some point. And on MG rank where I'm currently playing, it's not about how fast you flick but if you manage to get a total of 100 damage before reloading. Being able to consistently secure all "easy kill" like people showing you your back and even being able to spray down two or three at once consostently is already pretty good. Aside from that knowing I can kill everyone at some point (unlike before where i tapped 10 shots doing 0dmg, sprayed another 10 bullets above his head and then switched in panic to my pistol just to reset the recoil while i still had 10 bullets left in my assault rifle) is also a huge confidence boost. I actually stopped playing DM and doing any sort of warm up altogether yet still am far more consistent than before. Only thing I do is practice my sprays during the 3 mins warmup peroid before any comp match. :)Summary:
I started playing ONLY AK-47 and M4A4 on buying rounds. I never used Aug/SG anyway, but I sometimes tried AWP, getting a scout on a strength buy or a autosniper when I had $16k. On force buys (once or twice per game) I get Famas/Galil and every time I can't afford one of those I just had a gun, never a rifle, SMG or a shotgun. So, as I now had an AK/M4 most of the time I sat down, I learned these two models of heart spraying and I told ALWAYS to spray with the exceptional places of Long A on D2 or Yard on Nuke. I thought I wasn't decent to kick a little further, but actually half of my games I was doing well, but the other half I was sitting on three frigs blaxing my mouse, I was not getting any warmer than I was doing three times and I was doing three times more than I was doing that.
I haven't even started with Aug/SG yet, but sometimes I have tried to buy AWP, a scout on a force or a car niper when I had 16k$. Buying on force (only one or twice per game) I get Famas/Galil and whenever I can't afford one of which I only have a gun, never a shotgun, SMG or all rifles rifle. As I now had an AK/M4 most of the time I sat down, learned the two half of the damage from my heart and told me that I spray again and again with the exception of places from Long A to D2 or Yard on Nuke. I used to think I was decent at taping, but in reality half of my games I was good at typing, but the other half I log on three questions blaming my mouse, warm up and what also lead me to spray on headmant servers.
I started playing only AK-47 and M4A4 in the shopping rounds. I never used Aug/SG anyway, but sometimes I tried AWP, getting a scout at a force purchase or autosniper when I had 16k$. In the power purchases (only once or twice per game) I noticed those two patterns of heart spraying and told myself that ALWAYS sprayed with the Long A exception locations at D2 or Yard at Nuke. So I thought it was decent at the hit, but actually half of my games was doing well, but the other half was still sitting at three charging points the same way as the Long A game at D2 or Yard at Nuke. Actually, I thought it was decent at the hit, but actually half of my games was doing well, but in case most of the load points were the same way you didn’t make it much easier.
Summarize: My boss does this crap all the time.  He gets payed 30 grand a year to provide desktop support and a further 40 to do app dev work (which he doesn't do at all), but has gotten into the position where a few of us part time students can do all that work for him.  Needless to say, we don't cover all hours of the day (which he does and is responsible for)... and are on extremely restricted schedules due to school.  He has no idea what is actually going on with desktop support and constantly hounds us about tickets that were closed hours before because he doesn't actually click the refresh button.  Lately he has been taking off 9+ days a month to "work from home" where he occasionally sends messages to us about work we've already done to feel like he's still in control.  He also goes swimming for an hour or two every day and attends meetings that have nothing to do with his job most of the rest of the time.  <3 bosses.Summary:

Summarize: I'm sure you're just trying to simplify things for the OP but I'm a big fan of throwing people in the deep end to help them truly understand.   > Valuing a bond is straightforward.   Very far from reality! For a start, what's your discount rate? How do you determine a discount rate? Do you base it off a fixed rate (and how do you determine this - what is comparable?), or do you you use the known yield curve (say for T-bonds, which isn't even that comparable) each day to discount on different rates? How do you model default risk? Do you do this in-house or rely on third parties? Then you've got step-up notes, convertible notes, different preference conditions, floating rate notes which all require unique modelling considerations and judgement.   > the price you're going to pay for a bond is based almost solely on the discounted cash flows you will receive from the bond.   Once again, far from it. One only needs to look at the value of exchange traded notes to see how the value is far from the DCF. If things are bad in the company, you could see a note trading at $15 for $100 par.Summary:

Summarize: Hey,   I'm a traveler from R/Photography. Photography is my utmost passion in life, and I am certain it will be my life career. In recent years, I have stumbled on, and became fascinated by, the set photographer, also known as the unit still photographers. USP's take the images used for marketing the film (or TV show/commercial, as the case may be).   Do you guys ever use SP/USP's? If so, what advice would you give me? I understand we are typically disliked, and "fly on the wall" is VERY important. Currently, I am in my third semester at community college (but first semester as a matriculated freshman) studying Photography Technology. Next Fall I hope to transfer to the School of Visual Arts in New York City. SVA's photography program is one of the best in the world. I hope to eventually get my MFA in photography from this school.   In addition to schooling, I am currently shooting theater. This feels similar to what SP work will be. Accurate? So far I've only shot a single show, but I'm ready to shoot more. I understand that becoming a union full-time set photographer is very challenging. To this end I have quite a few connections in the New York City theater/film world. I am in limited correspondence with a prominent set photographer (won't give the name for his privacy. You know the movies he's worked on). 6 or 7 months ago he told me to shoot more related material and get back to him. Once I shoot another theater performance I'm going to recontact him.   That was ridiculously long. How am I doing?Summary:
Summarize: afgeneral31 :  ^^original ^^reddit ^^link     First off, I feel I need to state this before I continue. This is not about what Phil stated or anything that has to do with the content of his beliefs. It is what he did that I care about.   If you are like me, you are probably tired of seeing beards on everything. Uncle Si, funny as he may be, can become somewhat of an eyesore when he is promoting everything. From the T-shirts at Wal-Mart, to bobbleheads, to anything else that the family has their image on, it can be overwhelming. If you haven’t seen it yet, there is a Chia Pet Si and a Chia Pet Willie. Heck, I saw a picture of Si on the side of a trailer that was called the “Si Pad.” So they put their name on merchandise and sell it. That’s their business. If you want to buy it, that’s your prerogative. If you watch the show, I don’t care. I have watched a few episodes and found it quite different than the usual filth that is broadcast to our homes.   When Phil made his statement, there is no doubt it was a trap. I don’t know who set up the interview with GQ but if you tell me that you did not see this coming, you are an idiot. With that in mind, Phil still stated his beliefs anyway despite the contract he signed with A&amp;E, despite what any corporate lackey told him to say, and despite any money that was involved. He did not change who he was regardless of how much money he was paid. Another situation that the show faced was when they pray over a meal at the end. Phil and the Robertson clan have kept their prayers on the show no matter what the media tried to pressure on them. There were threats to take the show off the air, cancel contracts, or even lessen the amount of money the show made.   Phil, and the rest of Robertson family have not compromised their beliefs or themselves because of any money or threats from the media. The media must know that the Robertsons are untouchable in terms of money. They don’t need any! The problem the media is facing now is how to control them. But that’s the thing, they can’t. Money is all they got to go on. The ratings will be there because of the show’s popularity. The media is scared because there is no way to control them. They will continue their own lives despite what money has been earned (T-Shirts, duck calls, etc.). That’s different because of the lovely examples we see on Reddit with the shills and fake accounts trying to sway public opinion. There are still some people on this planet whose values mean more to them than money. You can look at any of the news stations and see exactly what their political beliefs are. There is propaganda amuck on the internet and TV thanks to the bill repealed recently.Summary:

Summarize: Hi all,   I'll try to make this as brief as possible since it's rather a long story and you all don't want to be reading massive walls of text.   I'm 23, currently on holidays in Europe with my best friends, having just beat cancer, graduated top of my class and received a job-offer with an amazing staring salary. I should be on top of the world.   Here I sit, however, unable to smile or be happy or really care about anything. It all stems from a girl I had dated for six years. We broke up at the beginning of this year after an awful Christmas together (her breaking up with me, over the phone). Since this, I have set /r/GetMotivated as my home-page, I've followed all of the advice - lost 1/7th of my body-weight through exercise daily, got really good (for me) results in my exams this year, graduated top of the class, tried to accomplish everything I thought might help me to move on and any advice I thought might help that I read on this subreddit. I've spoke to friends at length about my situation (they are sick of hearing about it!) and family too. Even tried counselling when I was briefly diagnosed with cancer just after the break-up. It wasn't for me (neither the cancer nor the counselling!).   I just can't move on though.   All I can do is check her Twitter, Facebook every so often. Even today, while sitting in the private pool of our hotel, surrounded by friends, when I got a call saying I had this amazing job offer, I feigned a smile, laughed and pretended to be happy. Deep down all I could think was "Yeah, this is all you've worked towards, all your accomplishable goals accomplished now - but at the end of the day, all you want is her, and not even accomplishing all these goals has brought you one step closer to the happiness she gave you".   What can I do to get over this guys? I've tried everything - gym, talking to people, counselling, diving into study, taking up new hobbies - hell, I'm even moving to another city next week for my job. I can't muster up any enthusiasm or encouragement anymore though. I am just broken.   I'm really, really sad. I don't think I am depressed - I still do things, get out of bed, feign interest and enthusiasm sometimes. Sometimes I am even genuinely happy for brief periods, but mostly I do things out of habit and hope they will improve how I see things.   So far, however, and in fact,Summary:
I do what I did, I do what I did, I do what I did, I do what I did, I do what I did, I do what I did, I do what I did, I do what I did, I do what I did, I do what I did, I do what I did, I do what I did, I do what I did, I do what I did, I do what I did, I do what I did, I do what I did, I do what I did, I do what I did, I do what I did, I do what I did, I do what I did, I do what I did, I do what I did, I do what I did, I do what I did, I do what I did, I do what I did, I do what I did, I do what I did, I do what I did, I do what I did, I do what I did.
I'm as short as possible since it's rather a long story and you all don't want to read massive walls of text.

Summarize: Sorry I am going to hijack the top comment.   Could someone please explain to me why Comcast and Time Warner Cable are not already violating US antitrust laws?   (I pulled the italicized comments from the Wikipedia antitrust page here: [   Preventing collusion and cartels that act in restraint of trade is an essential task of antitrust law.   Some practices are deemed by the courts to be so obviously detrimental that they are categorized as being automatically unlawful, or illegal per se.   * The simplest and central case of this is price fixing. This involves an agreement by businesses to set the price or consideration of a good or service which they buy or sell from others at a specific level. (Consideration is the concept of legal value in connection with contracts. It is anything of value promised to another when making a contract.)   The consideration in this sense is the service level that the ISP provides; things like bandwidth, connection speed, hardware, access to the infrastructure, etc. This is the service that they provide in exchange for your money, stipulated in a contract between you and the ISP. Now our antitrust laws make this specifically clear that price fixing does not only apply to the  price  of the service, but also the  value  of service provided. I will get into sources if necessary, but it is obvious that the service that we receive for the price is  far  below what could be provided. This can be shown conclusively anywhere from Google Fiber to South Korea. Not to mention failing to upgrade infrastructure with taxpayer money, unnecessary data caps, maliciously forging packets to disrupt p2p sharing (this has the same effect as throttling bandwidth for certain sites, they are deliberately using technology to interfere with access speeds), they throttled VoIP, they routinely bill customers for spurious charges and returned equipment, they spend millions of dollars lobbying against the consumer,  and employ the spouses, sons and daughters of mayors, councilmen, commissioners, and other officials to assure its continued preferred market allocations.   Oh, and that’s just Comcast.   * Dividing territories (also market division) is an agreement by two companies to stay out of each other's way and reduce competition in the agreed-upon territories. The process known as geographic market allocation is one of several anti-competitive practices outlawed under United States antitrust laws.   I don’t even think we need to talk about this one.Summary:

Summarize: I'm trying to be healthier and the biggest impediment in my quest is my stupid impulsivity. I have a history of binge/purge (awesome!) so my relationship with food is tenuous at best, but again and again I watch myself do things like:     Walk out of the grocery/drugstore with a bag of gummi worms   Click the unhealthy option on the takeout menu   Buy ice cream because I happen to be passing by     And then five minutes later I look at my (mostly-eaten) choices like "Wtf?! Where was my brain?!?!" I work out enough that this isn't a huge problem, which I think is also part of the problem - no sense of urgency or "real" need. I eat for the experience, I eat when I'm stressed, and I eat when I have nothing else to do, and the feeling that I don't have control over any of these reactions is really frustrating.Summary:

Summarize: In Missouri you do not provide anything about CHL/CCW if you don't have it with you. I've been pulled over once (rolled through a stopsign), told the officer where the gun was, told him I would need to get in there to get insurance (he was out and to my car before I could reach in and close it again). He asked me if it was my car and if it was my gun and when I said yes he asked if I had a permit to conceal it. I said yes sir I do and he said "But you know you don't need that permit to keep it in your car in Missouri" and I said yes sir I knew that too. At this point he asked me to step out around the other side of the car so I did. He took the pistol and insurance for the remainder of the stop and had me get back in the car to sit. He came back to my window and asked me why I had the gun. I explained I carry it for the protection of myself and my friends/family and he said "Very good. Just curious. It's a good gun." It's a Glock 17 and that's what the LEOs here are all issued. He handed me back my license and insurance and said if he is allowed access, he would like to place the pistol in the back floorboard. So I unlocked the door and said that's fine. He then gave me a warning to make sure I come to a complete stop at stop signs. I was pretty nervous with it being the third time I've ever been pulled over and the first time with a pistol.Summary:
He asked me if it was my car and if it was my gun and when I said yes, he asked me if I had a permit to hide it.

I once ran over (rolled through a stop sign), told the officer where the gun was, told him that I had to come in there to get an insurance policy (he was outside and to my car before I could reach it again and close it). He asked me if it was my car and if it was my gun and when I said yes, he asked me if I had a permit to hide it. I said yes, sir, I do it and he said, "But you know that you don't need this permit to hold it in your car in Missouri," and I said, yes, sir, I knew that too. At this point he asked me to kick the other side of the car, so I did. He took the gun and insurance for the rest of the stop and let me sit back in the car. He came back to my window and asked me why I had the gun. I did it for the protection of my family and he said that the gun and he did well.
Summarize: My husband just started telecommuting and we live in Cali.  We actually like the area we live in, but we're tired of the high cost of living and with 2 little kids getting ready to start grade school soon, we're concerned about California's deficit and cost cuts to public education.  Because we can move anywhere with my husband's job, we're looking at Oregon.  We've always wanted to live in the Pacific Northwest.  We've lived in areas that are foggy and rainy most of the time on the Central Coast and actually love it, so I'm not concerned about the weather.  In fact my husband gets migraine headaches with too much exposure to sunlight.  Anyway, I was wondering in regards to schools and general quality of life for a family of 4, is it better to live in one of the suburbs or outlying areas such as Beaverton or Vancouver, or are we better off in the city.  We've lived in relatively low population areas for the past few years, so I have some misgivings about living right in the middle of a big city, but I keep hearing how great Portland urban life is.  Just an FYI, children are 2 and 4 years old, so I will need a good preschool as well.  My husband and I are liberal leaning atheists.Summary:

Summarize: I know I'm late to this now but I want to comment anyway.  It was when I was about 15 and I ended up telling my dad I hated him.  We had been arguing several times a week for quite a while and this time seriously set me off.  We were arguing about some yard work or something and it got to the point where I was tearing up and just wanted to be alone. So I ran inside, all while my dad is following and still yelling at me, and I said to go away, we'll talk when we're not mad. He is literally 2 inches from my sobbing face, sitting in the corner of my room still screaming and I finally looked up and said those three words. I hate you. It crushed him and myself as soon as the words left my mouth. I'm actually kind of tearing up now thinking about it. He left me alone until later that night when he sat down and calmly talked to me.  I knew my dad had an abusive childhood but I didn't know how bad. He tells me how my grandfather has never said "I love you" in the 45 years he has been alive. Not once. And how he was hugged for the first time by him recently during a rough patch in my parents marriage.  Anyways, we hugged it out and told him I didn't mean it, I just wanted him to leave me alone.   This was years and years ago but I still wish I never said it.  My parents are now in the middle of a divorce so my dad moved in with my grandfather to take care of him through his battle with cancer. It's really brought that side of the family closer together which is really nice to see. Grandpa is on the way to full recovery but I cannot say the same about the divorce. That shit's still going down.Summary:
