Summarize: Hi Reddit, Yesterday around dinner time my doorbell rang and I answered to find a young man I did not know at my door. He was a young, Caucasian male wearing tattered red jeans and a tattered short sleeved red vest. He was not wearing socks or shoes and did not have any possessions with him. When I opened the door he asked me if he could come in and talk for a few minutes. I was alone (young woman) and told him I did not feel comfortable letting him come inside. As I was shutting the door he dropped to his knees and began to cry and said 'please, I'm begging you. Can I just have a glass of water and a pair of socks?' I went ahead and got him water and socks and he cried and hugged and profusely thanked me. At this point I began to realize this kid needed some help. I sat outside my door with him and talked for an hour or so with him. He disclosed to me that he was a 16 year old from Houston who had run away. He said that he had left to follow the teachings of Ghandi and the Beatles and had over the months given away all of his possessions to people who needed them more than he. All in all, really a sweet kid but I was seriously concerned about not only his safety but also his mental health. When I told him I had to leave to go babysit he told me he would be waiting at my apartment building (campus area) for an hour or so because some girl was going to meet him there. When I left I called the police and reported him as a runaway in hopes that they would reunite him with his family. Now it's been 24 hours and I can't get this kid out of my head. Do you all happen to know if there is some way I can follow up with the police on his status? Or is there some public registry of runaways so that maybe I could at least contact his parents and let them know that I saw him?Summary:

Summarize: My ex and I were together for a little under 2 years - he was my first boyfriend and our relationship was serious. We were semi-long distance (3 hour drive away) and I was going to eventually move down to him to close the distance. We even had talks of getting married. I was interviewing for jobs in his city but I ended up getting a very good offer in my city that I took (I was on a temp. contract that was going to expire in a few months and I felt like it was the best choice for myself at the time). This meant another year of long distance at least. We weren't perfect. He didn't have much of a filter and his jokes often hurt my feelings. He would tell me that he thought my friends were hot and that he wanted to sleep with them - he would say that I was fat, would tell me that his friend wanted to have sex with me etc. I would cry at least once a week because of his crude words.. I tried to break up with him numerous times but we always ended up getting back together within hours. I was not very nice to him - at times, I would tell him that I deserved better and that I hated him. I remember he once told me that he took his jokes too far but I was straight up mean to him. Our relationship was like a rollercoaster. At times, I would feel so happy and loved and the next minute I would feel depressed and lonely. He was never good at communicating with me. Every time we got into an argument or even a serious discussion about our relationship, he chose to stay quiet and pretend things were fine.. this in turn made me feel even more emotional and made me feel like he was brushing off my feelings and didn’t care. I feel like I was very invested in the relationship. Every second weekend I would hop onto the bus and go down to see him in his city. I spoiled him with affection and gifts. I made him my priority and was always on stand-by for his phone calls.. he was dedicated but not very at the same time. He called me everyday but always right before bed. I remember being sad because he would always want to go to sleep after 5 minutes on the phone with me while I had been looking forward to talking to him the whole day. We skyped/video called maybe less than 10 times. He told me he hated talking on the phone but that was all we had going for us.. He always had something else he wanted to do whether it’d be playing games, going out with his friends and etc. He only met my friends twice. I remembered buying at least three tickets to events with me and my friends and he would always back out last minute. In the end, I always told my friends that I was tired and wanted to stay in to cover up for him. He also never prepared any gifts for special occasions in advance for me. His gifts were always last minute (the day before or the day of.. or even 2 months after) and I feel like he only got them for me because he knew I would be sad. In the heat of the moment 6 months ago, I broke up with him. This was two weeks after I accepted the job in my city and also weeks after I found out that he did cocaine at the beginning of our relationship. I felt blindsighted that he decided to drop this big bomb about doing cocaine when the entire time he acted like he was completely against drugs. At the time he also decided to start a MLM company which I did not support. I remember feeling like I didnt even know who he was anymore. At this point, my reason for breaking up with him was because our values and goals were not lining up. I tried to talk to him that night about the insecurities I had about our relationship and where it was heading. He kept brushing me off and saying that we were fine and then just straight up changing the subject. At that point, I had had enough and I broke up with him. Not one hour later, he went to the bar and met a new girl who he started dating the next day but he told me to give him time to think about us. I felt gutted. He even told me that I was just one of the 30 girls he slept with but this new girl was actually special to him. It was so confusing. He continued to call me to tell me that he loved me but that this new girl was so hot and that she was 100 times better than me. Within a week, he told me he was going to pursue her and that he didnt want to lead me on. But for weeks after, he kept calling me to tell me how wonderful she was but that he still loved me. Just last week he called to tell me that he is in love with her. I feel inadequate and broken. I am not overweight or even ugly but I feel like the most undesirable person on earth. I keep comparing myself to her and I feel so low. He treats her exactly how I wanted to be treated by him. Illogically, I feel like I wasn’t good enough for him and that is why he never showed me the love he is showing her. I hate that she stepped into the shoes I left and is getting everything I ever wanted. He told me he talks on the phone with her for an hour every night. I couldn’t even get 5 minutes out of him while we were together. He is in a relationship with her on Facebook.. he once told me that he thought it was stupid and refused to do the same with me. He introduced her to all of his friends.. I only got to know them after over a year together with him. How do I get over him and feel better about myself? I keep obsessing on the fact that I am not good enough and will never compare to her. Its not like I even want to get back with him after all of the toxic things he said to hurt me. I get nightmares from time to time and its always about him choosing her over me and I always wake up so distraught. Have you guys ever been in this situation where your ex treats their new s/o so much better than they did you? How do I stop obsessing over it and stop it from lowering my self worth?Summary:
Summarize: I was playing at my first PTQ, which was Time Spiral sealed. My opponent and I are both 5-1, going into the crucial round that will determine who will make it into top 8 (top 8 gets an additional draft for single elimination). We were on game 3, and neither of us have any major board advantage. His Errant Ephemeron unsuspends, and attacks me for 4, bringing me down to 7. On my turn, I topdeck a land (this is critical), and play Word of Seizing on his Ephemeron and smack him down to 7. I follow up with an Assassinate on his Ephemeron, and pass the turn. On his turn, he attacks me with an animated flying Totem - I'm down to 5. I topdeck another land, and contrary to what you may believe, this is what wins me the game. "Disintegrate for 7." What happens next takes the entire room of 82 occupants by surprise. "NOOOOOOOOOOOOOooooooooOOOOOoooo!" Turns out, my opponent has been playing in PTQs for years, and this is the first time that he's ever come this close to making it to top 8. The guy is literally in tears, and all I can do is stay by the table to comfort him. Imagine me, a young high school kiddo who's at his first PTQ, taking down someone who has been waiting for this moment for ages. Feels bad. Anyways, I end up being super giddy at the draft (getting a warning during picks because I am not used to the strictness of high level play), and win my first match on the back of the U 2/1 shadow with Undying Rage. I lose fairly quickly in the next round to a well built W/U deck, and go home happy with a Time Spiral booster box in my backpack.Summary:

Summarize: Okay so a few weeks ago I posted on here saying I needed tips making out as I had not done it much before and when I had I had been hammered out of my face. Turns out I was just being a big pussy and it was easier then expected just like every other time. Anyway last thing I posted was asking advice for making out as I was going to a party and thought there was a strong chance of hooking up with this one girl who I thought was hot and we had some connections in the past when drinking and she had showed interest in school the days before the party. Well anyway fast forward to the party and I admittedly got hammered as shit and kind of forgot about the girl I was originally going to go for. I recall saying to my friend "That chick (didnt know her name at that point) is the hottest one here by far and Alex (fake name of another chick from my school that we both knew) is the only one competing"... So the gist of it was I thought this one chick was banggggging. Anyway, this is a pretty big detail here. Earlier that night I was upstairs with my buddy (and this is why im asking you guys to not call me a dick which I am in this case) and we found a pack of smokes in a cupboard. In my drunken state I took them and we went to the garage to smoke. I took a couple rips and gave my friend some cigarettes (I dont smoke other than the odd puff at parties) and he sparked up. The hot chick I was talking about (Ill just call her Jenn from now on) comes into the garage and was asking if one of us had her cigarettes. She sees that my friend was smoking one and asked what kind it was. It was her kind. She starts getting pissed and asking where he got it from. My friend is the worst fucking lying on earth and start changing his excuse and stuff so she pats him down on him front pockets and thankfully ignores me when in reality I had them in my back pocket and I was standing up so she probably wouldve felt them if she searched me. Anyway she had two guys in there who gave her a cocky nod saying theyve got her back so I was ready to tilly but these are all side details that have nothing to do with the post. Point is, I took her cigarettes and she was fiending for them all night. Came in a bit later to garage and friend was smoking another one and she started flipping but at that point I had the cigarettes hidden well in my bag so we were fine. Anyway fast forward back to modern time (at the party) I just said to my friend how hot I thought the chick was and the party goes on whatever just chatting people and drinking etc. Then near the end of the part (like 2:30 or 3:00) I finally meet the chick who I stole the cigarettes from and thought was hot as shit. I was drunk like I said so I had my typical drunk confidence going and sweet talked her for a minute. A different friend of mine comes straight up to me while im talking to this chick and says "Hook up with her" right in front of our faces. Ahahahahahaa. Anyway I go to talk to whoever else and help clean some shit up for the host. Two of my buddies say "Maaan you have to hook up with her" "She wants to hook up with you" and typical shit buddies will say that I take as a joke. This chick is waaaay out of my league. Anyway though I go back to the room where she was and she was on the couch laying down. She asks if I wanted to sleep with her (like literally sleep not bang) and I said yeah Im gonna go help Host out though again for a bit. Anyway I tell my boys whatsup and they tell me I have to hook up with her etc. I was being a big pussy about it though and was like "Naaah we are just gonna sleep" and then they lectured me and said I had to and she wanted me etc. My buddy hands me a condom which I did not think in a million years I would use that night. So fast forward like 10 minutes I go back to the living room where she is and ask if I can still sleep there, to which she replies "yeeeesss". So I hop onto the couch and we just kind of cuddle there for a sec. Host comes into the room and turns the light off and say good night to us, and the other group (one guy and girl on the other couch). We got up for a sec to see if there was anywhere better to sleep in the basement and shit but literally every room was full and the basement was freeeeeezing. So we go back up to the couch. Anyway lights turn off and within 10 seconds she flips over onto me and starts making out. We make out for a bit and shit got more intense (Im guessing I shouldnt go into details here??) but she asks if Im a virgin and I respond I am and laugh and ask if I should bother asking her. Also forgot to mention this earlier she is a year older then me which I figured out in first conversation with her. Anyway I thought she was just asking me about virginity in case or whatever, but I played my cards right. After making out for a while and then (again dont wanna get into too much detail because I feel like a dick saying it here) fingered her and had her shirt off. She states "Oh Id feel so bad" and I ask about what. She says because Im a virgin. And I respond Im not asking you to do anything dont worry. At that point I was happy that I even got to hook up with her and knew I would get crazy props from friends as she was a solid 9.5 with big jugs and ass. Anyway like I said she says she would feel bad but I kept going with her and then she just straight up said I wanna fuck. You get the idea of where it goes from there. Since Im 16 I know you dont wanna know details but anyway I banged her and lost my virginity but was too hammered to stay hard. (HOLY i feel like such a dick writing this here). Anyway thats the update to the story. I went to the party thinking I might hook up with an 8 and ended up banging a 9.5. But the only reason im even posting this is because I have a couple questions. Ill be straight up with you ive been texting her and think it would be sick to hangout with her after school everyday and blaze a bit and bang. I could make this happen easily after talking to her and if I did we would basically be fuck buddies with no strings attached. Now id say im relatively smart and do a lot of reading and everything and will always take any advice when I can get it from anyone who is more experienced/has any advice to give. 1. Is there anything (short of stds) that is wrong/bad about this? And please dont say my age. 2. If she were to figure out about the cigarettes should I just straight up tell her exactly what happened and that I wanted to give them back at that point but it wouldve been too awkward and my chances wouldve been ruined? 3. Do you guys have any other advice I should know before I do this? 4. Any insane heath risks other then STDs at this age because of sex? I mean of course there isnt but still its worth asking. I will take everything into account and if anyone has any crazy point that should change my mind about trying to be FWB they probably will change my mind. I am trying to have fun here obviously but if it isnt the smart thing to do I wont. Thank you for reading and honestly I will probably get downvoted to shit for this one because I came off as such a dick and because of my age. I just wanted to tell the story how it happened. Even if I get one piece of advice I am thankful for that. Since everyone is asking::Summary:

HOLY FUCKING CHRIST, They really fucking rob you now a days My blackberry storm used to cost me $50 to replace everytime it shit the bed with Asurion. Then They charted me $80 to replace my Droid X because the camera button broke. I never filed a claim on my Gnex, but my sister paid $80 to have her Moto Razor X replaced (I think that was the model, claimed to be the best android battery lifed phone at the time ) after she cracked the screen.. Now they want $170 deductible? Just cancel that fucking shit, man what a rip off. I cancelled mine. All that money you pay them you could just buy a new phone, plus its water resistant and with the $20 tempered glass protector, you dont really need them anymore.

Summarize: My boss does this crap all the time. He gets payed 30 grand a year to provide desktop support and a further 40 to do app dev work (which he doesn't do at all), but has gotten into the position where a few of us part time students can do all that work for him. Needless to say, we don't cover all hours of the day (which he does and is responsible for)... and are on extremely restricted schedules due to school. He has no idea what is actually going on with desktop support and constantly hounds us about tickets that were closed hours before because he doesn't actually click the refresh button. Lately he has been taking off 9+ days a month to "work from home" where he occasionally sends messages to us about work we've already done to feel like he's still in control. He also goes swimming for an hour or two every day and attends meetings that have nothing to do with his job most of the rest of the time. <3 bosses.Summary:
Summarize: There was Ancap Minecraft. It was interesting. There was 1.0. It was apparently more interesting. Then some guy released the map. That guy was called Hamster. People xray'd diamonds and things, so the admins gave us 2.0 We are in 2.0. "HCF" is a general term for people who come from Faction servers, namely the HCF server on the Shotbow network. There was a lot of HCF invasions and big vaults and fighting. lots of hacking and world downloading, too, so people were banned. Some people didn't like other people so they used the HCF to settle their mature issues. they collaborated with the HCF and supplied them. It was a huge problem to accuse someone of collaboration whether it was true or not. It was like a communist scare in Cold-War America. I think at this point the World Police existed. They did stuff in 1.0 and 2.0. They pearled a lot of people in a war against Bloodcrew and a guy named Dill. Then they became the LADS. People didn't like what the LADS did. The LADS moved to Duck City and the people who didn't like the LADS sided with the HCF in what was known as the "Duck Roast." The LADS then went and pearled those people, too. Lots of people were caught world downloading and interesting stuff like that and got banned. Then the Recharge came at some point and broke LADS vault and people were upset. Recharge geared themselves and stomped Duck City. Recharge made River's End and the server turned it into a massive waterpark after Recharge got banned/pearled. Then some people griefed some cities because they were scared of pixel horses. Then this summer came. Mexicans scared us. Some Brazilian bystanders almost were permavaulted. But so far it's peaceful between all cities, which is surprising because summers are usually hell.Summary:
Summarize: you are subverting the main discussion that we were discussing. But I will humor you since you think the things people are interested in does not indicate their personality. Lets say a person only enjoys listening to the Top 40 American songs, which are only about clubbing, alcohol, sex and money. Say they listen to this 4 hours a week and this is all the music they ever hear. Do you think its unresonable to assume that the music they listen to might have influence on their world view? They sure as hell aren't interested in philosophy or the human condition or pursuing greater spiritual gains in life. Lets say a person really likes FOX Network. Now, I won't stereotype said person, but its safe to say that they arent the most objective of person. They probably believe all the chain letters they recieve in the email, they probably don't go online and try to find the truth elsewhere. Lets say a 30 year old man can be interested in Twilight, Justin Beiber, Miley Cyrus, and shitty pop music. What does it say about him? He has 30 years of experience on this world, 30 years to read books, exposed to variety of music, talk to hundreds and thousands of people, be responsible...and yet his interest in music is coming from a 16 yearold? Yet, he likes a shitty teen romance book? Or hasn't grown past his teenage life to be a functional adult?Summary:
Summarize: Hey everyone. I just had a bit of a mad dash to get things up and running so that I could (finally) share my hard work with you all tonight. For the past few weeks I've been going hard at trying to create a Dota 2 microlottery focused site. It's hard to believe that with such a huge community something like this doesn't already exist specifically for dota, and the closest alternatives are ones for tf2 where you have to 'make do' with a system not really designed for this game. Now, as for the the site - the goal was simple. Fast paced, always available, high stakes microlotteries that give everyone a chance to turn a few items into many more. There's both a short and detailed user guide over on the site [dota2loot.com]( so feel free to read up on things or just jump in head first, whichever you prefer. The site right now is in what I'd consider a 'beta' stage. I've tested what I can, and would love to see how it performs under load. That's where I'm hoping you guys can help out :) Log in (it's all via steam, only your public steam ID is stored, nothing else), start using / breaking things and let me know what you think. I'll be around to answer any questions you guys might have before I eventually pass out, after which I'll be back tomorrow.Summary:
Summarize: First, you do realize that you are the one slandering him and he kept his views on your racism private and just banned you and only mentioned it in mod mail when you asked why he banned you, right? Do you feel a tad hypocritical. This guys an ass, but he just banned you, you've obsessively stalked him. Second, I can't read the post since you didn't link to it, but the title does sound racist. Why mention that someone of African descent attacked the girl? Why not just say a girl was attacked for wearing a crucifix? Does it actually matter that it was by someone of "African descent?" Also, do you realize that "African descent" is almost always not the right way to refer to a black person unless you're referring to someone who literally migrated from Africa in their lifetime and are acting in a way informed by that? Giving you the benefit of the doubt I'd imagine it's just a misstep, but realize that specifically calling out race is race-bating a bit when it has nothing to do with it. Why not call out the other kids religion? This is like saying the girl was attacked by someone of Irish descent...unless it's a protestant/Catholic English/Irish related attack it serves no fucking purpose. You should ask yourself why you'd mention someone of African descent and not if they were of Irish descent.Summary:
Summarize: When tips become obligatory,it totally defeats the point,especially when waiters act like assholes if they perceive that you won't tip well. The mandatory service charge in my country ensures that waiters get a proper wage and are not at the mercy of their boss/customers. I personally feel that generous people will be generous unless you give them terrible service. A tightwad will use any excuse to justify tipping you less. Waiters shouldn't have to bend over backwards to get $10-$20. Customers also abuse the tipping system and start treating waiters like monkeys by threatening to leave shitty tips.Summary:

Summarize: Hey, guys Sorry for all the information I'm about to give you. I just really want some help from people who know all the facts. I am 21f and my boyfriend is 22m. We go to the same college, and have been dating for over a year, and we live together. When we first started dating, we had sex a lot. It seems like everyday that we hung out ended in sex. It was awesome. Things started to slow down a little bit a few months ago. When we started living together... He is a Christian dude, except not very extreme. He turned to religion when his mom passed away last year. He was "saved" at a church camp he chaperoned over last summer, and is truly believing and passionate about God. He used to sometimes cry and say he wished I would just be "saved." I've told him that I feel silly about it and that I'm just not ready for it. So he has put it behind. I go to church with him and never try to disrespect what he believes and we are both okay with that. Except when it comes to sex. I am on birth control. It has been 2 years since I had an implanon put in. I never get a period. At first my sex drive was extremely decreased. I went a year without sex and was completely okay. But now my sex drive is through the roof. I constantly think about sex and am always horny and ready to go! Me and my boyfriend have great sex and I love it. The only problem is now that he won't have sex with me. The first month we lived together, our sex was normal as ever. It was everyday and sometimes twice a day. Now it is once every two weeks if I am lucky. Every time I try to prompt sex with him, he says that we do it too much and he is "straying from the lord." He will keep saying this until he reaches the brink of his horniness I guess. Then he'll have me give him a super quick blow job, but no sex usually. And that makes me all the more horny. But he never messes around with me or anything. I feel like he looks down on me for being so weak/horny. I have to beg and beg for him to have sex with me, but he will never give in until he wants it. And I can't deny him when he wants it, because I already want it so bad. He says all I care about in our relationship is sex, but it's not true. It just builds up inside and it's all I can think about. I feel like a horny man or something. Like other girls aren't like this. He says the devil is tempting me and I need to speak with God. I don't agree. He will have a HUGE boner that I can feel whenever I'm trying to seduce him, but he will still say no to me! I don't get it. Why is it so hard for him to do? :/ I also find that I masturbate way too much. It can be from at least 3 to 10 times a day. :( It doesn't even calm down my sex drive. At all. I just keep going and going. After sex though, I feel relieved and 'finished.' I can achieve an orgasm through masturbation, but I never feel finished, and can go right back to masturbating a minute later. I'm so embarrassed about it, and he doesn't even know I do it. He doesn't masturbate, (unless he somehow does it at work) because I am with him all the time at home. We shower together, sleep in the same bed, and everything. He will have a boner in the shower and won't let me anywhere near it. I just don't get it at all. Am I pushing him? I feel like if genders were reversed here, it would be really bad. I just don't know how to calm myself down. What should I do??? Other than our sex life, our relationship is amazing. He is everything I ever wanted, and I love him with all my heart. He makes me soooo happy, and I definitely do not want to end things with him over this. He doesn't want to get married until he has finished college and has a steady job. He wants to have a huge church wedding or something and be financially stable. That could be 4+ years before anything like that happens. I've suggested no sex at all until then if it makes him uncomfortable and he said "WHAT! No? I just mean we need to slow down. Not stop." But he doesn't realize that I'm not getting anything. So if this all has to be slow "until marriage" is it going to get worse? How should I talk to him? It's very embarrassing to me, because I'm very shy, especially about sex. So I don't know how to approach this. Especially when he gets all Christian on me. Side note - If it is my birth control that has driven me to being a nymphomaniac, it won't be another year until it is removed. But I'm not sure if it is the cause or not. If so does anyone know a way to counter it or decrease my sex drive?Summary:
Summarize: UPDATE: I've taken a better approach with him. I got down to his level and spoke sweetly to him, held out my hand for him to sniff and lick, he was there for about 5 minutes with me on the floor. I'll get some treats when I can, but I think that's a little progress. I'm visiting my SO for a while. His family has 3 dogs, two of which are completely fine with me. I can approach, pet and cuddle them and they'll just sit there wagging their tails. The chihuahua, I'm convinced totally freaking hates me, and I don't know what I've done to make him so aggressive towards me. He constantly barks whenever I see him (he hears me move downstairs - bark. He hears me flush the toilet - bark), growls at me when he's hiding from someone trying to punish him, shakes whenever I hold him (when family has given him to me to hold, they thought it would help). If I talk, he barks. If I stand up, he barks, if I walk - he barks. Yesterday I sat near my SO when watching a movie, and when I sat up and started talking, he barked in the most aggressive manner I've ever seen - snarling and everything. He was heavily punished by me, my SO, and his owner. I said NO tersely and pointed a finger, and my SO put him outside. It's getting worse with each day, and I have no fucking clue what to do about it. I can't approach him to punish him or assert dominance because he runs away like a coward whenever I try. I've been trying to understand what the hell I did. Since day one he's been like this only towards me, and I've only ever been nice towards him. I don't even want to go upstairs or sit in the living room with family because I know he'll do nothing but bark, and it stresses me out. The family insists that asserting dominance will help, or he'll just get used to me. My SO's dad even suggested bribing him with treats. It's getting to the point where I'm starting to dislike the dog. I know that's bad, and won't help, but after so long of this, I'm sick of this shit.Summary:
Summarize: I actually had a gay porn scout try to recruit me once. Bad news, he's not going to get paid more than $500 to jerk off on camera. Guy on guy is $5000+ Girl on guy, the guy makes 0 dollars. My guess is they're really lowballing him for guy on guy, either that or he has a 12 inch cock, because that's the only way he'd make that kind of money for jacking off or as they call it "a sneeze shot". It's a very horrible business to get into. They fly you out of state, and once you get there, you're the porn companies slave until they send you home. You can't leave early, as they won't pay for the plane ticket. They try to make it sound like it's all fun and games... Kindof like a military recruiter. From what I hear, when you actually get there it's a nightmare. Ever seen those videos of pornstars having absolute breakdowns on camera? Well if you haven't, there's plenty of them out there. I have to stress the fact, that you're boyfriend is going to be tortured the whole time he's there. It's borderline rape. Kind of like "if you don't want to walk home from California to Florida put this dick your mouth". I will personally talk your boyfriend out of it if you want me to. It's a fucking nightmare in a half and I don't want those stupid ass gay porn people making money off of torturing someone. If he does decide to go through with it tell him DO NOT LISTEN TO ANYTHING THE RECRUITER SAYS.Summary:
Summarize: As a lactose intolerant person, I want the bandwagon to roll into anti-lactoseville. Then I will get way more lactose free products. Not fucking soy, not bitch-ass almonds and not motherfucking coconut. I want cow's milk with the fucking lactose removed. There is currently a limited selection but I'm hoping that eventually the bandwagon will come my way and the market will explode giving me delicious dairy treats that don't make my digestive system turn against me.Summary:
Summarize: So, askreddit asked me what advice I had for the younger crowd and this was my contribution. I was too late to the party and nobody will see it, so I'm shamelessly copying it here. Not only does venting feel that much better when someone actually reads it, but I WISH I read a post like this two years ago. So here it goes; I'm not really old, but I'm sad to say that when it comes to buying a house I've grown old out of a bad experience. So, I'll give you; "How to buy a house" . Option 1 : You're buying a new house with all the warranty that comes with it. Well, it's going to cost you, but it's great. Good choice. Make sure the company is a serious one because if it goes belly up during your warranty period you might get fucked. There's not much else that can go wrong here. Spend the extra dollars of having a professional go through the house before the warranty expires just to be sure. No problem Option 2: You're buying a really old house, it looks like shit, and your getting it dirt cheep. Hey, you got a big job ahead, or money set aside to pay someone to fix it up. Either way, that's not a problem because you know this place is a shithole and that's what you're paying for. Option 3: You're buying a old house, but it's partly or completely renovated. Who cares if it's old right? It looks so great, and even though your paying a lot for that newly renovated standard it's still a tad cheaper than a new place right? Great deal right? NO, WRONG . Now is the time to be fucking careful my friend. Anyone can pick up dog shit, wrap it in foil and put a nice little ribbon on it. Looks like fine Belgian chocolate now does it not? Well, it's fucking dog shit. Anyone can paint old rotten wood, and it will look great for about six months. Then you can enjoy the sweet taste of dog shit as it seeps through the tin foil and between your stupid teeth. Anyone can put down some fine ass tiles on a old bathroom, but you won't know if it's really well done until a year later when the bedroom downstairs is either dry or wet as fuck with Winnie the poo and all kinds of shit living in a moldy forest between your floors. But Warcraft MD are you saying I should just stick with option 1 or 2? That really limits available houses. Yeah, it does. But a moldy fuck forest behind your bedroom walls will really limit your lungs, and your wallet if you ever wish to try and resell the godforsaken peace of shit house, that is. So if you HAVE to go with option 3, here's what you do: You can't see the important parts of the house, so be really up tight about the parts you can see. Is there a piece of missing paint at the bottom of the wall by the corner? Who cares right? You can pick up a paint brush and fix that shit up in no time. Probably just some old damage from a kid or a dog or something right? Does not matter, right? FUCKING WRONG . It means the people who live here do not care about details, if they could not pick up a paint brush before selling their newly renovated house they sure as hell did not do a proper job on all the other shit they did either. Is one fucking tile slightly miss-aligned? Don't buy that fucking house or that tile will forever stare you down while your sitting on your throne trying to force out a shit into your shitty house with shitty pipes knowing that you will forever be in a shitty place economically because of he shitty decision you made when you bought a shitty ass house with a shitty ass tile that tried to warn you about how shitty your life could become.Summary:

Summarize: I'm glad I'm not the only one who hasn't been bothered by the ignoring of the constants. In real life, I've found the system degradation rate sometimes is more important than the overall speed. I think you're wrong on the O(1) for memory look up, if anything it's a constant that is a range of time (but still has a max), but the constant time once you hit accessing the last cache level wouldn't increase any more. In other words, if at 1000 items you start hitting the hard disk, the O(1) time doesn't grow with the size of the problem even if you went to 10k or 100k items.Summary:
Summarize: Back in 2005 (3rd grade), this kid (let's call him John) started riding my bus. He, a couple of other people, including my future boyfriend, and I became pretty good friends throughout elementary school, into middle school, and even today in high school. John got closer to me in 2011 (6th grade) just by talking about books and video games. However, this friendship started moving off the bus and into the classroom. He would sit with me during lunch and during class, but my naive self didn't think anything of it. A year later was the first time he asked me out. My friends had been teasing me for months about him, but I insisted it was just platonic. He proved me wrong when he slipped a note in my locker telling me how pretty I was, along with a pen with a plastic parrot on top (how romantic; in his defense, the pen was a pretty hot item at the Scholastic Book Fair). In response, I wrote a note explaining while I was flattered, I wasn't interested and gave the parrot back. After this first attempt I could tell something was wrong. John was a bit moody and we distanced a little, but he came back a couple of months later and we were friends again, just not as close as before. The next year, I started dating a family friend who went to a different school. Eight months later, I broke up with him because he cheated on me. John and another friend from the bus, let's call him Andy, immediately told me he was an asshole and didn't deserve me. Two years later, 2013/sophomore year, he asked me out to go see a movie. I was completely taken by surprise and I had no idea what to say, but I didn't want him to be upset so I told him that it wasn't a good time. To be fair, I was having a lot of family problems and I really didn't want to date anyone at the time, but no matter what I didn't want to date him. I could tell he was a bit upset but that could be expected. Less than two weeks later, I started dating Andy. John was PISSED because he and Andy hated each other (ironically, they're both extremely similar). John didn't speak to me for the duration of the relationship. Andy told me that it was because John was jealous; he revealed to me that he and his friends had known John had liked me since third grade. At the end of Andy and I's relationship, John started saying that Andy was a sociopath: he was manipulative, he was dating me just to spite John, he was just trying to sleep with me. To be fair, Andy might very well be a sociopath but you can see where I might see a red flag or two. We broke up soon afterward and John made sure to be there for me, though I was clear that it definitely not a good time. This year, 2014, John's becoming more persistent. He tried making a move on my best friend (also not interested and looks EXACTLY like me). He's given me gifts. He's texting me more often, often texting again after a couple of hours wihout me replying his original text. He's offerer beating up the asshat that tried to touch me. He's asked me out 3 times in a matter of months. Each time I brush it off, never flat out saying "I don't like you, leave me alone," but I'm getting to my wits end. I don't know how he can't get the hint: he ALWAYS texts me first; I NEVER give him a straight answer as to plans; I avoid any contact that might be considered intimate; I've dated multiple guys that I haven't even mentioned here. I don't want to be an asshole, I don't want to do it over text, and I don't want him to blow up, but I'm not interested. What do I do?Summary:
Summarize: Hello... This is my first time posting anything, and mostly I just wanted to vent, maybe get some perspective. I'm 23 years old and for the last year I have just been working and taking a break from school. I want to start up again (but at a different university, since I've moved) but I'm afraid that I've forgotten how everything works and all that jazz. I've submitted transfer applications, applied for government aid and all, but I doubt I'll be ready to start in the Spring 2013 semester. My list of fears for going back to school: 1) That I'll be too afraid to actually commit and I'll keep putting it off semester by semester. 2) That I won't be able to afford it. I can't quit my job -- obviously -- since I have people depending on my paycheck to help pay a chunk of the household utilitles. I have some government loans already from the first 4 years of school (which have gone into repayment) 3) That I'll fail...again. My first time through, I did well the first 3 years. Started off making As and Bs, then dropped to averaging Cs for a good 2 years, then the last semester and a half I completely dropped the ball, nothing but Ds and Fs -__- I know it was entirely my fault. I lost focus, freaked myself out on not having figure out what I wanted to major in when I was technically a Junior.Summary:
Summarize: The only way to get HIV is if you let the sperm go into your blood stream, which basically means you have to floss really hard right before you blow him and just let the entire load sit in your mouth for a good 30 seconds. If you swallow, you're safer since your stomach acid burns it all away. If all you did was taste the precum (lick it and sort of have it in your mouth then spit out), I'm 100% you're fineSummary:
Summarize: Also (sorry for flooding you, I just know how much it hurts to put one of your creations out and not have it heard as you originally intended) a good tip for uploading to Soundcloud. Don't let soundcloud convert your already compressed MP3 into a 128kbps file. If you use your DAW to convert your raw project into a 128kbps MP3 straightaway (saving any further compression via Soundcloud), it will come out sounding better than if you upload a 320kbps that gets converted into an MP3 again by soundclouds conversion tool. Basically the less times it gets compressed, the better it will sound overall. Try and picture an MP3 like a .Jpg - the more times you save//compress it over and over again, the more quality you lose and more artifacts it will accrue.Summary:
Summarize: Hey, I really like to play a lot of yasuo and I don't get the new trend with triforce. What makes me confused that it came out of nowhere. Yasuo wasn't changed, nor triforce. Some time ago it was thought that triforce prevents yasuo from getting his two importants items - shiv and IE as fast as possible and overall it isn't very cost effective. Even if you buy shiv->triforce, is it really worth it? Triforce is expensive as hell, and you get some stats you don't need, yet everyone started building it out of the blue. Why not IE? Can someone please explain to me why is it worth it?Summary:
Summarize: First off, i'm sorry for the length... My story starts about a year ago. I was working ALOT and started having trouble with the wife. I was addicted to porn then and knew it, but didn't have the will power to work 16hr days and try to break the addiction. My wife had been slowly losing interest in me because I wasn't spending any time with her and when I did I was a cranky jerkass! So eventually the S hit the fan and my relationship with my best friend was in some serious jeopardy. We had some massive fights and I broke, because she was the most important thing in my life and she had damn near slipped away. I fell into a depression and hated life. I was angry at my wife for many things and i was so full of pride. I moved into a separate bedroom and been there ever since. Then things turned around. My uncle called me and spent time to teach me the ways of Jesus. I had been raised a christian, but I had not been raised to love others more than myself. I was christian by name and not by action. I'm trying to change that. So fast forward to a couple months ago where I find this reddit. I had been taking steps to improve myself and be more christ-like. I wanted to win my wife back and really show her that I loved her. I also wanted to break from my slavery to porn. As the bible says, you can't serve two masters. I started out doing about 2-3 days, then moved to a week. After that i've gone about 2-7 days in spurts and have really struggled. Every day is a struggle for me but this reddit has really helped encourage and push me on. I haven't met my goal of 2 weeks but I will!!! I had read all the stories about how nofap made single guys ask out the girl. Well, for me, it made me humble myself and ask to move back into the bedroom with my wife. Not to have sex, but to have her help keep me accountable at night. I only fap when i'm alone. I try to spend more time with her so that i'm not alone. All the anger and resentment I had from our fights has started slipping away and i've been able to start showing her the love that christ has shown me. well, today during my quite time I broke into tears. she came in and asked me what was wrong and I confessed for the first time that i have a bad addiction to porn. She knew i was trying to go without fapping, but I don't think she really understood why. Today I told her about the addiction that i'm under and that i am sorry for all the wrong i've done her. so, /r/nofap/ thank you. thank you for helping me come out about this addiction and thank you for helping me take steps to fix it. christian or not, thank you for helping me start to show the love my wife deserves.Summary:
Summarize: Hey man, throwaway here but I have some advice. As you can see from my account name, I suffer from cumming WAY too quickly. Well, I used to suffer. Here's what I've been able to do to get over my PE: Go as slow as possible. No reason to plow head-first into sex at full speed. Take your time, if you feel the need to cum, pull out and focus on NOT finishing. It might take some practice, but try as hard as you can. Once that feeling goes away, you may reenter. That feeling might come back almost immediately, just rinse and repeat until you no longer feel the need to cum. Usually this whole stop and go thing takes a minute or two until I'm able to go on for quite some time. I've gone from lasting literally 5 seconds to 20+ minutes using this method. If your girlfriend is as understanding as mine, she won't have any problems with the initial stop and go portion of sex seeing as she'll be getting good sex a few minutes later.Summary:
Summarize: Came home after a living in another country for 2 years, father cheated on mom and was not regretting it. Found out he did so while my brother was in the same house, mentally abused him to keep it secret from my mother. Let his son develop a staph infection that developed holes in my brothers back and arms that till this day (10 yearw later) are still visible(scars). Did I mention he is a doctor (father) Physically abused them both. continues to blatenly cheat, No one leaves because he has spent all the money and is now paying child support. Everyone keeps it secret because (I was a bit volitile) Literally day 1 of my trip back he takes me to lunch (still hadnt know). He gives me his reasoning, and states that apperantly my brother wasnt man enough to keep it a secret. And that he hope more from me. I punched everything I could grab, him, his car, the light post next to it. The phone booth (broke my hand). Fought with him and the walls and the belongings of our home daily for 2 years until depression set in and I moved away. Got married had kids .Summary:
Summarize: My dad got a miniature schnauzer when I was about 8 and he's a great dog. He chose that breed because of my allergies (they are less likely to cause problems than long haired shedders) and because they are ratters by breeding. His garden had been overrun by rats from our neighbor's yard. Anyhoo, great dogs, really loyal and fun, and on the easy end of the spectrum training wise. Before my dad passed he had the little guy really obedient and stuff. He hasn't had any really bad medical problems except for a problem with a nerve in his leg that the vet said was probably a fluke issue or an injury.Summary:
Summarize: Its not my problem you have depend on the hand outs of others to survive. To be honest, I couldn't give a single fuck about people who depend on tips. You know why? Because I don't have to. Also, I worked service before H.R. 5970, which would explain my ignorance to it. But, still, its not my problem.Summary:
Summarize: Sometimes. (Trek nerd moment incoming) Gene Roddenberry was emphatic that by the time of The Next Generation, currency-based economics did not exist in the Federation, but most of his writers and producers disagreed with the idea and kept inserting references to credits (they're only mentioned 2-3 times in TNG though, far less than in the original series). By the time of Deep Space Nine, Federation credits were almost never mentioned and in fact were not accepted in many establishments outside of Federation territory - other races (like the Ferengi) still used currency in the form of gold-pressed latinum and that became the de facto physical store of wealth because (for whatever reason) latinum could not be replicated.Summary:
Summarize: I ride also. I am very critical of people being stupid on bikes as it makes us all look bad -- much in the way people abusing firearms makes shooters (like myself) look bad. Be responsible in everything you do ladies/gents! THANK YOU! Any time I have a gripe about either of these topics people GO OFF on me... "Oh, what do you have against bikers/gun owners? What's your fuckin problem? yada yada yada" I have a problem with NEITHER of those things...it's when they are being used by a jack-ass to commit acts of douchebaggery that pisses me off....and I just wish I saw LESS of it. For every responsible gun owner I see, I see some dangerous yahoo who thinks they're toys, and acts like they're an extension of their penis. For every safe/responsible biker I see, I see "Mr. Stunt-rider" poppin wheelies next to me at highway speeds, or "gunning it" through the gap between cars when traffic slows.Summary:
Summarize: I'm about to get out of the military and with that I'll have the opportunity to go to school (almost) literally anywhere I want. I grew up fly fishing the waters of Western PA and I have an affinity for them based on familiarity and nostalgic value. I'm researching schools and was wondering what experiences and opinions my fellow brother's of the angle /redditors had to share. Obviously, with myself being a PA resident, Penn State is quite high on my list (Nearby Spring Creek, among others, is well known for its trout fishing). So, in yinz's opinion-- and regardless of whether or not you actually attended the University, where would you go if you had the opportunity to pursue higher education with the added convenience of great fly fishing nearby.Summary:
Summarize: Ok, so I have this sex swing, or should I say had... I recently moved, and threw all of my belongings into boxes. To get rid of clutter I had a few boxes of stuff I don't use anymore that I filled, drove to Goodwill and donated. Well, after unpacking and searching for the aforementioned sex swing, I discovered it wasn't there. After frantically searching and thinking, I realized that I must have accidentally, somehow, fucked up and put it in a box to donate. I only got to use it a couple of times, and now some kid is probably enjoying it for all the wrong reasons in a backyard play set. One man's trash...Summary:
Summarize: I'm sure that she thinks that way because I haven't kissed her or had sex with her even when I had chance. I'm pretty confident that if I play it cool, she will show attraction when shes over her ex and this could work out if I properly man up and kiss&sex her. Wow this is some fucked up, unhealthy thinking. Your penis is not fucking magic. She is not a child who needs to experience your beautiful penis to realize how she feels. She's an adult and she flat out told you it was a bad idea. You don't get to force someone into a relationship just because she's single now. She knows if she goes for it now she may lose her best friend, because, surprise, you'd be a rebound and she isn't ready to date. It's not about "manning up" or playing some sort of game with her. I'm going to show you your fucked up thinking - how you think you know better than her and aren't respecting her. >Summary:
Summarize: Honestly... I don't want to jump on the "Assholes always get the women" bandwagon because it's a cheap excuse for why you didn't- "Nice guys" need to take some ownership here. Let me break this down: So you're a "nice guy". You are attentive, unoffensive, and act like a true gentlemen. You hold the door, listen, let her speak, and generally make sure she is ok. You know who else does that? Her grandmother. Don't go all in on the first hand. Leave something to be desired. An asshole (player, whatever you want to call it) won't because they just don't care. How can she tell the difference right away? If she asks what you do for a living- tell her your job title- nothing else. Don't fucking rant every goddamn detail like "It's a great job, I'm 5 years vested in the 401k, and the senior partners are really nice. My clients are mostly HVAC, and a few distributors as well.... GAH!" Don't fucking offer up information until she asks- if her interest is piqued, you will have the opportunity, and will help the conversation. And listen to her- but don't fucking stare at her. Don't be creepy and intense. This is difficult- you need to act like you're not into her (Hey- another easy proposition if you're an asshole and actually don't care). She's not revealing the Harry Potter ending- she's just telling you about something that she wants you to know. Posture is key. Don't clasp your hands with elbows on the table. Don't fidget and let your hands play with the glass/silverware. It's fine to lean back- I always find the least defensive posture is to lean to one side, elbow on the chair rail, and the other hand loosely holding your drink. Don't lean back and cross your arms. Pro-tip: Watch talk show hosts- they are very good at being interested but not too intense. To me, the above is why people say "assholes always get the girl". They might be an asshole- but that's not relevant. No woman actually wants to date an asshole- but they want someone who is confident and intriguing- not overbearing, clingy, or too forward. Unfortunately a lot of assholes have these great traits when dating. You can't feign confidence, and if you truly don't give a shit it is almost indistinguishable if it's confidence or not giving a shit. So assholes have a leg up there- not giving a shit about someone's feelings and playing them superficially is indistinguishable from just being confident and happy. It's all about being calm- you don't get overly attentive when your aunt tells you about her new Boston Terrier- bring that attitude on the date. Women (and men) prefer a relaxed environment where the conversation flows, and you will know it's going well when your date starts asking you more questions. If they don't ask questions- you've either scared them by staring into their soul while they told you about their path to a teaching degree, of you already told them everything they were going to ask.Summary:
Summarize: Ok, look. I'm not saying there isn't some effect of porn on the ability for some men to achieve proper arousal but I'm always very sceptical about articles like this. Hear me out. For a start, "Psychology Today" is not a medically-approved or 'official' channel of information in any sense of the word. It's owned by a publishing house and is commercially oriented. In the article itself, there are no links to primary sources or articles in real academic journals. Ok, that's the pinch of salt. Next, a lot of (if not most) ED stems from anxiety. Now the cause of this anxiety could have roots in subconscious cues picked up from viewing porn (my dick isn't big enough, my girlfriend's boobs are too small, etc.) but consider this situation: You're with your partner and things are getting hot and heavy. Your mind is engrossed in the physical act of what's taking place; the sights, the sounds, the smells and your body is getting aroused (for guys, there's often no mental stimulation required at this point, just being intimate with your partner leads to arousal). But what if it's your first time? You're worried you're not doing things correctly or you're going to go limp or s/he isn't doing things that turn you on. Oh god, now your mind's drifted and they can probably tell you're not into it. Shit now you have gone limp, FUCK! Ok sure it's not your first time, this is the significant other you've known for years, you know exactly what turns them on and vice-versa. But wait, did you remember to return that book you were meant to? Isn't there an essay due the day after tomorrow that you need to put the finishing touches on? What if you get rid of the second paragraph and just-- well you get the idea. Shit, now your cock's down for the count, better try and get hard again. Quick, get in the moment, enjoy yourself. Fuck, why isn't it working? So can you see the cycle of anxiety that turns up? Now why not throw articles like this into the mix so that every time you're about to do the business you have an additional thing to worry about? You're just tossing one more log onto your sex-fear bonfire. Sex is a complex thing, there are no rules. There are no laws saying what you can and can't think of during sex. Your brain isn't going to obey you all the time either. Intrusive thoughts about the dirty dishes or those cheques you haven't cashed yet will rear their ugly heads during the act, especially if you're already worrying about how much porn you're watching. Next, there is a difference between porn preventing people from entering and maintaining healthy relationships and porn use directly causing ED. For the former, the porn isn't the sole thing at fault. It's just another handy pillar to tie all your shortcomings on. "I can't find a girl/boyfriend because porn has messed up my standards" or "I don't find sex with my partner exciting anymore because porn." Well maybe it's actually because you won't let yourself get close to anyone, or you see prospective partners as sex objects, one-night-stands or fantasies instead of as real people (don't blame that on fucking porn, sort out your shitty standards). Maybe the sex isn't interesting anymore because you're both in a rut, sticking to the same tired routine. Again, this is on you and your partner. It's up to you to mix it up. Use some of the tricks you learned from porn, why not? If your partner hates it, stop . Simple. Finally, I do use porn, I have been in relationships, I have had anxiety issues, I have had great sex and I've given great sex. Some things to remember: Don't wank before a date It's not all about your stupid penisSummary:

Summarize: It was a poorly written article, but here's what I've gathered: Not directly relevant but mentioned: girl (15) was molested by uncle over several years. Mother found uncle's USB drive full of evidence, uncle is now in jail. Brother (16) and same girl were caught by parents having sex. Apparently, punishments involved being locked in an empty room- for up to 20 consecutive days- without anything but a blanket and a bucket- she apparently wasn't allowed to leave the room to use a toilet. Father is a trucker, and mom often tags along during long hauls (wtf) leaving the 16 year old boy in charge of three younger sisters (15, 11, 3)- including the one he was caught having sex with. During their parents' absence, the brother was acting upon the parents' behalf by enforcing the strict punishment on the 15 year old for a different offence (stealing). With the help of the 11-year old, the captive sister escaped from her captivity and then broke into her parents' room to retrieve a gun. She told her younger sister to take the youngest into the closet and hide. She then shot her brother as he was sleeping.Summary:

Summarize: For the last few months my wife has been acting distant and strange. She has been guarding her phone, working out furiously, and generally seemed unhappy. I chalked it up to a marriage rut. Until recently. A week ago my wife went to a marketing conference in Vegas. She went a couple days early to enjoy the city, I didn't think anything of it really. Also for this to make sense we use facebook messenger alot while she is away to say hi, check in and share pictures of our day. On a Sunday afternoon she happened to bump into a "guy" from X company who she "had met with a few times." I asked who, and she said that it was no one I would no of and this seemed weird to me, because... Generally, my wife talks about every single person she networks with non-stop. There name, who they look like, how many kids they have, etc. etc. etc. And usually she is overly transparent about who she is with, which has really helped me to trust her over the years of these sorts of trips. But this guy from X Co. was a person I literally only new his gender and company that he works for. Something was twisting in my gut, because I got a facebook message that X Co. Guy and her were going to go to a Cirque du Soleil - Zumanity. Basically a sensual sex version of the show. Look up the trailer and tell me what your reaction to this info would have been. Naturally messaged her that it seemed strange to go with him to this show and I was kind uncomfortable, but she was off on her way... with vague reassurances some "other" may meet them there. As she was settling into her seats at the theater I helplessly offered that she have fun, but please call me when she got back to the hotel. Anyways, I was sitting at home uncomfortable and decided to see if I could find out who this X Co. Guy was, I remembered seeing a guy comment on my wife's twitter last fall after a similar trip to vegas. I had no clue who he was at the time, and wasn't threatened, so I forgot all about him. Well, it turns out that he in fact does work for X Co, was calling my wife pet names in a tweet (such as doll), offered to buy her drinks on this current trip to Vegas . . . I guess I should have been paranoidally searching her tweets earlier....... The last twitter straw was this... Apparently sometime last winter my wife sent him a care package for his dog who has gone through surgery. He thanked her for it with a picture of the package, including what I could clearly see as my wife's handwriting telling the dog to get well. PRETTY MUCH FULL BLOWN PANIC. (But it is worth noting that I am not !00% sure that twitter guy is X Co guy, it is possible that they work at the same small marketing company, but how likely is that??) Given what I said before about how much my wife talks about her work and everyone. This care package is def something she would have told me about. At the moment I was spinning. I waited the rest of the time patiently for the show to end, then another 20 min to give her time to get back to the hotel. Then I sent her a FB message >Me: Make it back to the hotel yet babe? >Wife: "Ya I'm at the hotel" FOUR LONG MIN PASS >Me: That’s good. Make it back to your room yet >Wife: Ya but I'm going Back down apparently" >Me: Can we Skype for a min? >Wife: "Fast" >Wife: "Now" What followed was one of the shortest most awkward skype calls ever, she was in the bathroom/doorway, with the lights to the room nearly off, even though she had been in there for 10 min at least and my wife usually is a sleep with the lights on girl. She told me that there were "people in the bar" who wanted her to come hang out and then basically hung up on me. This didn't help my panic. In an effort to shorten this a bit. I eventually decided to pull all the GPS info from our FB Messenger chats through out the weekend. And my fears were strongly confirmed when the GPS locations of 20 message when I knew she was in her room came from one corner of a large Vegas hotel and the above messages from that night (seconds before the awkward hotel room skype call) all came from the opposite end. With heart stopping accuracy. So the one thing I know for sure is, that she Skyped me from someone else's hotel room claiming it was her own. Incidentally, the next message from her after "now" in my inbox was two hours later from the same GPS point telling me that she was "Goin to bed. Love you" at 1:30 in the morning. What should I do now. She hasn't mentioned the night at all since I have been afraid to bring it up so I would love some interpretations of the nights events, along with advice on where to go from here. How to start the conversation about it.Summary:
Summarize: Facepalm > a) Stop worrying about, pressuring for, or talking about an 'official' label or title. This chick is your girlfriend. b) The reason she wants to have sex with you is not so she can kill herself. You are both being dramatic. c) Don't plan the sex. The weather is awesome. Take her swimming or exploring in the woods or something FUN. Spend the afternoon together. Get a bottle of wine later on. When you are both feeling it, whether in the woods or later that night or whenever, put your penis in this woman . Do not stop for some dramatic, depressing conversation about suicide. Don't even think about her killing herself. In fact, just think about how fucking awesome life is and she'll follow your lead.Summary:
Summarize: This was years ago. Met this guy on a probably now defunct dating site. He was younger than I typically would date but figured I'd just take a chance. First, he wanted to take me to a laundry mat to play the arcade game Ms. PacMan. I was ok with this and we split the bill. He kicked my ass in every game. He then suggested we go back to his apartment. Normally I would never do this on a first date but felt comfortable enough that he wasn't going to try and rape, rob or murder me. (don't worry - he didn't) So we made the short walk back to his place and he gave me a tour of his apartment. On his desk was a shit ton, and I do mean a ton, of loose dental floss (not in any package or casing). It was just piled on his desk in a huge mound. I jokingly said, "Wow. You sure do you like dental floss." To which he replied, "Why yes, I do. I think flossing is extremely important. Do you floss?" I do, but not on a regular basis. When I told him this he then lead me to his bathroom where he tried to give me a package of floss for me to keep. I declined the gift and said something about he clearly values it more than I do and I would hate to take it from him. He tells me that it's okay and he has lots more in his closet and never runs out. I still decline. So we head into the living room and I notice he brings with him the dental floss. We talk for a while and at some point started making out a bit. Which normally I don't do on a first date (seeing a pattern here?). We go back to talking for a bit and then he says, "Would you like me to teach you the proper way to floss?" as he picks up the package. "There is a right way to do it and most people are not doing it correctly." I declined his nice offer. I think he tried once more later in the evening as well. Then we played with this machine that calculates your BMI. He kicked my ass in that game too. That was more embarrassing to lose than Ms. PacMan though. The next day I get an email from him that states he thinks I'm fun, sexy, etc etc. And then, "However I am concerned about your lack of flossing and the importance of doing so. I hope you check out this website ... I would love to see you again. What are you doing this weekend?" Never replied back to that one. My runner up bad first date was this guy telling me how the last time he saw his brother that the brother repeatedly stabbed his dog (I have 3 dogs myself) and when he tried to drive his dying dog to the vet he realized the brother had also slashed the tires on his car.Summary:
Summarize: And what, waste police time and resources on a 30 minute lecture for a man-child living with his parents? I've seen this happen before; it's a massive embarrassment for the family and a waste of the cop's time to drive all the way to the kid's house and give a stern talking to. The tax dollars that we earn might as well be burned if it is funneled down on trivial shit like this--much is on the parent for not raising him in the right direction. A cop is not a nanny following around dysfunctional families getting a fuckup together because someone skipped out on parenting the kid's life. What is harming the kid even more is allowing him the stay in the house. If the parent truly wishes her son to become independent, then she should slowly cut ties with him and gradually force him to move out. Now of course the man-child should've been mature enough to move out on his own, but if he was never nurtured mentally by the parent at a young age, then of course his mindset will be rigid at the high school level.Summary:
Summarize: I was in norther India doing geology research about the Himalyans last summer when I got really sick. About a week before my group was scheduled to come back home, I started having chest pains. Initially i thought it was because of my change in diet. (Imagine going from mildly bland everyday diet to having nothing but spicy food every single day.) However, my body had adjusted to the new diet within the first three days of being there. Anyway, every single day my chest got worse. At first it was burning in my chest and throat. Eventually it hurt to swallow at all. Then I could only drink water. On the third day before we were supposed to leave, my lungs felt like they were on fire. It hurt so bad when I would drink water that I would cry. Breathing deep hurt immensely. The night before we flew out of Delhi, I started throwing up continually after taking my Malaria pills. (I didn't have an empty stomache--I had forced some broth/soup down that day). One of the other students brought the professors to me and we all called the college back in the states. The University Medical Center told me that it sounded like I had a pulmonary embolism (blood clot in the lungs) and that if I got on the plane, it could get loose and kill me (more or less). I cried. I had gone the whole trip and the only email I had managed to send was to tell my family that I was alright. Here I was calling my mom telling her that I was told not to get on the plane or I would likely die. Long story short, I get on the plane, am miserable for the 9 hour flight to London, try to take antacid which don't work, cry and try to convince myself that I am going to live to see the US again, and breath. I have never struggled to breathe like that before. I touch down ~ 7 pm and cry to see toilets instead of a hole in the ground I have been having to squat over. My college Medical center tells me to go to the hospital ER to get chest xrays. I walk into the ER ~8 and tell them I just came back from India having chest pains. TIL: chest pains==immediately helped. "India" == quarantined. They do an echo on my heart and chest. In the last week in India I lost 25 lbs. They admit me into the Urgent Care ward. I get my own room and doctors have to wear masks around me. I get xrays and blood drawn. (I have an IV in me but they hold off on giving me water or anything to eat.) Blood results come back that my blood clotting test is way off... and that I might have a pulmonary embolism. They told me not to worry but women on birth control get them at a higher rate and it is not considered "abnormal". There is a chance I would need surgery. They give me stuff in my veins and I get an MRI. Hours go by and I worried what the results show... Results come back that I have nodules in my lungs. (It took so long because they wanted to make sure I was ok--if it was a PE, it could break off at anytime and the best place for me to be would be there at the ER urgent care.) This whole time I have been texting my boyfriend and my mom. They are really worried about me. (I was alone. No one went with me to the hospital. Not even my "best friend" who I called to come sit with me instead of drinking at a party.) My mom was going to come to see me if I had to get surgery. I had a 3 month checkup and it would seem that I am fine. I had a horrible virus in my lungs and a new permanent condition of horrible acid reflux thanks to India changing my body. I still have trouble if I drink too much pop, coffee, alcohol and consume too much chocolate or fried food. Basically, I saw my life flash before my eyes. I was not ready to die and pleaded with God to let me live. (When you are sitting alone at 3 am dehydrated with no food in your system for >30 hours and no sleep for >48, you see what is really important in your life.)Summary:
Summarize: Yeah, well... The problem is that people spend three years getting a degree that makes a neat placemat if you get it laminated, and possibly another year getting hons. and then another year on top of that getting their masters. After those five years, the job-market will most likely have changed, and you'll find yourself shit out of luck. Source: I shared a wing of an office building with people getting MA degrees that would turn them all into organization consultants, which was the hottest of the hot stuff for a bit over a decade, and the place where you found the self-employed heroes of the economy of ages past. Then the bottom fell out of the economy, and fluff like that was the first to go. Fortunately their degrees also enabled them to hop in behind the desk at welfare centres around the country, where they could suffer a miserable existence and hate themselves, their jobs and their clients.Summary:
Summarize: my friend comes up to me this morning looking pretty scared and he tells me about his weekend: so what happened was he smoked two joints without feeling anything (sh*t hits slowly ) then he ate two , by this time i give myself a forehead palm because i know what he has gotten himself into , so because he didnt feel anything he slammed back 10 shots of vodka and waited for it to kick in ( he just ate dinner before hand) and it starts kicking in at 12 where he promptly passes out , when he woke up he was WASTED he told me he could barely move and thought he was dying ( i was pissing myself laughing) and vomited twice , tthis lasted the entire day where he was trying to act normal on a 8/10 high with a low tolerance and hes having a bad tripSummary:
Summarize: First, you do realize that you are the one slandering him and he kept his views on your racism private and just banned you and only mentioned it in mod mail when you asked why he banned you, right? Do you feel a tad hypocritical. This guys an ass, but he just banned you, you've obsessively stalked him. Second, I can't read the post since you didn't link to it, but the title does sound racist. Why mention that someone of African descent attacked the girl? Why not just say a girl was attacked for wearing a crucifix? Does it actually matter that it was by someone of "African descent?" Also, do you realize that "African descent" is almost always not the right way to refer to a black person unless you're referring to someone who literally migrated from Africa in their lifetime and are acting in a way informed by that? Giving you the benefit of the doubt I'd imagine it's just a misstep, but realize that specifically calling out race is race-bating a bit when it has nothing to do with it. Why not call out the other kids religion? This is like saying the girl was attacked by someone of Irish descent...unless it's a protestant/Catholic English/Irish related attack it serves no fucking purpose. You should ask yourself why you'd mention someone of African descent and not if they were of Irish descent.Summary:
Summarize: I'll never see any real reward for my work. I don't like women, so I'm never getting married or having a family of my mine. Literally nothing I accomplish will ever mean anything to anyone. In 50 years, everyone who knows me will likely be dead. Thus, I see zero reason to put myself through the bullshit of 'making something of myself', or 'earning a living' or whatever other bullshit society says I'm 'supposed' to do. So, I'm probably going to kill myself. Society can burn in hell. People are free to believe in the bullshit notion that hard work is meaningful and that you have to work to live. At the same time, I'm free to choose to kill myself, and there's not a damn thing anyone can do about it.Summary:
Summarize: A couple of nights ago a few friends and I were on shrooms, some bud, and a bit of whiskey. We're not hard drug users or partiers, but it was one of those rare occurrences where we actually went out and did stuff. Well, we carry some lawn chairs into this huge field and hang out there for a bit. It's past 2 in the morning by the time we leave and decide to go get some food at the local gas station. We walk there, grab some chips, and than proceed to sit on this abandoned house's stair set. The last two years I've lived here it hasn't been tended to, so it didn't seem like that big of a deal. After bullshitting around for a bit, we get on the subject of cops, and we all decide that if a cop were to come we'd run. No joke, maybe 10 seconds later, my friend Kenzie goes "holy shit there's a cop turning around". Before I know it, I hear gravel moving and a cop pulls up. But wait, there's more! 4 more fucking cop cars roll in. I thought my life was over. Everything ended up being okay, but those 5 cop cars all rolling in while high wasn't too fun.Summary:
Summarize: UK redditor, here. I got a lot out of my degree. I also realised that there were fuck of a lot of people who shouldn't have been there. If you're going to university in the UK and you're getting grades below a mid-to-low C, then you shouldn't be there. Most importantly, you're wasting your own time, which would have been better spent just getting a low-level job in the field you're interested in, buying a few books from a university bookstore (they're in the bookstore because they're on the reading list. That's enough of a recommendation), and working your way up to the mid-level job you'll be able to get with your 2:2 or third-class degree. You'll come out of it with a better understanding than university would have gained you, and you'll have more money and less debts than fresh graduates. Outside of that, by going to university, you're wasting the time of the people running the course, you're wasting my time, you're probably dragging down my grade if you end up doing group-work with me and you're definitely contributing to the decreased perceived value of a degree and the skewing of university grades which has meant that half the job adverts you see specifically require a 2:1 degree or above. One of the most frustrating things I've seen during the recent protests was someone who said they thought that "education is a right". That idea can fuck right off. A basic education is an obvious social positive; a well-educated populace is more useful, more able populace. That doesn't make education a "right", it simply means that not providing one to the population is stupid and counterproductive. It sets up a child to go into a field with enough skills and knowledge of a field that they can more easily progress in it. I don't think the current basic education system *works", mind you, I just think that it's a sound idea. A further education, on the other hand, is not a "right", it's a job . It's you shouldering the responsibility of turning yourself from a generalist into a specialist; of making yourself useful in a field. Note the word "responsibility". "Rights" don't come attached to responsibilities, not the real "rights", the ones they're not even allowed to take away from you in prison. You can't fuck up badly enough that anyone's legally allowed to take them away. Those are "rights". That isn't what further education is. Access to further education is earned using whatever combination of money, social aptitude and being intelligent enough to be there you need to use to get in. What I'm saying here is that unless you're pretty certain that you're going to be really, really good at something, and that you're going to need personalised attention from experts in their fields in order to progress to a level where you can begin to excel, and to push the boundaries of your field, save your time and money, get a job and buy a textbook. To get on my political soapbox for a moment, the "everyone deserves a chance at higher education" idea is not founded in socialism, but in corporatism. Companies and employers should be taking on the burden and the risk of taking people into jobs where they train them up to an expert level. That burden and that risk is instead being taken up by taxpayers (directly, in the UK, and through the despicable student debt system in the US). It is a problem identical in type (though obviously not in scale) to the ridiculous "bank bailouts" whereby corporations are manipulating governments into socialising the risk of sending people to higher education and capitalising all of the rewards. It's stupid, mad and wrong and it's butchering your financial future for the sake of the modern monarchy of international money-people.Summary:

If your legs are perpendicular to the ground, you're gonna have a bad landing. Training to bow hunt with my dad. popped one straight up in the air, because apparently I was a little retarded Hiawatha. He heard the string release, looked back at me, just said "Fuck." and grabbed the back of my shirt and casually dragged me like a sack of warm shit. as the arrow fell a few feet away. Ran out into one of our pastures where we had a new bunch of cattle (that weren't too fond of people). Figured I'd run after em and scatter them shits. I bolted throttle open, screaming "WOOOOWOOWOOWOO!" Like I was a brain-damaged firetruck. these bitches looked dead at me, stopped chewing, and I swear one got wide-eyed and shouted "DEATH!" They were so hot on my ass that when I dove, yes dove, through the gate, the lead pursuer smashed into the gate. climbed onto the roof of an old barn, Long story short: Creak, snap, crash, full pound of fecal matter, headache, half-body bruise. Took a buddy shooting once when I was about 10. I briefed him on proper firearms safety, bu apparently he was weapons-grade stupid, as he thought it would be funny to fire off a round at me to scare me. it Hit about a foot away from me and he dropped my rifle, covered his mouth, and began apologizing. This did not excuse him from the pump-knot that he so desperately campaigned for. and numero uno!!! When I was fourteen I was driving a nice comfy closed-cab tractor (cutting hay). In my left hand was the steering wheel and a recently acquired "Hustler" magazine. In my right hand, weenie hard enough to cut diamond getting beat like a Gitmo detainee. I came, I saw, too late. I went off the side of a creek bank but not all the way down. I was able to back out. One more second of negligent driving and I would have ended up roughly twenty feet upside down.Summary:

Summarize: My ex [21F] and I broke up a year ago. We dated for almost 4 years and she was manipulative, borderline uncaring, and cheated on me, which ended the relationship. I lost my virginity to her, which I regret. I have no idea why we stayed together. There was this deep attraction to each despite how terrible we were as a couple. I don't understand. Fast forward to today. I've been dating my new girlfriend for about 7 months and I have never been happier. She's everything I could ever have hoped for. She's beautiful and funny and we completely click. I'm madly in love and unless something drastically changes for either of us, I could see us getting married somewhere down the road. So my question is why the hell do I still think about my ex all the time. We broke up a long time ago and the relationship I'm in now is better in every way possible. I have absolutely no regrets breaking up with my ex. It's one of the best decisions I've ever made. I suppose I should also put in here that we tried staying in touch for a little while, but that we haven't spoken in several months. When I think about her all I think is stuff like "I hope she realizes what she let go." Crap like that. I don't get it.Summary:

Summarize: O stary... U mnie w pracy standardowym radiem jest Trójka. Ostatnio w poniedziałek rano grzebałem coś przy radiu i jak się później okazało przez pomyłkę ustawiłem 87,8 zamiast 98,8. Leciały akurat motyw z Fraglesów, to tylko się uśmiechnąłem, że znowu jakieś żarciki ze strony trójkowej redakcji. Potem przy piosence o jabłkach i gruszkach zacząłem się zastanawiać, czy to czasem nie Dzień Dziecka. Ale jak popłynęli z motywem z jakiegoś słuchowiska, które pamiętam z jeszcze z winyli, to stało się jasne, że coś jest nie tak. Albo - że jest bardzo TAK. I wiecie co? Nie wyłączyłem jeszcze przez dłuższą chwilę. Te piosenki mają w sobie coś z /r/GuiltyPleasureMusic połączonego z dawką nostalgii od której nie sposób się oderwać. Od lat grzebię nocami w necie zapuszczając się w jakieś zapomniane korytarze alternatywy, słucham jakiegoś nienazwanego projektu z 15 wyświetleniami na YT, zapomnianego zespołu z Bandcamp, wydaję majątek na płyty i koncerty, jeżdzę na te wszystkie OFFy, Open'ery itp., ale częstotliwość 87,8 rozłożyła mnie na łopatki. Nic na to nie poradzę.Summary:
Summarize: Ok, I'm curious what the odds are of getting an 8. I'm pretty awful at math so I got stuck, and probably also made some errors along the way. I know some of you bastards are fiendishly good at this -- can you pick up where I left off, or explain why I was headed in the wrong direction? Ok, so an expert board has 36 * 16 = 576 squares, of which 99 are mined. The odds that a given square on an unexplored board is safe are (576 - 99) / 576 = 53 / 64 The odds that some given neighbor of a clear cell is mined are 99 / 575 (because we have 99 mines and 575 potential places for them -- we know that a mine can't be located on the clear square we're investigating.) Now imagine we have a clear square with one of its neighbors identified as a mine. What are the chances that another given neighbor is also mined? Well, we have 98 mines left, and 574 squares where they could be located, so the odds are 98 / 574. For a clear cell with two specific adjacent cells that are mined, the chance that a given unexplored neighbor is mined is 97 / 573, and so on. So on an unexplored board, the chance that any given cell has eight mined neighbors are: (99 / 575) (98 / 574) (97 / 573) (96 / 572) (95 / 571) (94 / 571) (93 / 570) * (92 / 569) Which can be expressed as: (99! / 91!) * (568! / 575!) The odds that a cell doesn't have eight mined neighbors are therefore 1 - (99! / 91!) * (568! / 575!) = 0.999655... This is where I get stuck, because each cell that is determined to be a non-eight disqualifies a bunch of other cells from possibly being eights (the number of cells it disqualifies depend on whether or not it is located near the edge or not, since edge cells can't be eights anyway), so the possibly that there exists an eight goes down with each explored non-eight, non-mined cell.Summary:
Summarize: Though I'm a straight guy, I feel the need to comment. I'm a little heavy set, so I'm probably getting bad reads, but I'm like 5 1/2in length and 5 1/4in to 5 1/2in girth. The majority of women only feel so deep inside their vagina, and after a point it becomes unpleasant and even painful. I could be wrong, but the number I heard was 4 1/2in inside. If your hitting the end, I can imagine she would'nt feel too good. IMO, that's why it's better to have a average length but thicker penis. bang up the walls, don't knock out the bottom. AND, a girls weight matters. You're gonna be able to get more in on a skinny girl. on bigger girls, there's more fat and it's harder to go all the way in. it just is, your path way is blocked by their legs, unless you get creative with positions, and yknow that's another story.Summary:

Summarize: Every year since about the 6th grade, i've gone to our little town fair. It use to be in the mall parking lot, huge, well kept, polite staff and always busy for the week or so it was here. But the last 2 years it's been rather small and kinda shady, rude staff, moved to a smaller empty lot behind our local outback. This year my boyfriend took me, as a little I'm sorry were not going to prom. We're walking around for a little while, it's still pretty early in the day so it seems mostly like little kids and their parents are there. Him and I decide we're going to ride the bull, something I've done quiet a few times growing up going to rodeos. This was his first time, I paid for him and begged him to do it with me, I explain what he has to do, how he cant hold it with two hands and what not, and he does well for his first time, on for about 15 seconds at full speed and shaking. Now it's my turn, I hop on and ride with no issue, I'm wearing skinny jeans so i'm not entirely shocked when I get a wolf whistle about the little bit of lace that got flashed on one turn around, thinking it was my boyfriend. I get off and walk back up to him, dizzy, and a carny comes up and tell's me I was one of the longest riders in this town. I quickly thank him and give a big proud smile holding on to my boyfriend. He quickly pulls me away to the carousel and leans down to kiss me, and I stand up on my tip toes to reach. The same carny apparently works this ride, comes up to us and in the most sarcastic tone possible goes "Aw aren't you cute" keep in mind, this guy is probably about 30, and smells like weed, mixed with fair food. He looks at my boy friend and goes "But maybe she deserves someone a little better fit for her, or at least know's how to ride a bull." I pull my boyfriend out of line, pissed off and grossed out. He tells me well go back when that guys not there, we walk around some more and get some treats and ride some other things. Probably about an hour later we head back to the carousel, i'm carrying my big stuffed koala bear and we get back in line. No sign of creepy carny, we get our wrist bands scanned and get on. I sit on the outside while my boyfriend sits on the middle horse. Rides going, and suddenly creepy carny is back, he hops on quickly, and holds onto the pole my horse is attached to. He just stares at me for a bit until I go "can I help you?" My boyfriend is watching slightly amused, i'm not something to be messed with and he knows as much. The carny looks at me gross yellow teeth stretched out in a grin and goes "Yeah how bout you show me some more of that lace and i'll get you a bigger bear than that sad thing." I'm completely disgusted and creeped out. I tell him to fuck off before I call the cops, but he's not getting the message, until the ride stops and my boyfriend stands up. He towers over this guy and goes "she said fuck off, or i'll have the cops here in two minutes." Creppy carny buggers off and follows around the rest of the night, until i'm so freaked out we have to leave.Summary:
Summarize: Reddit, Please, please, please give me some insight on this. It's driving me crazy: I've been spending a lot of time recently with a "straight,” pro-gay fraternity friend watching TV. He’s a 2nd year, but we’ve never really talked or hung out until now. I’m a 5th year, and he, as well as the entire fraternity, knows I'm gay. We've been meeting up in my dorm room (inside the fraternity) about every other day for about 3 weeks now to watch Game of Thrones, and now True Blood. It's almost always just him, but if there's a 3rd person, it doesn't happen. Let me explain- he's been putting his legs up against my feet while we're watching TV, and I'll gladly rest my feet there on his thigh or leg for the rest of the episode. Here's the setup: my room is tiny, and I sit in my desk chair with my feet propped up on my bed. He sits on my bed facing the TV, which is near me, so his legs are positioned towards me. The first day of watching TV, it was extremely subtle- he would put his legs up against a single toe, then I'd slowly creep my whole foot closer and closer to the point where I was obviously resting them against his leg. On the 2nd day, this happened much faster- I put my feet near him and then he brought his legs in to meet the soles of my feet. This has been happening almost every single time since then, and when it does happen, it would be for about 80% of the time we're watching TV together (anywhere from 1-4 hours). There's sometimes an obvious pushing force from his side, but not enough to push my feet away. Sometimes, I even snuggle my toes under his legs. If he repositions, it will usually happen in such a way that I'm touching another part of his legs, like his knees. I've been pretty frustrated lately, because now I'm starting to think he might not be entirely straight, and I'm starting to like him. I finally mentioned something to him last week- I pointed to my feet resting against his thigh and asked him if I was violating his personal space (even though he's the one that usually instigates). He said no, and I said that none of my straight friends would be so comfortable with that. He shrugged and responded that I have clean feet and that it doesn’t matter. At this point, the True Blood intro sequence is over and we go back to watching TV. This week, the behavior has escalated. A few days ago, he counted the toes on my right foot, touching each one individually with his finger, for just a single pass. Then yesterday, he quickly and briefly grabbed my knee during an intense moment in the show. Then today, he rested his feet on my chair in such a way that it made my whole chair and body swivel towards him. Our legs were touching, essentially snuggling side by side. At this point, he puts his feet up against my right thigh, and I gently rest my hand on top of his foot. He didn't move, so I slowly began to sort of tickle/play with his toes. This happened for about 10-15 minutes, and he never pulled away. After that, I went to the bathroom and came back, and for a full 2 episodes, nothing happened. Nothing at all. He stayed outside of my reach. Writing all this out makes it sound very obvious what's going on. But I've been talking with some [pro-gay] friends that know him better than me, and they assure me that he's straight. They say he's just a touchy-feely guy that's extremely comfortable around men (especially since he's been on a water polo team). Something else that makes me think I might be wrong: there have been a couple days where absolutely nothing happens when we’re watching TV. Also, every now and then, he’ll retract his body in such a way that I can no longer reach. I really hope that my gut feeling of him being bi or gay is not wrong, but I don’t want to get my hopes up any more. This boy is one of the hottest, cutest, and most attractive people that I know, and I don’t want to fuck anything up either. Reddit, what do you think is happening, and how should I proceed?

Summarize: People can really f ool you. I had a counselor in elementary school who everybody LOVED - especially the kids. He would sit with the kids at lunch and pass around a couple boxes of oreos, and he seemed more like a f riend than a teacher. He was also a pastor and an incredible artist, and he'd take requests from the students. I was one of the more troubled kids at the school, didn't really have any f riends and had already been expelled from 3 schools, so he decided to let me join the morning show. I thought he was pretty cool, and we became friends. I can't really remember everything, but he did take me to the movies one time, and a f terwards he took me to Wal-Mart to get a Hot Wheels car. A f ew weeks later, he took me to this small church and we worked on morning show stu ff together. My dad's nope alarm went o ff pretty quick, and didn't want me to hang out with him anymore. He said something just didn't f eel right about the guy. My mom pretty much overthrew him, though. Two weeks later, the owner o f the church f ound over a dozen recordings of him drugging/molesting/raping **children in the church computer, as well as a list of over 100 boys he planned on molesting. (Dad: "BAM, DAD KNOWS BEST GET REKT MOM") My name was on the list, but he never tried anything despite having me alone in the church. I think it was because I was a pretty aggressive/violent kid, and I probably would have f ought back or something. He had threatened the other kids with violence if they told anyone. He claimed that he did it because his f ather had done it to him. He had two children, a little older than me.Summary:
Summarize: Beyond your knowledge in IP law, some of the knowledge that you have is irrelevant to the issues--for example those of "political economists." This has nothing to do with the Poketubers. The intellectual property issues that you are bringing up are not specific to Poketubing and there are few, if any, policies that "threaten the livelihood of Poketubers". Pokemon Showdown has 10 thousand members online at peak times. Obviously, if Gamefreak/ Nintendo wanted it to stop, they would have sent a cease-and-desist already. So much for intellectual property issues. The second point that you bring up, "the effects of YouTube and user-moderation in viewpoint diversity", overlooks an important point. That is, Poketubing is largely merit-based. To be successful, you must be a skilled battler or a good entertainer. There are exceptions, but for the most part the mainstream is the mainstream for a reason.Summary:
Summarize: I've been playing my blues Jr. for several years now and its excellent for gigs of all sizes. The only down side to this amp (which I know is kind of ridiculous) is it's size. I want to upgrade to a bigger Fender amp but i'm having a hard time finding a basic/simple comparison between amps like the Twin, The Reverb, The Deluxe, The Hot Rod, The Deville and so on. Anyone of these amp's seems like it would suit my needs but I'm not sure which will be the best bang for my buck.Summary:
Summarize: When it comes to talking to girls there are two pieces, state and articulation. State is all about your status. How you are projecting yourself, how the girl is responding to you. If you go up to a girl and think she is going to think you are creep then you are going to have that anxiety and project that on to her and that will in turn make her feel uncomfortable and want to leave. If you believe the conversation is going well, it will. If the conversation went well, ask for her number. The worst thing that can happen is that she would reject you and then you go on your way to talk to another girl. Articulation is like a puzzle of a famous painting. if you are able to do it fast and well. You won't have any problems flattering any girls. I was depressed for a long time, It wasn't something that ever got easier. But I taught myself how to articulate myself. Smoking weed also helps teaching yourself how to articulate better in conversations. The thing about language that is amazing is that there are many ways to say one thing. It takes true restraint to really take a step back and think about what you are saying when talking to people. I prefer to think of articulation as the art of provocation. When you think about some concept it helps to break it down into its parts and think about it, mess around with it. When we know in our brains what we need to say it makes composition and words choice and all that stuff so much easier. Articulation requires a larger than normal vocabulary, reading helps a lot. The words you use to craft the message is the conduit to that girls brain. The goal is to get her brain to go to the same place your brain, the same concepts, the same flow and feel of how the transition went in your brain. If your message was a drug, you want that drug to have a purity as high as possible. Now here is the part where it gets tricky, body language. Body language has more power than any words you could possibly use. If you tell a girl she is wearing a really pretty dress, but you are frowning, she can feel the loathing in your voice, you aren't making eye contact. It doesn't matter if you compliment her, if you don't have the proper state and stance to back up your words so that they are genuine it won't matter. she will think either you are weird (in a bad way), something is wrong with you or anything other than what she is supposed to feel. Maintain state, make sure she is getting a clear message.Summary:

Summarize: So many Americans pounced on him in the comments. Comment boards on video websites are not good places to get an accurate impression of an entire culture, especially a culture as populated, wide-spread, and diverse as America. >I have friends who are from Japan and South Korea (I go to college in the US) and they too would literally do anything to be successful and rich. Americans are the same. The internet provides anonymity combined with selected judgement. You an anonymously comment on a 15 minute video, typically with no context or background. video: Here's one of the most expensive first class airlines in the world comment: screw the rich, people are dying! video: this billionaire is lending his one of a kind airplane to fly children dying of cancer to 3 exotic locations for charity. comment: OMG, he's such a great guy! Warren Buffet and Bill Gates are examples of rich people Americans love. Steve Jobs has mixed responses, and Rupert Murdoch is generally despised. These are all modern rich. If you look at the histories of people like William Randolph Hearst, or the Vanderbuilts, they did some pretty terrible things in their time while accumulating their wealth. Now-a-days, they're admired and revered. The point I'm trying to make here is that people don't hate the rich, they hate their decisions and actions ... and even that is selective. People read one article about a 5.6 million dollar home, or a fleet of private jets and they think about what they would do with that much money, because they wouldn't be selfish enough to spend it entirely on themselves. But that same guy could have donated 3 times that much to a great charity, and purchased this for himself as a reward. Or hell, maybe he plans on letting charities use his fleet to deliver doctors and medicine to impoverished nations when he doesn't need them. We won't see that in the news article, people will assume the worst and bitch (anonymously). Finally, there's the actual culture and on-goings of American politics and economy. Religion, fear, terrorism, anti-intellectualism, anti-vaccines, the tea party, gun rights, women's rights, racial equality, social security pitfalls, minimum wage, internet censorship ... these all impact Americans impressions, opinions, and interaction. When there [are articles like this]( posted weekly showing how our political system has been purchased by the elite, some people will get angry beyond their normal level of rational and make stress driven, anger filled, blanket statements that aren't accurate.Summary:

Summarize: Freshman year- My Gf and I had been out most if the night at a friends apartment making weed butter and then a bunch of edibles. Between all the butter that had gotten on us while we cooked and all the edibles we ate we are both sky high. We get back to my on campus apartment, nobody's home. My three roommates all stumble in loudly about 30 mins later drunk as hell, they had been a some party. We are sharing the stories of our nights when we suddenly hear a shriek from outside. We are all fucked up so none of us really react until we hear a girl running down our hall screaming "help help!" Me and my four roommates all rush outside, my gf and a couple other girls stay behind in the room. We get in the hall and this panicked girl is just sayin"upstairs upstairs please you guys have to do help!" We are all way too fucked up to know what to do so we all just bolt for the stairs and run up to the third floor. We throw open the door to the hall to just see the walls covered in blood. Like fucking everywhere in HUGE streaks across the walls and big semi-soaked in puddles on the carpet. Despite being high as shit I am the most sober one of the four of us so i took the lead and ran towards this writhing body on the ground, then notice there is a girl crying hysterically nearbye and some shirtless dude holding her. This kid we all knew is just in a heap on the floor, he has this massive gash on his head that is just hemorrhaging blood and there is this huge rock like two feet to his left covered in blood. So I grab the kid and using what training I can remember while I'm so fucked up my roommates and I try to to talk to him and carefully rolled him onto his back. Although the whole time he keeps trying to sit up and grab at the rock while making this just like guttural moan. " Jack (not his real name) what's going on?" "Unnnnnggggg" "Jack come on dude speak to me what the fuck happened." "Unnnnngggggg" roommates:"Steve what do we do?!?" "Shit, well if he can't communicate we don't have a choice call 911" (bear in mind we all liked this kid and new that if we called the paramedics and cops this would be it for him at school) roommates look at me hesitantly but say" alright FUCK" So roommate A runs off to call for help while B,C, and I try to piece together what's happening while stopping the blood from gushing out of jacks head. Shirtless dude" we were watching a movie and suddenly we hear a knock on the door, Girl went to answer it and as soon as she opened the door this crazy fucker just decked her in the face!" Although he didn't elaborate more we were never sure how much of the damage on jacks body was dealt by shirtless guy but I have no doubt it was more than a little. While he is telling this to roommate C I am looking jack over and that's when I look in his eyes to see they were dark red and had pupils the size of dimes" FUCKING SHIT! He's high out of his god damned mind!" Turns out elsewhere on campus earlier that night jack had eaten several candies laced with LSD and was tripping his balls off. So anyway at around that point two cops, one of which I had a bit of a history with suddenly burst into the hallway guns drawn. We all throw our hands up as we are being aimed at and so jacks head starts gushing more blood. "What the fuck is going on?!" Dick cop yells "Don't shoot! We found him like this, he needs attention now! Also I think he's on drugs because he is completely nonresponsive, and keeps trying to hit himself with that rock!" I shouted gesturing to the big bloody stone. The cops thankfully lowered their guns and holstered them but then dick cop pulls out his taser and starts threatening jack with it ordering him to get down and comply or be tased. Roommates B,C,and Start yelling" No STOP! He doesn't understand what your saying let us just hold him down he's fine he just needs medical attention!" "Back away from him NOW!" So we all stood up, pretty well covered in blood, and did as he said. Jack pulled himself towards the wall and leaned against it but roommate B grabbed the rock and moved it away from Jack, who still kept reaching for it and the cop kept threatening to taze him if he kept moving, not that jack understood. Eventually the paramedics arrived and carted away Jack, and treat the girl who got a huge black eye. Never heard from jack again personally but B did and he said that according to Jack he had no recollection of how he wound up in our building or why he punched the Girl, but that he kept hitting himself with the rock because he saw it as his brain and was scared if he didn't get it back into his head he would die. So ya that was the craziest thing I saw in college although I do have some other good stories as well. Always remember kids, drugs can be fun, but they can also be very very VERY dangerous.

Summarize: I had a vegan as a legal guardian for 2 years when I was 15. Biggest fucking bitch this side of the planet. She would always force her bullshit veganism on me. When I had enough of her shit food (she was a shit cook), I decided to get a job to buy the food (read: meat, cheese, eggs) that I wanted. Nope. She would not allow me to store meat or any other non vegan food in the fridge . So I said I would save up and buy a mini-fridge. Also nope. She said if I wanted to eat meat, I would have to find another place to live. That's exactly what I did. I called up my mom and convinced her to take me back. I lived in Alberta at the time, and she flew me all the way back to Québec. I flipped my entire life upside down just to get away from that crazy bitch Best. Decision. Ever.Summary:
Summarize: I'm with a great guy and we've been together about a year. I haven't been this happy with someone in a very long time. We gel. But he.. does things. He might say something painfully insensitive, or leave his underwear on the floor in the bathroom, or spit nasty loogies (is there even a correct spelling for this?) in my sink. I'm fairly passive and don't like conflict by nature, so I when I feel myself boiling over, I retreat and then bring it up jokingly days later when I've relaxed in a "oh ha remember that one time when I was pissed the f off at __ ?.. oh you didn't know?" kind of way. Those days inbetween are killer though, because I'm a nightmare where I'm mad but I won't say why. Mostly because I just don't have the language to express it.Summary:
Summarize: A lot of you requested an update to my [original post]( The majority of you suggested that I speak to Brooke and/or attempt to walk in on the act. I decided on doing both. Sunday night everyone was back in the apartment. I had every intention of speaking to Brooke about the neighbor's comment alone, but before I could she said something that completely threw my theory off. She told Derek to get to bed so he wouldn't be tired for work in the morning. What. I knew Derek has a job on campus, but he had always worked the same night shifts. Being as casual as possible, I inquired how long he'd been working mornings and when he started. He said he picked up the extra shifts a month ago and worked at 9. (I leave at 7:45 so it's possible for me not to have noticed that). I spent the rest of the night trying to figure out whether he was lying about that, whether still he had some mornings here at home, whether Alexis could be seeing someone other than Derek in the mornings (like some of you suggested) or (again) if I was just a paranoid loser. I went to bed feeling emotionally drained and confused. The next morning I left for classes as usual and operated on autopilot. I alternated between thinking I'd run home to check on Alexis and thinking I had way too much work to run around based on a theory that I wasn't even sure about anymore. In the end, I walked out of my first class and straight to my car to go home. In a weird way, I sort of wish I hadn't. When I got to the apartment Derek's car wasn't there, just Alexis'. I walked to the apartment with my heart pounding all sorts of crazy. I don't know what I was expecting. Outside the apartment door I could immediately here a guy's voice inside. I heard him talking and laughing and a soft feminine mumble replying and giggling back. I've been on this subreddit long enough to see all the different reactions people have to this situation. I never once contemplated what I'd do. I pressed my ear to the door and see if I could make out what they were saying, but I could only make out a word here and there. There was a lot of giggling. Then, I heard the sound of Alexis being tickled and shrieking. Maybe I should've waited more. In retrospect I wish I did, but I couldn't take it. As soon as I started fiddling with my keys, it was dead silence in there. She was fucking Mark. I never mentioned Mark in the previous post but he's one the guys in the apartment next to us ( not the one that tipped me off). He's the only one I never liked. Fucking know-it-all douchebag attitude. Always made inappropriate comments towards both girls. Never thought anything of it. As soon as I opened the door, they both gave me a deer-in-headlights look that removed any naiive doubt I may have retained that the situation was innocent. I was planning on yelling at them or demanded answers, but (and this is fucking embarrassing) my eyes began to well with tears. I didn't want them to see that shit. So I said "Nice. Real fucking nice." and bolted back to my car. I heard Alexis yelling my name in the hallway and picked up the pace. I sort of expected her to be chasing me but by the time I got to the car there was no one following me. I drove to a park that's near the apartment and sat there in disbelief. My first thought, weirdly enough was How is my family going to take this? What the hell am I going to tell them? My family fucking loved Alexis. They joked about our wedding and regularly called her part of the family. Then I started thinking about living arrangements. Our finals end in about two weeks, there's no way I can handle moving now. I'm applying to an extremely competitive graduate program and I can't let anything get in the way of that. Definitely not this cheating bitch. I'm writing this from a friend's house. I explained the situation, he explained it to his parents and they welcomed me to stay in their home. I'm going to have to go back home to get some clothes sometime. I'm planning on going during this lab period I know Alexis can't skip tomorrow. It took her an hour or so to start blowing up my phone, but once she did it didn't stop. She started off asking me to come home so she could explain. Before I even had the chance to respond she sent another one begging me to come back because she was having an anxiety attack, something I always help her through. Maybe I'm heartless, but all I could think was good, you earned it . There was a pause and then she sent "I don't know why you get so jealous, we were just hanging out." I waited. She sent "Look, I know it looks super sketchy, believe me if I were you I'd think the same thing, but we didn't do anything. He needed advice on his girl problems. You have to believe me." No, no I don't. Normally I would have gotten a weird sense of satisfaction watching a cheater scramble to cover their ass, but my stupid brain just kept replaying all these great times we had together and wondering if she was cheating then too. I want to know when this started, but at the same time I'm worried it's been going on for longer than the month I've suspected something. I received a text later that night from a number I didn't recognize. It was the nice dude from next door. He said (paraphrasing because it was a long text) that he got my number from Derek. He was extremely sorry for what I was going through and that he would have told me sooner but he wasn't completely sure. He said he knew his friend was seeing a girl with a boyfriend, but didn't put it together until he learned the girl's name. As many of you suspected, the comment was him trying to tip me off. So yeah, I guess he's bro of the year. I don't think Derek and Brooke know yet. I haven't texted them. I haven't found the words. I know it's going to turn our living arrangement and friendships upside down. I guess I should message them before Alexis paints a different picture. I wonder what the cool neighbor said when he asked for my number. I don't think he told them, the would have said something... Right? Unless they took her side. Then I've lost my girlfriend and friends. Any advice on coping with something like this, especially from those who have been there before, please let me know. I don't have many friends to reach out to besides the guy I'm staying with. Alexis, Brooke and Derek were basically my family. Alexis and I had talked about spending our lives together. I have never been serious about a girl the way I was with her. EDIT: I am seriously moved by the amount of support you guys are giving me here. Please keep them coming, I may not reply to all the comments but I've read each one on both posts. I'm going to tell Derek and Brooke soon. I'll try to do a follow up when I have some sort of plan.Summary:

Fast forward a few weeks, and I found another person. Daisy still claimed to love me. I wasn't sure who I wanted to be with, so I let it play out for a while. I ended up choosing the girl who I met afterwards. Last night, I told Daisy how. I felt. She freaked out. I ended up seeing a picture of her with cuts on her lip, so I asked what else she was doing.

Summarize: ok. this is not your fault, but i think i have to rant about this article. i'm gonna give the author reasons 5 (shunning manual labor jobs) and 4 (celebrating the slacker as anti-hero), but 3-1 are complete and utter crap. 3 is crap because, [across the world]( it is common to live with one's parents until marriage. So it can't possibly GenX's fault. And to generalize that the culture of infantilization comes from living at home is post hoc ergo propter hoc. Infantilization is as much a problem as parenting, economic well-being, etc., whereby someone can live at home until they are 30, yet take huge responsibility around the house - thus learning how to be a better adult - depending on what is demanded of them. 2 is crap, because once again the author fails to take numerous factors influencing the entertainment industry into account. For example, many, many, MANY entertainers were abused by their agents and record labels throughout the years. Many were left destitute. That sounds like a broken system from the get go. The music and film industries have become lazy, bloated and corrupt. [That corruption probably loses more money than piracy,]( not to mention the perpetuation of the idea that celebrities deserve a ridiculous amount of money - an amount that if a cardiovascular surgeon requested, he would be laughed at. Additionally, we were not "taught" to believe that entertainment has no value.This is false for two reasons: first, value is market determined. We do pay for things, we just hate paying for bullshit that is crammed down our throats or things that we like that are locked up with DRM. Sell us thing we want without abusive contracts attached, and the entertainment industry will move gracefully into this century. second, paying $19.88 for a CD at Coconuts in 1996 was highway robbery then, and it continues to be now. Copyright law has allowed the major publishers (versus the hardworking artists creating the entertainment) to charge monopoly rents for decades and that is a system that is falling apart, as it should. Finally, 1 is crap, crap, crap. This is just this author's commentary on the explosion of the virtual world and its appeal to everyone. It has nothing to do with GenX, the Babyboomers or anything else. It has to do with parenting plain and simple. You don't want your kid to be glued to the tube? Great, send them to dance class, gymnastics, little league, fencing lessons, whogivesafuck. The problem is that EVERYONE likes the technology and its innovations. So if mommy and daddy sit on the tubes all day, how can they expect that baby wont monkey-see-monkey-do?Summary:
Summarize: To all the forever alone commenters: I was in your shoes not that long ago. I spent way too much time last semester bumming around at home, not meeting anyone or growing at all. But then I realized that I was squandering the short amount of time that I have in college, the period in our adult lives when we have the most freedom and the smallest amount of responsibility. So I said fuck it, I'm going to learn how to meet people and make new friends. It took some time to get over the fear of approaching strangers, but I got better at it. A few months ago I was meeting nobody and not enjoying myself at all, but after changing my outlook from "I'm socially inept and should just accept that fact" to "I'm socially inept but it's within my power to change it", my life has gone from mediocre to downright legendary. The only thing that's keeping you "forever alone" is your own mindset. It doesn't matter if you're ugly or utterly socially incompetent, you have the ability to improve yourself and learn to meet new people. If you'd rather be spending your weekend nights partying instead of surfing the internet, go spend time improving your social skills and making friends. Take it from a CS nerd that spent his adolescence playing video games instead of developing proper social skills. You have the ability to free yourself from the "forever alone" curse. Treat it like an RPG: your charisma stat is absolute shit and the only way to improve it is by starting conversations with everyone.Summary:
Summarize: My freshman year of college, I was invited to an end of the year toga party, at a house called Kingwood, where all the theater and music majors gathered to get smashed. I had never been to a toga party before, and I didn't know that the togas were supposed to be baggy, so I used one of my roommate Natalia's hot pink bedsheets, and she and my best friend Sam spent about half an hour pinning and wrapping it into a slutty little minidress. I had just gotten a spray tan that day (I swear it wasn't orangey or "Jersey Shore"), my hair looked hot as hell, put on two bras and my tits looked fantastic. I put on my cute black 4 inch heels and a black belt, and I looked hot as hell, not gonna lie. Sam did something similar, and she looked amazing. I show up, and the whole party pretty much cheers and gasps, because I'm the only one there in a non-white sheet, looking sexy as hell, and most of the girls were jealous, because they hadn't thought of looking sexy at a toga party. I soon became the Slut of the Night. I got totally wasted, hit the bowl and the bong a couple of times, and went out back to smoke a cigarette. At this point, I'm feeling pretty loose and spacey. I attracted the attention of five guys, one of which I had a huge crush on, and four of which were fellow theater majors who I had most of my classes with and which I was pretty good friends. They were almost as drunk as I was, and I let all of them motorboat me, grab my tits, and smack my ass. I must have flashed about twenty people that night, and I'm sure I made out with and slutted it up with more than five guys, but I can't remember at this point. I don't care what anyone says, I was loving it. I'm a pretty sexual person, so it really didn't phase me. I also met this guy who was really interesting and sweet, and we made out all night. I must have looked so skanky and desperate, but I really didn't give a damn. I'm never the type of person to be a slutty attention whore, but it was the end of the year, I was transferring next year, and I thought fuck it , I'm gonna go hard. It was probably one of the few times in my life where I was loving being single. One of the only disadvantages of having a boyfriend is that I would feel pretty awful doing that nowadays.Summary:
Summarize: lol, it's not the taste you drink for. You drink over a conversation. You drink to loosen up. After a while of following this mantra, you will have become an expert in all things alcoholic so that you will start to drink for taste. Because that taste will become associated with the drunken tomfoolery of your past.Summary:
Summarize: A few years ago I was working as a camp counsellor for poor/troubled kids from inner city LA. One of the kids was evil incarnate. He would threaten other kids, generally disrespect everyone, and for multiple nights in a row try to run away into the woods. All of this culminated in me not getting any sleep for 3-4 nights in a row. Now, the camp was only a week long for his session, but he ended up getting kicked out halfway through after he got in a fight with another camper. However, prior to this, everyone in my cabin was supposed to do a fun tower climb activity. Everyone wanted to do it, including him. It comes time to do the climb though, and he refuses to listen to safety instructions/causing every other camper to not be able to do it. He then proceeds to try to run away (again, into the woods where he would basically die from being miles from nowhere). I tried to reason with him, but he started pushing me and baiting me to do something. After a few minutes, my co-counselor got there and took over, but I've never been closer to hitting a child (he was around 13). I was so shaken by it that I had to go off on my own, at which point I broke down in tears. I was so ready to haul off and cold clock this little shit stain of a kid, and I couldn't believe that I could have even gone that far. It doesn't seem that much, but it made me really think about myself and what kind of man I am.Summary:
Summarize: So i work at a bar in Hollywood and some guys came in for the Golden State game. My buddy, serving them, talked to them about Destiny and whatnot, turns out their client is Activision and they're expecting Destiny 2 to be teased at Sony's conference. That's about as much of concrete details I can give you. So full disclosure, take this with a massive grain of salt. My take: It's hard not to believe them with all we've come to learn recently: -Luke Smith is the rumored head of Destiny 2, and he's tweeted a few times about being in LA for E3. Love that guy. -Rise of Iron was announced via a stream pre-E3. I see the reasoning behind this as one of two options: 1) They were straight up bumped from the conference for any sort of reason. Timing, minimal content compared to other games, etc. 2) Or they're letting the Destiny stage time go to a tease for Destiny 2. I doubt we'll get a playable demo onstage for RoI, what with it only an expansion and essentially the same game. So if there's any stage time, it's going to a Destiny 2. Probs just a vid, don't wanna steal too much thunder from RoI. -RoI is only $30. This isn't bad, but with such a price tag we can probably expect less content than TTK. Thus I'm highly doubting RoI will carry us over a year (he'll I'm hoping it won't). So a Spring 2017 release is looking more and more likely. With that, it's highly possible Year 3 may be short for us, with Bungie opting to kickstart Year 4 early with D2 in spring. Just a thought. But yea,Summary:
Summarize: Possibly adrenalin-mediated vasoconstriction? That would explain a significantly diminished blood loss/volume depletion from what appears to be a rather big abdominal wound.Summary:
Summarize: I'm a PhD student in a specialized field of electrical engineering right now, and let me tell you, it's not all it's cracked up to be. I've spent my whole life dreaming of this exact spot where I am, and it's exactly the opposite of what I thought it would be. I'm sure some of you out there are familiar with this, but let me just say it to be clear: Every decision I've made since high school was to get here. Tens of thousands of dollars (yes, you read that right) have been spent by me, my parents, and the Canadian federal government to get me here. It's mind-boggling to think that I've spent the last 20 years in school... all in vain. It is incredibly frustrating. I've studied the newest manufacturing processes. I've studied bleeding-edge microrobotics. Hell, I even took a course or two in nuclear engineering. And still, I find myself lacking motivation. The dissonance involved in going to work is soul-shattering. I go through highs and lows: Some days, I think I might find this niche, this little spot of expertise that appeals to me, that I could make it mine, the way my colleagues seem to have done. But then I find that "nobody's interested in that", which, of course, leads back to funding problems. Don't get me wrong, I really enjoy the studying and the classes and learning about technologies that the common public won't see for another 10 years, if ever. But I know that can't last forever, and it's high time I move to the next level and make some technology of my own. As my Dad would say, it's time to shit or get off the pot. Argh. So here I sit, 4:25 AM, unable to sleep because I face the prospect of another semester of evading my boss and struggling through high-level electrical engineering classes (I'm a mechanical engineer, actually, I was accepted to this department by a bunch of fancy hand-waving). It makes me wonder, what would I be good at? My Dad used to be a high school teacher, back when dinosaurs ruled the earth, and I've always thought I had a particular gift for teaching. No, I can't do that, high-school teachers get paid next to nothing and their curriculum is at the mercy of the provincial government. What about actually doing what mechanical engineers are supposed to do? I spent one summer working as a Research Assistant in an R&D lab, and HOLY CRAP did I have fun. I came back and asked my professors how I would go about doing that for a living, and they told me I'd need a PhD. Back to square one. I despise the thought of being a CAD monkey, I tried that once. The boredom nearly killed me. It was like living in a Dilbert strip, without the humor. At this point, I'm open to wild suggestions. Surprise me. I'm looking for that light-bulb idea that I've never even dreamed of, and who knows, maybe you could change my life. I'd like to mention that right now, I'm living in Atlantic Canada, frozen wasteland that it is, and 90% of my family lives here too. I know it limits my career opportunities, and I'm not completely averse moving. Hell, I might even consider moving back to the States, for the right money (I got my MSc in the US). I've recently met a girl who might be the one, who knows, and I don't think she particularly cares for this little corner of Canada, either. So, put those batshit-crazy ideas into little pixel form and send 'em my way. I'm very quickly running out of ideas of my own.Summary:
Summarize: All vice prohibitions are great for the prison-industrial complex and great for organized crime, while at the same time being horrible for everyone else. Laws against victimless pleasures simply create victims by driving an unstoppable variety of commerce into the black market. Whatever public health problems drugs may actually pose, criminal justice responses are never even slightly effective as solutions. American drug laws transform millions of harmless and basically decent people into adversaries of law enforcement. They also channel many billions of dollars in consumer spending away from legitimate businesses and into the hands of criminal syndicates. Actual vice participation is generally shaped by cultural forces, with even the most draconian regimes having minimal impact. China continues to execute large numbers of opium traffickers in any given week because even their brutal extremism cannot eradicate the demand for opium. There is no way to "fight hard enough" to defeat a vice through violence. Worse still, to the extent that there are real public health problems related to drugs; harm reduction strategies are profoundly undermined by the covert nature of black market commerce. Addicts often do not seek treatment for fear of social and professional consequences that may follow from admitting that a problem exists in the first place. Secrecy prevents charitable organizations from having an effective outreach as well. Sensible lifesaving measures like needle exchanges are difficult to fund and implement because narrow-minded moralists become outraged at any tolerance for illegal activity. Also, in a post-prohibition environment, the availability of reliable doses of uncontaminated supplies would do wonders to reduce the health problems posed by various forms of recreational drug use. The number of people injured or killed in violence related to drug law enforcement is only the tip of the iceberg -- beneath the surface lurks the legions of fatalities and countless escalating addictions because of the uncertainty involved in supplies of "street drugs" vs. the sort of well-regulated production and labeling standards one sees with alcohol distribution. Then there is the financial matter. Of course a paradigm shift would save enormous amounts of public funds while also providing a new revenue stream in the form of taxes on previously illegal commerce. The economy would be dramatically stimulated with perhaps as many as 1 million consumers and potential workers are liberated from prisons and permitted to rejoin society. Since secrecy is the primary component of cost for drugs, prices would plummet. This would have the secondary effect of virtually eradicating that component of property crime caused by addicts in need of a fix.Summary:
Summarize: I did this exact thing when they called me - I was bored and had played around for about 45 minutes. Originally he had got me to the eventviewer by spelling it out, e for egg, v for vision etc. I started having 'issues' and started spellling out the errors to him - f for foxtrot, u for uniform, c for charlie etc. I told him to suck my dick, eat my ass in the same way before he passed me off to his manager. His manager hung up fairly quickly. The kicker? The first guy who was too thick to pick up on what i was doing FUCKING CALLED BACK TO ABUSE ME! I shit you not. I remained calm and told him how much fun I had with him, he asked me to suck his dick, I said I'd love that because he sounds like a pretty boy. He was fucking furious, it was beautiful. I love the nerve of the asshole, calling back a potential target for wasting his precious time.Summary:

"orange". then i would show her a yellow cup and ask her what color it was. "yellow". i would then pour the orange juice into the cup and "WALAH" they were the same color! my mom fell for that trick every time.Summary:
Summarize: I was in Atlantic City for my friends 21st birthday. He got obliviously drunk so I decided I was going to do my own thing, play the games I want and not deal with him. This is after I told myself that I would NEVER attend another 21st birthday because its the same bullshit over and over. So I bounce and play some craps. Im shooting dice well and I get a call from him, I pick up and he asks "Should I buy coke?" And of course I say "yes" and he tells me to go back to the room. So I run upstairs, run down the hallway, open the door to the room to find my friend and 2 random, thug ass, black dudes with crazy jewelry on. Now these dudes towered myself and my buddy by inches and Im 6 ft tall. So I act cool and buy some blow. I questioned the quality of the blow and their tone of voice became very aggressive and they became very jumpy. The guy holding then took out a credit card and shoveled this coke up my nose. It tasted terrible and was cleary cut with dog shit and didnt get me high, especially with the amount they jammed up my nose. Just to get them out if my face we bought a gram for $60 snd they got out of there. Before they left, they questioned my earrings. I told them they were purchased at Walmart for 12.99, which they were, and he grilled them sooooo hard. I thought he was gonna start robbing us. They would have gotten away with it, too. Then we blew the dawg shit coke, trying to convince ourselves that it wasnt beat. So then my friend locked his wallet in the room lock box, and wasnt able to open it for an hour, due to the fact ge kept putting in the wrong pin code. Thats when I left him alone in the room and I went back to the craps table.Summary:
Summarize: When you are on birth control, you don't have normal periods - you have a withdrawal bleed caused by a dip in hormones. Hormones, particularly estrogen, can be stored in fat. So if you have been on birth control, your body has likely stored away excess hormones in your fat cells. Now that you are losing weight, your body is breaking down fat cells and using them for energy, thereby metabolizing the stored hormones and keeping your body from having a noticeable enough drop in hormones to keep you from having a withdrawal bleed.Summary:
Summarize: Ok, so I have this sex swing, or should I say had... I recently moved, and threw all of my belongings into boxes. To get rid of clutter I had a few boxes of stuff I don't use anymore that I filled, drove to Goodwill and donated. Well, after unpacking and searching for the aforementioned sex swing, I discovered it wasn't there. After frantically searching and thinking, I realized that I must have accidentally, somehow, fucked up and put it in a box to donate. I only got to use it a couple of times, and now some kid is probably enjoying it for all the wrong reasons in a backyard play set. One man's trash...Summary:
Summarize: I have played all of the Ticket to Rides many times. My favorite is the Nordic Countries map, but it only plays 2 or 3 players. India is my second favorite, because of the Mandala rules and it seems like there are more difficult decisions to make (haven't really analyzed why this is, just seems that way to me). Europe is my third favorite. Between Europe and US, I much prefer Europe. US is actually my least favorite map, even after adding the 1910 changes. I think the reason I don't like the US map is that aggressive card drawing rarely pays off (maybe I am doing it wrong). The other games, depending on how the game flows, sometimes it is correct to draw a bunch of routes and sometimes it is better not too. With the US map, I feel that this strategic option isn't really there.Summary:
Summarize: Most awesome place was this, not really because of the location, more the situation: My ex-GFs family used to live in a huge >120 years old mansion (europe).I was like 21, she 18. One day she took me to underneath the rooftop, where the rooms of the servants used to be, better, still were, as they were pretty much left untouched, just cleaned frequently and used for guests from time to time. So we walk into one of these rooms, you can breath the history, the old bed in there, actually part of the wall, is freshly made. As if I would need to get a inspiration for that thought, she tells me something about me being the master secretly visiting the young maid stealing her virginity and here we go. It was incredible as it was the only time in my life (yet) during any kind of role play that I really felt like it was real. So it was basically my best historical sex and one of the best in my history.Summary:
Summarize: I live with a guy who has these moments all the time. When he's in panic he shouts some sort of expletive (fuck, shit, bollocks) normally as loud as he can, and either makes a swift but loud exit or keeps on standing there, swearing. Whether he's forgot to watch his dinner cooking or thinks hes lost his bus ticket, he will always go crazy. Sometimes, I think to myself what it might be like to live life through his eyes, maybe it would make my boring and average world a bit more exciting.Summary:
Summarize: Sharing things on Reddit (and the internet in general) can be hard. Some people react so strongly and negatively, like the people calling your family a piece of shit. They are your family. You've eloquently spoken of your unconditional love for your dad. You might not do things the same way he does, but you accept him for who he is. There are some people who post, who legitimately dislike their families. Those people probably agree with the comments that their families are shit or whatever. Then there are posters like you, who commented that your dad was quirky, gave a description of part of his personality that fit in context with the question being asked, and made it clear that you love your family very much. Those people, the ones who love their families, don't want to hear the judgment of others who have a small piece of a big picture. The cruelty and judgment is hurtful and makes it difficult to post openly, seriously, and honestly in the future. I admire your unconditional love and acceptance of your father for who he is. I don't think he sounds like a piece of shit. He sounds quirky and free-spirited. He sounds like the kind of guy you could have an interesting conversation with or someone you could watch and see a different world view than your own. I don't think your step-mom or whatever you call her sounds like a doormat. She sounds like an amazing, loving, open-minded individual. You are lucky to have people like that in your life from whom you can learn so much. They might not do things the way you do, but they give you a different perspective on life.Summary:
Summarize: I'm using MAS 200 (the MAS 200 sub had been dormant for 2 years tho), but I've been told that MAS 200 and Sage 100 are pretty much the same? Anyways, we're using MAS 200, and I've been trying a few things to get UPS Worldship to write back the tracking number, freight cost, and weight to the invoice in MAS. I got UPS to write an elaborate script for a product of theirs called Crossware. After processing a shipment in Worldship, Crossware will go through a lengthy keystroke macro in order to alt-tab to the Shipping Data Entry window and copy-paste the order number in, then tab a certain number of times to copy-paste in the freight cost, and so on with the tracking numbers. The problem being, the macro is "blind", if the cursor isn't in the correct position before the macro starts, then it will paste things in the wrong fields and generally bug out and close the window. Basically it's totally hokey and over the last few months about 1/3rd of the orders end up not getting invoiced from the shipping terminal. Then just the other day I tried Ship Gear, and it's certainly less hokey, but it's limited in that it can only put the tracking number and freight cost in a /c comment line on the sales order, then we would have to manually copy-paste the freight in the correct box in order to bill the customer.Summary:
Summarize: I respectfully disagree. If you provide facts and cited accounts of something that is controversial and don't resort to name-calling or poor debate skills, any topic will be upvoted and discussed appropriately. However, half the people ballsy enough to actually present dissenting viewpoints on popular subjects are usually uneducated, douche bags, or utilize only an elementary to intermediate level of skill when it comes to having a proper debate. There are countless subjects on which we, as a collective, have sided with one group, but as soon as more (and accurate) information surfaces, we amend our viewpoint. This is not the case for Fox News. They do not apologize. They do not admit error or wrongdoing. They blatantly lie, constantly, and then hide it. Reddit doesn't try to have some sort of overarching political agenda. Most of us are just geeks who want to understand our world better, learn how to improve our lives and the lives of those around us, and get a few good laughs at vuvuzelas and kittens. There are little to no dissenting opinions on Fox News. They hide information. They cut videos to suit their needs (not saying they're the only ones, but saying "omg but they do it too!" is not a reasonable excuse). They have convinced themselves that they are the only "unbiased" news source in America. It's disgusting. I know I am not speaking for all redditors, as I can only speak for myself and a few others I know, but we are definitely open to change if you can support your position. Few people can do more than provide anecdotes, and then they get pissy because we don't suddenly agree with them. That's not how it works. Let's say you still disagree, and that there are certain topics you think Redditors are completely biased on. In that case, provide the sources, do research, provide links, and help us understand the opposing viewpoint in a clear, concise, and tactful manner. Help improve the community rather than just saying "oh, well, I don't like this place, but I don't want to put in the effort to improve it." Such an opportunity would never be granted by the media that is Fox News.Summary:
Summarize: My boss does this crap all the time. He gets payed 30 grand a year to provide desktop support and a further 40 to do app dev work (which he doesn't do at all), but has gotten into the position where a few of us part time students can do all that work for him. Needless to say, we don't cover all hours of the day (which he does and is responsible for)... and are on extremely restricted schedules due to school. He has no idea what is actually going on with desktop support and constantly hounds us about tickets that were closed hours before because he doesn't actually click the refresh button. Lately he has been taking off 9+ days a month to "work from home" where he occasionally sends messages to us about work we've already done to feel like he's still in control. He also goes swimming for an hour or two every day and attends meetings that have nothing to do with his job most of the rest of the time. <3 bosses.Summary:

Summarize: This is mostly a rant, but I would appreciate any input, advice, or general observations about the situation. During a recent visit to her school's open house/freshmen orientation, my sister managed to describe several people as "creepy". First, we were swimming in our hotel's pool. We were the only two people in the pool, though there were two other women sunning themselves next to it, when a fat bald man walked into the pool area. My sister shot me a look, which I interpreted as "Oh well, it was fun to have the pool to ourselves for a while." I shrugged and we continued to bob up and down in the water, gossiping and comparing our complexions. The man who'd just entered took off his shoes and shirt, put on a pair of goggles, and proceeded to swim up and down the length of the pool. We'd been in the pool for maybe an hour anyways, so when my sister said she wanted to leave I figured she was just done with the water. But as we were walking back to our room she says, "Can you believe how creepy that guy was?" No, I could not believe his creepiness, because I hadn't noticed it, he was just using the pool (just like us!). "But Moxiecontin, he was a fat bald guy, and he was wearing goggles ! That's so creepy!" She giggled and I made some faces but did not continue the conversation, I wanted this to be a fun trip with no drama (and she's 18, she hasn't quite mastered thinking before she speaks). But then we were at a restaurant for dinner, and she feels the need to point out a man sitting by himself at the bar. "Look at that guy" she says, "So creepy! Who sits by themselves at the bar?" I shushed her (didn't want him to hear her!), and theorized that maybe he was hungry and didn't want to take up a whole table or booth. "Yeah, but only creepy people have to eat at restaurants alone , he should just by some ramen." I asked her if she would rather be eating ramen than the (fairly) tasty mexican food we were enjoying, and she just stuck her tongue out at me and the conversation moved on. At about 11pm that night we were hitting the hotel's vending machines, filling up on snacks and soda, when a man walked past the alcove where the machines are. I caught his eye over the pile of soda cans in my arms and he greeted us, while he continued walking, with a "How y'all doing tonight?" "Doin' great!" I replied, brandishing my sugary treasure at him, "Aw, that's nice" he said, never having stopped walking or saying anything bad. My sister turns to me and says, "Holy shit that was so fucking creepy!" Now, this was not a creepy exchange. We live in the south, where if you make unexpected eye contact with someone it's okay (and often demanded) that you politely acknowledge it. I told her that there was nothing "creepy" about that, he was just saying hello. He didn't even stop! But I was wrong, he was creepy because he was wearing a striped tank top and shorts that showed his knees. So in the course of five hours she'd picked out three strangers and gone into detail about why they were creepy. Of course, the next morning it starts again. The man using the waffle machine before us? "Whoa, creepy". I didn't even bother with that one, but I think he could hear her. But then a new development! Women can be creepy too! While I checked us out she stood outside next to the cigarette butt dispenser puffing away on her new bad habit, and another woman came outside and did the same thing. She was middle-aged and thin, and I said hello to her as I collected my sister and headed to the car. "That old lady was creepy" she says once she closes her door. "Why, did she say something to you?" "No, she just stood there and smoked" EXACTLY LIKE YOU WERE?! I pointed that out, and she laughed and said, "Yeah, but I'm not like that." Once at the school she used the word several more times, usually to describe why she didn't want to sit in a particular area during the presentations. "No, that guy looks creepy" "No! That girl's got a wolf on her shirt, she's fucking creepy " "Oh god, that guy's dad is wearing overalls, what a creepy family, we can't sit next to them!" I just tuned it out. On the drive home she even called a passenger in another car creepy! Besides her labeling of other people as "creepy", we had a great time. I generally enjoy her company, and she's a very bright girl with an awesome future ahead of her. She received a "full ride" to the fantastic private university of her choice, and she's talented beyond belief! She has a large group of friends, and a smaller group of really great friends, and things just generally seem perfect for her. But I'm worried that her quickness to put strangers down is going to hurt her in the future, especially starting school without anyone she knows going with her. I'm also starting to think of her as annoying, and I don't want to think badly of my own sister.Summary:
Summarize: This didn't happen today but rather on the fourth of July. To preface: My friends and I have gone to the beach with one of my friend's family the week of the fourth every summer during highschool. This year was our last year so we decided to put on a big fireworks show on the beach for the fourth. We decide to go all out, and when its all said and done we end up with $868 worth of mortars. And now the fuck up: On the fourth we take all of the fireworks out to the beach for our grand show. we start out by shooting one or two mortars at a time, and quickly progress to four or five at a time. As we shoot off more and more, we start to draw an increasingly larger crowd. At this point I have the genius idea to shoot off nine mortars at a time. What could possibly go wrong? We load all of the tubes, twist the fuses together and I light them up. There are eight simaltaneous expolsions as eight mortars streak into the sky. Unfortunantly the nineth had a longer fuse, and got knocked over by the other eight blasts. It fell pointing straight at the croud of 40 or so people watching. time slowed and I helplessly watched as the mortar shotts straight at the crowd of people, and hits my friend's 8 year old sister as it explodes. There is a deafening boom, flames and fire erupt, and people scream and run. When the smoke clears, we find the girl who got hit. Thankfully she is OK, but our fireworks show is called to a halt and the girl's mother gives me the stink eye the rest of the trip.Summary:
Summarize: I just got home from a 6 hour drive from Washington to Oregon and I only stopped once to go pee. so I had to shit extremely bad. I get home and as soon as I open the door I start taking my pants and my boxers off. I run to the hallway and then I notice my mother and father grabbing their TV I had borrowed. My penis hanging out them looking at me with TV in hand I run to my kitchen while they leave and I don't know if I should talk to them.Summary:
Summarize: I was raped. I haven't told anyone IRL. We've been together off and on for about four years, for SOME UNKNOWN REASON I've been depressed for about as long. He's never been very good to me, but he was under my skin. You know how it is. We had lots of consensual sex, including BDSM stuff which might blur the line for most people, but for me its crystal clear. When "No" doesn't mean No, you have another word that does. Continuing sexual contact after someone has used their safe word is just unacceptable. Anyhoo, one day when I'm going through a "rough patch" (re: suicidal, and he knew it) I was over at his place, and we were hanging out and things turned sexual. I said no, I said my safe word, I couldn't fight him off, I knew he liked it when I fight. So I lay still, closed my eyes and waited for it to be over. He hurt me so I would fight again. He grabbed and twisted my breast until I felt some of the tissue tear. I stayed as quiet and still as I could, knowing that he hates "dead fish" girls. He eventually finished. I asked him to drive me home, he refused. He said he would drive me to the station tomorrow morning. I grabbed my phone, and the last bus was coming in ten minutes, I could make it if I hurried... Anyone who knows anything about dangerous animals know what a bad idea it is to move quickly, and I had forgotten about being still and quiet in my haste. He grabbed me just as I'd finished getting dressed. Threw me down, and did it again. Seeing my mistake, in as flat and even a tone as possible I told him to stop, red, dishwasher, anything, he ignored me again. By the time he was done I'd obviously missed the last bus. I asked him again, told him I couldn't stay here, he told me leaving was "not an option." So I called a friend to pick me up. I did not tell my friend why, he came anyway cause he's awesome. My friend does not like the guy I was seeing, and when I didn't tell him he assumed we had gotten into a fight. I didn't have any facial bruising this time, (lol I'm an idiot) so it couldn't have been that bad right? As much as I love my friend, he spent the ride home berating me for hanging out with that guy. And that hurt too. I didn't cry that night, nor have I since. About a week or so later, after hearing nothing from him, I deleted him off all social media. I still have his number in my phone because I would really like to know its him and deciding wither to answer or not. A bit over a month passed, and no monthly visitor. Uh-oh. I'm on birth control, but you hear horror stories all the time. So I got a test, and sure enough, despite the IUD one little sucker had managed to implant and it was positive. Fuck. I couldn't have an abortion, I had had one a few years ago an had promised myself it would be the last. And yet it was probably a rape baby, and I DO NOT want those psychopathic genes spread. The next day I started bleeding. I am no fucking grateful that nature took its course and I did not have to make the choice. He hasn't called or texted me or anything. This is someone who claims to love me, then raped and ignored me. Why is the thing I can't seem to get passed that he is ignoring me? I'm ridiculously stuck on it. I haven't tried to get a hold of him since a few days after the "indecent", but somehow him not calling really hurts. From his perspective I was suicidal, he raped me, and he hasn't heard anything from me since a few days later.Summary:
Summarize: So there's this wonderful girl i met she is 24, i'm 30 male (relationship length is 7 weeks), and we hit things off the first time we hung out. So we've been seeing each other twice a week, as schedules allow. And so after 7 weeks of being totally into each other. I decided to get this bright idea to add her on facebook. Well her little brother sees me as a friend on her fb profile, and calls her out on it. And he tells her that he's met me before at a party, and he doesn't think too positively of me, and must've badmouthed me. At the party i behaved, didnt do anything untowards and had a fun time, yet he acts like he saw me doing something heinous. Which is madness, i guess hanging out with friends and having a drink is illegal. So I asked her what do you believe, and she said she's seen my actions, but now she's stressed that her brother doesn't like me. I asked her does she want me to stop calling her, she said no, do you want to unfriend on facebook, she said no. She asked me what i'm looking for i said possibly long term, so I asked her what she's looking for she said she entered it with an open heart, and open mind. So i said do you want a fling/short term? She said no, long term would be preferred. I haven't disrespected her brother, and she says she cares for me, i told her to have a day to think about the situation. And at least tell me what's going on. All her replies are when I've asked her, so if i'm a good guy, and your brother is being a brother and being overprotective, I want to know where we are at or what's going on, she says "I don't know". How can you not verbalize what the I don't know means? That's crazy!Summary:
Summarize: So I was adding a video card and new power supply to my old setup (yes its a premade, I know, I know) and realized that my case was too cramped, so I "moved that shit" to a larger case. However, I seem to have run into a problem. I actually do not exactly know where the motherboard hookups (HDD light, reset switch, power switch, "SPEAKER"). I'm currently using the motherboard that comes default with the P7-1132 (model is AAHD3-HB). Does anyone have any advice for this, or maybe an online manual (I've looked for an online manual. The physical manual is no longer with me). Thanks in advance r/TechSupport (or not, whichever is more applicable.)Summary:
Summarize: I've been sick this week and was planning on not going in to work til I stopped feeling like crud. Silly me, right? Tuesday rolls around, my cellphone buzzes me awake. My boss is telling me that the websites and email and printing are down, oh noooo! I walk him through resetting our win2k3 server. He actually manages to mess it up twice, I don't even know, it resets the same as any PC in the office. The websites come up, hooray! Email and printing are still down, boo! I tell him I'll come in to look at it on Wednesday. I get at least 4 more calls for things that can be fixed with a functioning brain. Wednesday rolls around, I'm waiting outside for 20 minutes before he shows up to unlock. He takes me to a computer to show me the problem. He opens up our accounting software, tries to print, and it spits out an error. Report files could not be accessed. While he's showing me, he tells me how he ran some diagnostics himself and had to enter a captcha for our email and he thinks that's the problem. He opens a sales order and clicks "email", another error occurs trying to convert the order into a PDF. Report files could not be accessed. There's two ways to convert a sales order into a PDF. One involves clicking "export" and then clicking "as PDF." The other involves clicking "email" and then closing the dialog box that pops up asking for the email address to send it to. My boss does the latter. In his mind, not being able to print in a single program and not being able to convert an order into a PDF by clicking "email" means "email and printing are both down." I should have realized this sooner, I guess. The best part? It's ONLY on this computer that it's happening. These functions work fine on 5 out of 6 office PCs. When I explained to him that the problem was that this PC was losing access to the network share that has the accounting report templates, he says to me, "Then why did I have to type in that Chinese garbage on our email?"Summary:
Summarize: It's not absurd. It's a matter of principle. Do you think when Empire Strikes Back came out, it'd be okay to run down the streets yelling "VADER IS LUKE'S FATHER!! HAHA!"? The answer is no. As viewers that have the luxury of keeping up to date with shows/movies, we should respect other people that don't have this luxury. You can be excited all you want, but in the Prof's case, instead of posting this shit to the entire class, why not go ask, "Oh hey, have you seen last week's episode of BB? Yeah? Cool! Let's discuss our excitement!" - IMO, this is what the teacher should be doing, instead of literally, ruining the show for, potentially, many people. The feelings that we had when watching that episode were immense; they were great; they were what us humans love to feel in our lives. Do you really want to prevent another person from feeling these awesome things by spoiling shit for them? Your mentality is no better than the trolls that lurk through Reddit and post random spoilers in the most random of thread. So, to avoid you saying "but again, what's the timeframe?",Summary:
Summarize: I should probably post this in /r/Ihaveissues) Here's my extensive list: 1st date: (both of us 16) (This wasn't technically a relationship but it explains future ones.) Mr. Quarterback - 5'11", blonde, blue-eyed All American Boy. I was kind of an ugly duckling, so when my braces came off and I got a padded bra, I was thrilled to be going out with my long-time crush. He got handsy and I told him I wasn't going to give it up. The following Monday, he told the entire school that the reason he didn't get in my pants was because I stunk and had crabs. This was also the week in Biology that we studied crustaceans. This completely altered my high school experience. 1st BF: (both of us 16) Best Bud - 6'3" and Blonde. After my disastrous 1st date, I disappeared into myself and ended up hanging out with a group of goofy boys. Best Bud was sort of a loser and had a crush on me. I figured I was out of his league but he made me laugh and I didn't think he'd ever spread ugly rumors about me. <- teenage girl logic. He turned out to be a psychotic, insecure, controlling cheating liar (including a suicide attempt). I got pregnant at 17, married and divorced him at 18, married him again at 20, another child at 21, divorced again at 23. 2nd Husband: Okay. This is where it gets interesting. (Both of us 23) One-Armed Man - 5'9", looks like Macauly Culkin. After years of trying to leave my marriage, I made the drastic decision to cheat. My 1st husband always said if I ever cheated on him or if I'd even had sex before him that he would want nothing to do with me ever again. This sounded like the best news to me so I made a plan that included new underwear. I went out for my 23rd birthday with some gfs of mine and ran into the One-Armed Man. I'd known him for years, even before he lost his arm and had always thought he was cute. I was one Long Island Ice Tea in when I looked him straight in the eyes and asked him, "you want me don't you?". He said yes so we went and fucked in his car. That's about all we had in common. He was a hunter, obsessed with it, even. I am not and we didn't work out. Divorce... Marriage.... Divorce... Younger Man: (me: 25, him: 19) Mr. Unfriendzoned - 6'2", skinny balding brunette with blue eyes. Ian Somerhalder-y. After my final divorce, I decided to give up on relationships. I was sharing a big house with my oldest friend who'd also just gotten divorced. We both waited tables and tended bar, I babysat her daughter while she worked nights and she picked mine up from school/daycare in the afternoons. We had a pretty good set up. One day, she got her ex-bro-in-law hired as the dishwasher at the restaurant where we worked. He had just gotten out of the brig for possession so he also needed a place to stay. We rented a room out back to him and I became his ride. I already knew the kid through my bestie's ex-husband so it was cool. He was cute and he cracked me up and I admittedly enjoyed his crush on me. He talked me into smoking pot and we'd get high before work. Soon, our time spent together became more flirty and touchy and his persistence (arguably) paid off. We were best friends and lovers for close to 4 years after and are still friends. He was young, I was (am) immature. We had good times. Some drama unfolded during our relationship though. Turns out, while he was in the brig, his ex who lives in Alaska sent him a picture of an ultrasound and Mr. Unfriendzoned's parents were in the middle of a custody battle for the child. His parents won custody but soon after, moved the entire family about 12 hours away. Mr. Unfriendzoned had to go too. (longer story) White Knight: (me: 29, him: 31) Juicebox - 5"9', blonde, green eyes, muscles. Ugh....mistakes happen when you're depressed. Shortly after Mr. Unfriendzoned left, I found myself unemployed and sinking into depression. A friend of my mom's called me about applying for a job where she worked and also mentioned a single guy who worked with her. I told her it was cool to give him my number and within a week, I had a boyfriend and a job. Juicebox completely swept me off my feet...he might as well have been wearing a cape. He was all abercrombie-looking and it was obvious that he worked out. He made lots of money and took me on weekend getaways that included massages, tattoos, food and drinks...spoiled more than my trashy-ass could imagine. He was from another state, though and that made my controlling mother nervous. Since having children at a young age and being such a flibbertygibbit, I relied on my parents' support. My mother in particular, has an opinion on every single detail of my life and no matter what I'm doing, I should be doing something else. She means well, but I could never have gotten her approval, especially on my parenting skills. Anyway, while I was piecing my life back together with my new job and boyfriend, my mother was plotting with my ex-husband. She was scared that I would move 5 hours away with my 2 kids so she told my ex that she'd speak for him in court if he would file custody papers. At the time, I had a house a few doors down from my parents. My dad had co-signed the loan and they'd helped me out with a few payments before I'd started working again. Without going into too many more issues, let's just say that the idea of going to court against my mother was more than I thought I could take. I signed the custody papers without a fight and the next week when my parents' lawyer called me, I also signed over the deed to my house. Now homeless and childless, I moved 5 hours away with the Juicebox after knowing him for 3 months. The juicebox turned out to be a roid-raged liar and cheater. Online Bf #1: (Both of us 30) I'll call him The One because I've referenced him as that in other posts - 5'9" brunette, blue eyes. I saw The One holding a guitar in his profile pic on match.com and of course I had to contact him. We had the most perfect relationship: Talked online everyday, all day long, saw each other most weekends (he lives an hour away), our kids seemed to get along really well and he plays guitar!! I always had the feeling that he wouldn't like me when I'm angry. He is patient to a fault and a super responsible single father. He's also the cute, nerdy type that I have a soft spot for. He made a wall out of my name in Minecraft. <3 Everything was perfect until he "invited" my children and I on vacation with him and his kids. (I made a rage comic about it: please excuse all the "le"s used. I made it a while back) The day after we returned from vacation, he said, we "handle stress differently" and dumped me. This relationship has been the hardest for me to get over, I think, because The One is basically imaginary. Since we were a LDR, we didn't have to deal with each others' annoying habits. We didn't get tired of each other so it kind of made him unfairly perfect in my book. Online BF #2: (me: 32, him: 34) The Mighty Oak - 6'6", curly mustache, tattoos, gauged out ears. This poor, huge fella. Within a week of The One dumping me, I got laid off and slipped off into another depression. I was out of town getting a 13 tattooed, when The Mighty Oak, who's also a tattoo artist, contacted me on okcupid.com. An hour later, I got a job offer from a restaurant called The Black Cat...it all seemed like some kind of black fate to me so of course, I jumped on him. Literally. On our first date, I told him that I was wondering if I would be able to wrap my legs all the away around him...turns out, I could. I feel like, in retrospect, that I was like a tiny hurricane headed straight for him and he was weird enough to look forward to it. At one point, I said, "this is a bad idea but how about I move in with you and work in your studio?" and he agreed to it. Obviously, he has issues too. Three months into our relationship, The Mighty Oak hurt his back and it was up to me to take care of bills, home, cooking, children, and all the other stress that comes with being an adult. I broke. The Mighty Oak wasn't the sweetest of patients and I am no caretaker. We crashed into each other and didn't have any foundation. It seemed like we handled stress about the same way so I had to leave. We were both pretty ugly to each other. So that's my wall o'boyfriends. Hope this answered OP's question.Summary:

Summarize: When you are on birth control, you don't have normal periods - you have a withdrawal bleed caused by a dip in hormones. Hormones, particularly estrogen, can be stored in fat. So if you have been on birth control, your body has likely stored away excess hormones in your fat cells. Now that you are losing weight, your body is breaking down fat cells and using them for energy, thereby metabolizing the stored hormones and keeping your body from having a noticeable enough drop in hormones to keep you from having a withdrawal bleed.Summary:

Summarize: A friend left my house with another friend. He left his car in my driveway. A couple of other buddies were at my house and suggested we take his car and go jump it over the railroad track. There was a dirt road that had a railroad track at the top of a hill. There was a rapid drop off on the other side, so you could get considerable air. "Ok," I say and we head out. We jump it a few times before the car's transmission goes out. The car would only go in reverse. We back the car back home in reverse. We were miles from my house and we even had to back it down main street. We put it in the exact spot we found it. The friend comes back, says his good-byes and gets in his car to go home. Shortly, he comes in the house furious. "The jerk sold me a lemon! I've only had the car a week and now it's leaking transmission fluid!" It was extremely hard for us to keep a straight face. Before anyone calls us jerks, the car wasn't worth much and we got it all fixed up. I told him about it 10 or so years later. Man, that was a fun day.Summary:
Summarize: When I was about 12 years old I decided to set up a tent in the backyard and camp there with my sister. Now, behind the fence of the back of the backyard is a football field, soccer field and tennis courts as well as a parking lot. Around 2 or 3 in the morning, shortly after going to bed, a car pulled up and started creaking. Needless to say, a couple was going at it in the car, and me and my sister's reaction? Throw rocks at the car! 8D That didn't stop them though (it they even freaking noticed), but eventually they finished and drove away and me and the sis went to bed in the tent.Summary:
Summarize: Lately I've been trying to add recent opponents of even matches...only to be ignored a majority of the time. Even with good intentions, the hero emotes ("Well played", "Sorry") typically come off as sarcastic or rude. When someone leaves a game, they generally jump directly into the next one, ascribing salty intentions to friend requests from recently played. This leads me to believe that this feature could use some improvements. I believe there should be a feature that would allow you to message your most recent opponent - if nothing else but to show that you have good intentions. I understand that this could be easily abused by the more toxic portion of the community. This could be easily solved by adding an "ignore" button in chats with people you have recently played with.Summary:
Summarize: This will probably get buried at this point but whatever. here you go but I think I was most influenced in my teen years by bands like Venom, Bathory and Burzum. I didnt get along with anyone else in school and was just like "fuck it" and I think I started dressing that way to annoy everyone as much as possible because they were all a bag of small town dicks. THEN as you get a bit older and you see all of the 40 year old women trying to desperately cling to their gothic youth with their piercings that are now sagging and their stupid pyramid stud belts you wake up and think "I dont want to be that creepy old bitch hanging out with teenage goth kids" and you get your shit together. I took the metal out of my face and the ring in my septum big enough to fit a golf tee through, bleached my hair to white and enrolled in university. You just GROW OUT of it. If you dont grow out of it theres something wrong with you. unless youre a big black metal fan in which case fuck it, you can pull that shit off forever. Still love black metal, but now I enrich my life and step out there with glorious tunes by bands like passenger of shit and in a few more years Ill be rocking a PHD.Summary:

Summarize: Hopefully this doesn't get too long since I usually ramble on lol* I'm 33, born male. Had anxiety/depression/body image issues since puberty. Finally realized this past few months I'm trans and everything suddenly makes sense and my panic attacks stopped and I'm feeling more social and happy even when presenting male. Also quit drinking finally. Wanted to see a therapist for years for those issues and alcoholism but the anxiety preventing me. Now however I had my first therapy session yesterday and have another on Monday with the same therapist and have another therapist scheduled next Saturday to see which I like better. This is too important for me to let my anxiety prevent me from transitioning! Ok that's a quick background. Now all this has made me also think about my sexuality, although technically I've always been thinking about this but now that hopefully I can start exploring my sexually now that I feel comfortable with myself and my body (or will once I'm transitioning). By definition I know I'm bi since sexually I'm attracted to men and woman. I want to have sex with women (haven't yet), but also want to give oral to a guy and receive anal (I do enjoy using toys). Also unrelated to that I now I realize why I also usually identify with the female in porn I watch lol Anyway sexually I like everything. However physically and emotionally I'm only attracted to women (cis/trans). My porn preferences were usually lesbian or transgender porn. I sometimes did watch gay porn but they had to be really feminine and twinkish and it had to be really sexual. If they talked a lot or it was more about making out it did nothing for me so I usually just stuck with lesbian/trans porn. I'm speaking in past tense since lately I haven't watched any and haven't been horny (not on hormones yet but just lost interest). Now my sexual history: Like I said, never had sex with a woman. Did however experiment with a male friend during my teens. We met when I was 8 and he was 7 when we became neighbors and we became best friends. A couple years later probably around age 10 or 11 we'd occasionally show each other our genitals when playing in the woods and sometimes touch them together. Nothing out of the ordinary for kids and I also remember doing similar things with other friends when I was real young (~5). When puberty hit and we both started masturbating I started getting porn on my PC. I had my own PC in my room and he had a shared family PC so he couldn't get any so he'd come over and I'd show him some. He'd then go use my bathroom to masturbate. Shortly after one of us (probably me I'm guessing lol) suggested I help and give him oral while he watched, so I did. He'd say when he was ready to cum and I'd stop and he'd finish in a tissue. After that I then asked in return for what I did could I get on top? So I'd do that and then pull out when ready and finish in a tissue. At the time my family was religious as was I (in so much as I believed not that I actually really did religious things) and I thought being gay was wrong and I'd get HIV just from doing this. So I always felt super ashamed after, especially because I didn't feel gay since I wasn't attracted to him at all it was just sexual so I couldn't figure out why I couldn't stop. This continued for my entire teenage years until I turned 18. I stopped at 18 for two reasons. One he would've still been 17 so I was worried about age of consent stuff. And 2 was my shame issues. I convinced myself it was just dumb teen experimentation but if it continued as an adult it meant I was gay and that would be the worst thing ever I thought at the time :/ Now I'm atheist and open so I no longer regret what I did. In fact I do have regrets but only that it didn't go further. I never helped him to completion now I wish I had and he never tried to penetrate me and I wish I had let him try. Also I wish I had penetrated him but since I was overweight and below average I never actually penetrated when I'd go on top. That was my last and only experience with sex. So I'm not sure if me wanting to give oral and receive anal now is maybe just a nostalgia thing lol? Also any chance, even though what I did doesn't bother me anymore that somehow deep inside the religion/shame issues are clouding me so all I see is the sexual attraction but maybe I could eventually be physically/emotionally attracted to men as well as women? I'm wondering this because part of me wishes I was so my choices would expand greatly and now with the transitioning thing I'm sure I'll get more attention from men since even as male I'd get hit on by guys a lot but have to tell them I'm straight. Now I'd have to tell them I'm a lesbian but if I could tell them I'm bi and mean it it would open up a lot of things for me. I suppose things may become clearer when I get on HRT since I've read others who have similar feelings (attracted only to females or attracted to females but still sexually like it all) and once on HRT realized they liked both or even started preferring men. I realize my hormones won't change my sexual preference but it may help me realize what was already there but I was suppressing. Also I realize I have a fear of men which makes sense now but I always felt different than them and intimidated by them which now I realize is because I was trying (and failing miserably at lol) being one of them when I wasn't. Maybe once this fear goes away it'll allow me to be attracted to them completely. *Ok sorry see I rambled! lolSummary:
Summarize: So I really like this guy (F) in my economics class. We aren't great friends or anything, but we are friends, talk in class, etc. I've been deciding on whether to make a move or not for awhile. I'm really good friends with his half brother, who tried to find out if F was interested in me, but he's having trouble because he doesn't want to make it totally obvious. I haven't been in a relationship for like two years, and I've been dropping hints but I can't really tell if F is picking them up. He's a really nice guy in general. I've decided to just go for it and tell him how I feel. But I'm worried if he doesn't like me, our friendship will be awkward from now on. Like I said earlier, I think I'm just going to go for it and tell him I like him after class. I want other peoples opinions though, just in case I'm overlooking something.Summary:

Summarize: WARNING- long post So taking 400ug of LSD should be a nice trip, but I don't think it should have been as insane as it was for me. It starts at midnight, I take all four of my tested 100ug tabs of LSD in my friends car. We are driving to another friends house where there is about 7 people we all know tripping on 100-200ug. We arrive 20 minutes later and I am already full on tripping with strong visuals and everything is very dark. Nothing unusual yet, its the middle of the night so I guess everything would be dark. We all get in the car to go to another friends house where we heard there was a party. As soon as I get in the car I black out. Next thing I know i'm a 45 minute drive from where I live at two giant lakes in upstate New York. I get out of the car very freaked out, scared of everyone I see, then stumble back into the car where I black out again. When I come back around we are driving to my house because my friends said that I was freaking out and really wanted to go home. We get to my house, and I find myself freaking out in my driveway. I sprint for my house where I dive in and lock the door behind me. Everyone was banging on the door trying to get in and was blacked out, my friends said they heard my screaming like crazy inside the house throwing stuff around. It is about 2:30 am when I get inside my house. At this point in my trip I end my contact with any human. I climb up the flight of stairs in my house and crawl into bed. Upon getting into bed I lost all sense of reality. For hours I was in my bed crawling around, my body was contorting and twisting into crazy shapes and changing colors, my whole house was traveling at the speed of light through dimensions. I remember screaming like crazy because I was in so much pain feeling all of this. None of this probably actually ever happened, but my brain was convinced this was all real. Then BOOM it all stopped. I got up from bed, it was early morning, the clock read 7:21 and my vision was full of patterns across everything. I saw everything just covered in strips of acid; cool, colorful, intricate designs across every inch of my world. My body was small and completely different than it had ever been before. It was small and twisted, my limbs were black as burnt tar, and I was dented all over, my stomach went in, and my torso twisted in circles, my feet were balls, and my fingers were twisted and charred. My brain was convinced this was real, I thought I had traveled to a new realm where I had died. From the back of my head I could hear a song playing. I would think about being not really dead but in a simulation ran by a creator. I thought I was in a purgatory where spirits were deciding if I should die or be allowed to live in my own mind. They knew my twisted body wouldn't last long in a regular human world. While I as so deformed I felt as if I had super abilities and strength. I was moving across my room at super fast speeds able to move anything with no effort. The more I thought about these spirits judging me the louder music would play in my head. It went "If you can hear me make a sign, open the DOOR" as well as my mothers voice in my head saying "I swear to god he needs to get out of that room". I heard footsteps running trough the hallway outside my door and things scurrying through the walls. I was scarred to open my door though even though I could hear that music playing. I knew that if I could open it that would be the sign I needed to show that I could hear them and I could return to the human realm again. I wanted so badly to get back to my real body but couldn't bring myself to turn the door handle. Eventually the patterns cleared and the music stopped, I knew I had missed my opportunity. Upon making that realization I lost the physical ability I had and was stuck in this broken body super weak and fragile. I then open the door and make it downstairs. The scurrying started again the the walls and now I heard voiced screaming from the basement. The music began again in my head, and I ran around opening all the doors trying to find them and show the sign. None of the doors worked and the music in my head was so loud I couldn't hear anything else. I then had the great idea of lighting a fire in my kitchen below the fire alarms to show that I could hear them. Of course the fire alarm goes mad and the music instantly dies out. I thought I had done it, I was so happy I proved myself to these spirits that were in my house. I was still in the broken body so I began to make my way back to my room. When I reach the stairs I collapse in exhaustion and lose consciousness. Not sure when I wake back up, I find myself face down in a puddle of piss next to the ruins of the fire on my kitchen floor, with my walls spray painted all around me. My legs are so large and heavy that I cant move them or come even close to getting up. I lay like that at the bottom of my stairs for what feels like hours. My two cats and small dog approach me and sit in a line in front of me. I feel like my legs are getting more and more dense and heavy and I hear someone sprinting through the upper floor of my house. The fire alarm is still going off but now it is just making a single signal to announce that it is low on batteries. The red light would tick on, my legs would fill full of energy. The red light would stop and the sound would signal. Every time the sound went every door in my house would fly open, my dogs head would twist around, and a brown minivan would circle my house. I felt as if I was dying at the bottom of those stairs. My body was filling so full of this energy that it would cause me to explode into the universe forever floating around being punished for being so stupid as to take this acid that I was now convinced was nbom. I knew I would die and that the being in that mini van was a creator coming to show me my fate. I thought that the footsteps running through my house belonged to evil spirits that would take me to this place in the cosmos. My legs at this point were completely black and so full of this energy that they weighed many tons each. My Body was so twisted it was tar black and triangular. My heart was an engine pumping this energy so fast throughout my body. My legs begin to hover in the air in front of me as they begin to float into the sky. The one cat in front of me is talking to me, telling me that I am going to suffer incredibly for being so stupid as to throw away my whole life and the whole cosmic plan for me throughout all my past and future lives for some fake acid. That destroying that plan was so incredibly stupid I would be punished for an eternity travelling in this energy through the galaxy for forever. I felt as if the being in my house would release me from this mangled body to flow with the energy in my eternal torture. There was so much going on in my head, everything was speeding up for a climax that would send me out of this world. All of the sudden it all stops. My legs and rest of my body return to normal. The energy leaves my house, I no longer hear voiced or people running around. The cat stops talking and time begins to move again. It is 1 pm when this all stops, 13 hours after I originally took my dose of lsd. I repaint my walls and clean my floors, but the whole day whenever I thought of this crazy trip I would begin to hear the music in the back of my head again. At 8 pm when I still could hear the music, thought my fingers were still black and twisted, and was extremely paranoid I took an SSRI to calm myself down and end this strange trip. Basically I am now aware that these things couldn't have actually happened. I didn't really die from taking LSD and experience a purgatory before returning back to earth. My body wasn't really changed to that extreme and there weren't people running around my house screaming and talking to me. I am wondering if this 400ug of LSD brought out psychosis or schizophrenia or something like that in me. I am a 16 year old male and that was my 5th time taking LSD, my first time with that large of a dose and my first time experiencing anything as crazy as that. I broke my glasses, my bed, lit my house on fire, spray painted my walls, pissed on the floor, and punched a hole in a door. the lsd- my wall- what I was- the van-Summary:
Summarize: I appreciate your post but teaching people how to build/play storm in a pub in incredibly different from playing against the best players of DotA. In solo queue, you rely solely on yourself moreso than in pro matches. Skipping vortex can be good when you are relying on a team that you know will put out, can be effective, but in a game where you can't count on your teammates, it probably is the wrong direction to go to.Summary:

Summarize: I went on a cruise. I smuggled a handle on. got shit faced. went on a bar crawl , tried to steal beer from the bar. asked some 15 year old to dance, thank god she said no. shot one of those hocky puck things way to hard and the officer on duty came out to help me find it. I was too hung over to leave room for last two days of trip.Summary:
Summarize: I broke my leg in four places. (That's not the painful part.) It healed up in the wrong position so they had to re-break it to set it properly. After all that there were still bits of bone floating around loose in there so a couple years later I went in to have it surgically cleaned out. Everything went fine and they stitched me up all nice & neat, gave me a boot, & covered it all up in gauze and that long thick sock you get with the boot. They said after a few weeks I should come back in to have it checked out. Now I realized this should probably have been common sense, but they never told me I had to clean it & change the dressing a few times a day. So...I didn't. I was slightly alarmed that the pain hadn't gone down after a few weeks and it was hot to the touch but I'm an idiot & I have a pretty high pain tollerance so I was just ignoring it. The time went by and I went back in for my checkup. The doctor couldn't get the dressing off so she went in for a closer look and I've never seen a doctor look as horrified as she did right then...I had a raging skin infection and the gauze had actually started growing into the damaged skin. She looked really apologetic but she was like "look, I'm gonna do this as slowly as possible but I'm gonna have to get this off and it's gonna hurt..." She then basically proceeded to slowly rip the top layer of skin off half of my leg, while I was fully conscious. I didn't pass out but I almost did. I got really lightheaded & tasted metal in my mouth & I was shaking involuntarily. It wasn't fun. -50/10 would not do again. But hey it was my own stupid fault.Summary:
Summarize: Skating on Campus. Just starting to learn. I was going waaaay to fast downhill, and tried to lightly put my fut down to slow myself down, as I had seen several other skaters do this successfully. Well, it wasn't successful for me. Foot touches ground, board STOPS, and I fly forward in full flip mode. However, I was flying hard enough forwards, I actually pulled a full flip and landed on my feet. Que adrenaline rush. I feel like a BADASS. Look around.....NO ONE IS THERE. I angrily stomp off, retrieve my board and skate off like nothing happened.Summary:
Summarize: I was in an extremely similar situation to yours in my mid twenties. I moved back home for about 18 months, worked 2, sometimes 3 jobs until I had my debts either wiped out or at least under control, and finished school. It was one of the most difficult periods of my life- I was extremely depressed from the breakup (it was a really nasty one), everything about my life sucked, and I was working/doing schoolwork 24/7 but I kept plugging away until I came out on the other side. It wound up being the best thing I ever did. When I moved back out, I wound up living with my 2 best friends and had the time of my life. I had a lot more confidence in myself and much more success with the ladies as a result. I started dating my dream girl from high school, wound up marrying her a few years later, and my life now is so happy it's sometimes annoying.Summary:
Summarize: you're speaking my language. i was discussing with my room mate tonight that, despite the success of andy reid throughout his tenure with the eagles, it may be time for him to go. he asked me if i could really measure what we've done as 'success' under him or if it was mostly due to donovan and the rest of the great players we've had over the years and i honestly don't know any more. the breaking point for me is hearing fucking redskins fans compare this underwhelming, disappointing team to the shitshow they have going on right now. in all honesty, with better playcalling and coaching, we could easily have been a top tier team if not the most obvious contender for a superbowl this year. instead, we're this.Summary:
Summarize: It was kind of a bittersweet meet up honestly. Definitely not anything special or at all what we had discussed, but not exactly a disaster either. I'm not sure how to tell this story so I'm just going to start... My birthday is this month and he had been discussing what he wanted to do for/to me. How he wanted to just make the day all about my pleasure, sort of like the first time we slept together. He told me he got massage oil and and had been telling me he couldn't wait to get his hands on me, to tease me, and to taste me. That he wouldn't let me have his cock until I came for him. On his lips. That plan definitely went out the window. When I walked in he wrapped his arms around me and kissed me. My lips, my ears, my neck, and I was doing the same. Before I knew it he picked me up, my legs were wrapped around him, and he carried me to the desk. My dress was up around my hips and I could feel how hard he was through my thin tights. He pulled each of my legs up to his chest, running his hands the entire length, to remove my shoes as I laid back. I thought he was going to take me right there but we made it to the bed. We barely made it to the bed. He was pulling my tights off and on top of me in seconds. He left my panties on to tease me, letting me feel his hard cock against me. I reached down an pushed my panties aside and with one firm thrust I had all of him. That first moment always feels amazing. I feel so full, so tight around him. He fucked me like that, half of our clothes still on, moaning into my ear and neck, until he came. We relaxed still wrapped up in each other before finally stripping off the rest of our sweaty clothes and having a drink. We had somehow knocked the box of chocolates off the bed and wasted half of them. He laughed about how I ruined his plan and I told him there was still time. As we were talking and laughing and grazing what was left of the candy we we ended up discussing his wife and how jealous she is of one of their single neighbors and an invasion of his privacy that she did recently. I didn't know what to say and half hoped he wasn't making it up because of our communication talk recently (which we came to an agreement on anyway) and half hoped he was because it was a little crazy. Despite that awkward moment he soon had his hands on me again. I was the little spoon and he was caressing my body. Running his fingertips down my side, over my ass, gently kissing the back of my neck and nibbling my shoulder, until his fingers found their way between my thighs. He growled into my ear, mmm, as he does, "you're so wet for me" and I moved my ass against him so he could get inside me. I responded with a soft moan and told him I wanted him. He kept massaging my clit with his figers, his other hand across my chest holding me close, as he slowly but firmly pushed himself into me over and over, sending little waves of pleasure throughout my body. I could hear his breath quicken, even over my own noises, feel it against my neck. I was pushing back against him, my legs trembling, mumbling incoherent "yes"s between moans as he kept his pace. The perfect pace. As I started to cum he forced himself as deep as he could get and held his cock there, his fingers making just the right movements to take me over the edge, the arm over my chest held me tightly as I shook. After enjoying that for a few moments I rolled back against him, throwing a leg on each side, without losing his cock I was riding him backwards. This always makes me laugh a little because it reminds me of the "crab walk" game in elementary school. So, as I can't believe that is sexy, I sat up into reverse cowgirl. He loves looking at my ass and squeezing it and seeing me take him in. After what I believed was a good workout I hopped off and wrapped my mouth around him. I sucked all of my juices off of him. But I could only go so long wothout it and I started riding him again, leaning over to nibble his ears. The way he was grabbing me, the almost grunts I could hear, I knew he wanted it harder so I gave it to him, but before long he had me on my back again, with a pillow underneath me and my legs over his shoulders. He knows I love this, the slow deep thrusts and the way it makes his pelvis rub against my clit. It wasn't long befire my knees were buckling again and he started riding me hard, pushing my body towards the edge of the bed. By the time we finished my head and shoulders were hanging off. We didn't notice this but the clock in the room was an hour ahead so we didn't think we had much time afterward. We layed there relaxing and laughing and snuggling until he got into the shower. I watched him get dressed longingly and he came back to bed. It is always so hard for either of us to leave, and he started teasing me again. He was kissing my neck, which drives me crazy, and I alid his hand between my legs to show him exactly how crazy. Once he felt how badly I wanted him he started using thise fingers. Moaning and writhing he asked "can I make you cum like this?". I had to be honest. The answer was no. No one can, I barely can make it work myself. So he left me like that! All worked up wth no release. . . . . .Summary:
Summarize: I got my roommates R and M to come to a party with me on the other side of the dorm and we played a couple of drinking jenga and other slow burn drinking games. We chilled and we just drunk enough to have fun with it. V or (HB 8.5) according to my roommates was very social and flirty with only 1 drink to her name for the majority of the night. She apparently had a boyfriend but she made at least one comment about how they were fighting because of shitty shit he had done. I was at like a 2 from vaping weed when we all headed over and we all had a few beers. After a few hours of drinking games some of the other guys headed home and there was RA drama when some of the guys got caught outside with alcohol. Once everything settled down I sat next to HB on the couch started up casual kino again. We eventually were alone on the couch and I took the oppurtunity to make a reference to when we joked about being dared to kiss eachother earlier. She reacted well, gave eye contact so I kissed her for about 5 seconds, then nibbled her bottom lip and seperated. I then made a quick comment about how I was glad we had some alone time so we could connect without causing her drama. She said she didnt really mind etc and we continued to sit on the couch and talk until the other girls started to goto bed and I had to exit. She # closed me and sent me a goodnight text. My roommates thought she was awesome but lamented the fact she had a boyfriend and it crippled there game. I kept it casual till the moment was right and just forced my mind past the possible failure and awkwardness with the help of a bit of alcohol. Just keep up background kino esclation and eventually the situation will give you some alone time to capitlize.Summary:
Summarize: I have been with this girl for almost 4 months, and I have stronger feelings for her than I ever have for anyone else. We were friends for a while, and I was honestly an asshole to her. I would lead her on for a while before breaking it off suddenly and chasing some school whore, before repeating the cycle. But I finally decided to date her after asking her to prom, and it's been the best (almost) 4 months of my life. And so, I have huge regrets about the way I treated her before sometimes. And she tells me it's okay and that all that matters is where we are now, but I just cannot forgive myself. I've noticed more and more that when I am talking to her, I read way too much into things. I constantly question in my head whether or not she is mad at me, and I apologize for nearly everything if I get even the slightest hint that she may be mad. But the thing is, she's never once been angry with me. Sometimes I might say some things that will frustrate her a little and she will tell me, and my first thought is to begin apologizing. It's like I lose all sense of dignity, and just do my best to keep her from being angry with me. I can't stand myself when I do this, and I don't know why I can't help it. It's like when I talk to her, I watch what I say to prevent her from being mad at me (she doesn't notice that I do this) rather than just speaking freely and honestly like one should in a healthy relationship. Also, if it's significant: I've had several relationships/attempts at relationships before this one, and they have all ended in an awful way. It would take me another post entirely to explain even one of them. But the moral is that in all of my past relationships, whoever my girlfriend was would get mad at me, and for 99% of the time I wouldn't know why. I would always thing I did something wrong, and apologize for nothing in particular (just with the intention of making it up to them somehow), even though they would stay just as angry at me. This would always make me feel awful, especially about myself. Looking back on it now, I feel like that was its own type of abuse. I feel like this is a question I shouldn't even have to be asking. Can anyone relate to this? Any advice would be greatly appreciated as well.Summary:
Summarize: My girlfriend left facebook logged in on my computer. We recently broke up and got back together, with the single period lasting for 2 weeks. I thought it would be funny to send her a message to herself reminding her to log out next time, when I saw that she recently messaged her ex. He has been constantly bothering her, so I wanted to know if he said something that was threatening to her. I accidentally went too far back, and I saw several pictures of them fucking and walls of erotic text, and recently she talked to him about "breaking up with the poor kid." They then talked about his dick, and the conversation dropped. We got back together 3 days after this conversation, when she told me she didn't even think about getting with other guys. I threw up and I can't stop obsessing over it. What the hell do I do?Summary:
Summarize: When I lived in the UK when I was 20-21 I used to write referrals to ObGyns for half the chicks I fucked. Oh the horrors. I was prepared for the dental hygeine issues but not that...Summary:
Summarize: On Thursday, I was accepted into college so I decided to have a party like anyone would. I got a few friends over and so the mayhem began. Smashed a bottle of Jack in the space of an hour, topped off a Bacardi and coke, 80/20 and dropped about halfway through whatever I drank next. Needless to say, I was out until 12:00pm the next day. I waddled over to the kitchen to get some dry biscuits in an attempt to stop myself from emitting viscus death all over the house and just as I did a perfect 120 pivot to face the fridge only to see the hand-drawn notice tacked to it with a magnet that was once a squirrel but now only his body and one arm. "Hairdressers at 1:30 FRIDAY" I could have collapsed, I could have convulsed, I could have done both and left myself strewn on the cold floor for my roommate to discover my frozen corpse but no. I couldn't help but feel that not attending this appointment would be a grave mistake, after all, college means new people and this hair was three months behind a Vietnam vet, 3 months in a spider-hole so, it must be done. A challenge that I have accepted, as god as my witness, I will get this hair cut. And so, with a quick freshen up and some new clothes, I speed off out the door. 12:50. Drive into afternoon traffic, barely holding sick down. 1:12. Pull up on the parking lot, a block away from the hair dressers. 1:27. Hoist myself through the doors, finally here. Vomit at the ready. 1:32 and so, the empty hairdressers greeted me, this would be an in and out job, nothing more, nothing less. Quick and clean. The woman at the reception desk comes up to lead me to a chair after a few minutes of waiting and just as I open my mouth to say 'Thanks'. A storm of regret, Jack, Bacardi, Coke and dry biscuits topples out like Niagara falls, sliding down her dress, the majority of it on the floor and her shoes and then I slump back into a stationary position only for her to do some sort of Patrick Stewart quadruple take. I'm freaking out, she's freaking out, the other hairdresser is in a limbo of anger and laughter and I just lift my hands up in defense and walk at a fairly brisk pace backwards while saying sorry all the while. Still haven't got my hair cut.Summary:
Summarize: Is it really "being worked" when I simply don't think they have their shit together? Making it seem like the occasional great moment (and they are much more occasional than in years past) happens by accident makes them seem like they're halfassing it. Given what has come out about the creative structure (low pay, very long hours, nonunion shop, Vince having final say on storylines and changing long-term plans on a whim), it seems way more likely that a certain measure of chaos is present.Summary:
Summarize: Well, I'm so jealous. Maybe that's why. I just want two things from her. Apart from these, I accept everything that she can do. But she don't want. She always having fun with my decisions. She always like "Are we at stone age or something?" The only two thing that I want? Like I said before, I'm so jealous. So much. And maybe just because the country and city that we living. There are a lot of stupid "horny" people. A lot of. You can't even imagine. None of them can hold their eyes of my girlfriend's legs. I am not joking. I am not against her wearing but these situtations causes me to. That's so bad. You know, we can't get along with her. Also, she has a lot of friends and she keeps speaking with boys that I said "Never talk with him." For example, she keep giving "Hello" to a boy that he used fault language to my girlfriend and to me before.(Words like "WHORE" :(. I can't do something to him.) Think how I feel pathetic and crushed. I said the boy "Never talk with her anymore." and she keeps salutes the boy. Not only him. There are a lot of boy friends of her. Her boyfriends are more than her girlfriends. And she is like "I'm 18 and what do you think? Don't rule me like your family." My family is so tied to their religion. But not I am. But she keep saying that. I don't know. I don't even talk with an another girl. Not even only one girl. But she keeps talking with boys. I don't care about girls. Why she needs boyfriends? And our only problems are these. Seriously there is nothing else. She always having fun with my decisions. She always having fun with me. Even she love me, I feel like she is not. But I know/I hope she love me. I am not a guy that looking for relationship constant. But this one became my best relationship ever I had. By the way this is my first relationship. But please don't tell me something like "You are so young, you have a long patch on your life." Please. Actually I am so crushed. Sometimes I go to the toilet at my school and starts to crying. I got family problems. My family's money situtation is going so bad. My father and mum always fighting these days. She is my only support, but look what she doing to me. I said, "Okay forget about the wearing short things, you can. But atleast don't talk with boys. Don't salute them. I love you so much, I can't stand." But she rejects me. What should I do? Please help me.Summary:
Summarize: I got these as a gift on Christmas 2012. They've been used gently almost every day and are cracking right under the silver disks on both sides 6 months later. I've contacted Playstation about it who told me to pound sand, as they don't cover physical damage. The person who handled my request after I noticed the second side was cracked too was actually pretty rude. Told me to go buy new ones as I'd obviously abused them. Needless to say, I'm pretty pissed. I've used Sony products for a lot of my life with no issue. Up until today, I've been singing the praises of these headphones. I plan on sending them in anyways with a list of URLs to sites of people complaining of this inherent design flaw and have even found a few pictures. I only found one reply of someone saying theirs was replaced. Has anyone had any problems with these? Any luck in getting them fixed?Summary:
Summarize: My DM pretty much screwed me over in my campaign. My character killed a goblin and decided to carry it's head around on a necklace. It slowed me down and caused me to take a penalty to Intimidate (I was hoping for a bonus), so I just cut the tongue off and wore that. Later, we fought and killed a demon. I cut off a piece of flesh to wear on my necklace and another player cut off one of it's horns. We then ended up in a fight with two drow. They disappeared and I was denied their tongues. After that, we fought some trolls. They crumbled into ashes so I couldn't have their tongues. Then the party was attacked by two devils. We killed them and I tried to take their tongues. My character was unaware of the fact that one devil was made of fire and the other was made of glass. The glass one's tongue was shattered when I tried to take it and the fire one burned me badly. Our paladin healed me, which was the one thing that saved me from the DM's next move. He asked me if I still had the goblin tongue and demon flesh. I said yes and he told me that I took 19 acid damage and 15 poison damage. Those brought me down to -2 hp. I also took a permanent -2 penalty to all defenses and a -5 penalty to all attacks. As a level 7 character, this makes my attacks pretty worthless as they won't be able to hit anything unless I roll pretty high. Then the DM told the player who took the horn that he can use it as a weapon that does 2d10 damage.Summary:
Summarize: This might be a lengthier post. We started dating 9 months ago, and after four months we decided to commit to one another. At the beginning, our relationship was beautiful, and fully immersed in the honeymoon stage. It's worth saying that I've had anxiety issues my entire life (rough childhood, etc). In December, they kind of "hit" me again because of a big career/school decision I made. I opened up to my boyfriend, and he saw some of my anxiety attacks. Although, I am unmedicated and have done very well for many years, I definitely needed to seek a counselor (which I did). I thought our relationship was fine, and even gave him an out when things were tough for me, promising that I would understand. He decided to stay. Now, we have both had an incredibly stressful semester. I am a full-time student and work nearly full-time as well. He is in law school. We live 45 mins-1 hr away from one another, just to give some perspective of what we are up against. Anyway, a few months after we exchanged "I love you's," some things started getting a little rough in our relationship. Our mutual friend (who we met through) and my boyfriend talked about my sexual history, and that sparked some issues. She came to visit for her spring break (they met in his former law school), and I got upset because I didn't trust they wouldn't talk poorly of me. I realize this was my own issue, but I confronted both of them about it. They ended up blacking out together at his apartment alone, and then she slept there. I explained to him that having a woman sleep over is a deal-breaker issue for me (I realize that some people don't feel this way, but I feel very strongly about that). This was the point when we started fighting, almost every day..... He decided he could no longer say "I love you," he ignored me when we were trying to make plans for the following day because he was busy partying with his good girl friend (also his high school ex, which he failed to tell me), he went to a fundraiser (dates welcomed) and didn't tell me about it, and he has lacked in introducing me to his friends/family for the most part. I started freaking out and not trusting him, especially since he took back the fact that he said he loved me. It's led me to fight and argue constantly. Long story short, after countless arguments over this past month, he admitted that he hasn't been a good boyfriend, but he truly cares about me, and wants to make things right. He told me the reason he has been acting this way is because my anxiety made him need to pull back emotionally from me. It's very frustrating to me because treating me poorly and not communicating that with me was a poor decision on his behalf. Now, the issue is that he is now going into finals. They end in one month, but he wants to be left completely alone, aside from texting/calls. Our relationship is in such a fragile state, that I have been getting upset over everything. I told him I can't keep things in, even though I know he needs to study and our fights are more dramatized because of the stress. I don't understand why he can't study with me (when I am willing to drive and be silent as we study). I am just altogether really frustrated and told him to call me at 10:30pm every night, in an attempt to avoid fighting with him while he studies. I know he can be a good boyfriend, and I do know that he cares, but there are just so many questions going through my head about whether he is as invested in this relationship as I am. I'm at a pretty big loss as to what I should do right now... Any advice appreciated.Summary:
Summarize: So my relationship with my bf was perfect in the beginning, but toward the end of the semester of my undergraduate year, he became paranoid (checking trash, putting a keylogger on my laptop, etc). It was extremely stressful for me and I was so sad that he could not trust me. I was also dealing with finals. This is when I began to hurt myself. We decided to move in together that summer. We thought things were fine between us. Shortly after we moved in and started pharmacy school, we began to have fights. I was upset that he was not helping out around the house with cleaning and I was stressed about school. Eventually, our apt just got dirtier and dirtier as I lost motivation to clean. We fought a lot. Sometimes over little things like him dropping a banana peel and refusing to pick it up. I would hurt myself by cutting or stabbing. Maybe it was for attention. Maybe I was trying to get rid of the pain I felt during our fights. Maybe I wanted him to see physically how much pain was going through my head. I don't know. Eventually I began to drink. When we fought and I was upset, I drank. Not beer... vodka, rum, etc. I knew it was a bad habit, but I felt like it distanced the pain I felt. One day, it was new years at my temple. I was very excited to go with him and he had agreed he would go. At the last minute he decides he doesn't want to go. I was extremely upset. This day was one of the days I was looking forward to all year. I was so upset, I drank too much and had to go to the ER. I'm not proud of this. After that day, it's become worse. I did go to counseling, but it wasn't helping much, so I stopped going. We continued to fight. I continued to cut. I think the cutting slowed down, but I kept drinking. One day, the night after Christmas (Dec. 26), I got so upset that I drank half a bottle of cough syrup. I intended to kill myself, but I was scared. I called the poison center and they told me to go to the ER. They said to call and ambulance or have someone drive me. I wasn't going to cause a scene and call the ambulance. I asked my bf if he would drive me. He said no. So I drove myself. Luckily I didn't become too drowsy before I reached the ER. They took care of me. My bf called my family and told them what happened. I refused to see them because I didn't want them to see me this way. After that incident, I felt determined to get help. I was going to lose him and the life and home we built together if I didn't get better. So I went to counseling again. I told them everything. I told them how I hurt myself and I wanted to get better. They referred me to other counselors and I had to keep telling the same story over and over again. I finally was able to get to a psychiatrist, but I was scared to take medicine. I wanted to see if I could get better on my own with just therapy. One day, my bf and I had a fight. I decided then that I NEED medicine to help get me through my depression and help me stop overreacting to things. I was prescribed lexapro. It helped. A lot. I am up to 10mg right now, but with what's happened, I feel like I need the 20mg. I also began to take bupropion for motivation. I wasn't doing well in school. I stopped caring about school and got bad grades. But I was getting better. There were less fights. Things were happier with us. Recently, I got into a fight with my bf after we went to a chinese restaurant. It was stupid. He was drunk and being extremely annoying and I was not in the mood. I told him and let him know I was not in the mood, but he wasn't listening. When we got home. I tried to lock myself in the car so I could cool down and not get upset. But he didn't want to leave me as it was dark and he felt he should walk me back. Eventually I walked back with him, and when I got to the door, I said I was going to leave for a bit and he said fine, don't come back. I got very upset at that and hit him with my purse and went inside the apt. He broke up with me. We sat in separate rooms. He started chatting to some old friends that were girls. Apparently, they had liked him back then and he had liked him too. This got him thinking that he wanted to have sex with other girls. He regretted not living his single life confident and being able to date around. He had only been with me and his ex. He wanted to experience more. YOLO he said. I was hurt. I felt like I wasn't good enough. It hurt me deeply, but at least he was honest. Usually when he says we're through, things are normal the next day. And they were. Until I got drunk one saturday morning. I confessed to him I read his messages -- a crime I am guilty of often. The reason I read them was because I met a girl he had messed with in the past. I asked him if he talked to her about me meeting her and he said no. It was obvious he was lying. I looked at his emails and yes, he did talk to her. He did lie. When I confessed that I read his emails, I also said that I understood why he talked to her and it was okay. I just wished he hadn't lied to me. He got upset. We had a fight. I left to my mom's and then eventually came back and drank more. Since then, I've been asking him if we are together or not. He wanted to tell me a week later, but I didn't like leaving it up in the air. It was making me anxious. It was stressing me out. Eventually he said we could be together on three conditions. 1. I have to work out for an hour three times a week (I guess I'm too fat for him? Even though he gained like 60lbs since I met him and I've gained maybe 20lbs?) 2. I can't invade is privacy by reading his messages (that's fine. I shouldn't be doing things like that anyway.) 3. He can have sex outside the relationship once a year and I could do the same. I was NOT agreeing to 3. No way. I am not like that at all. I went to therapy. She said, do I really want to live like this for the rest of my life? No, of course not. I blame myself for our relationship falling apart. I was depressed and that really hurt our relationship. It was all my fault. She said, if he really loved me he would be more understanding about my condition. I went home and messaged my bf (he works second shift). I said I think I should leave. I can't be with someone who doesn't feel the same way about me as I feel about them. If he loved me, I should be enough. I packed half my stuff and my dog and went to my mom's. I stopped outside my mom's and asked him if he wanted another chance. He said yes. He can be committed. He was thinking in the past and his future was with me. So I went back. I'm weak. Today, things started out fine. Then I got to thinking.... what does he mean when he says he'll never cheat on me. So I asked him, what does cheating mean to him. I just wanted to be on the same page as him, but he got so offended. He was saying that I was starting drama and that we're through. I was just being assertive. I wanted to trust him and know that we're on the same page in our relationship. He said he had enough and to get out and be gone by the time he got home. I went to therapy and talked to my therapist about everything. And she agrees, I didn't do anything wrong. He eventually told me right before therapy what his definition of cheating is, but now he says we're not together. I don't know what to do anymore. I am so tired.Summary:
Summarize: I'm I the only one who doesn't like this guy? Okay today's copyright schemes are bullshit designed by greedy assholes, but this guy isn't some brave hero or selfless fighter like they are over at the pirates bay. This guy made money off copyrighted material. You cannot complain about copyrights while making money off them to! So let's stop pretending like this guy is just another innocent victim. He made money off other people's backs.Summary:
Summarize: My general feelings toward the stream are that it was really funny to watch in general and looked like fun, but a lot of the jokes Rockstar were trying to make really fell flat from the perspective of the AH stream. Also, it seemed like the devs were ignorant of who they were actually talking to and what they do which seemed to annoy the guys a little. Ray, Michael and Geoff seemed to make more than a few snippy comments in response to this, while Ryan, Lindsay and Jack just kinda went quiet. My biggest issue was the huge discrepancy between when AH was live with the devs and when they were separate. The commentary was generally way better when the devs weren't talking with the AH which really defeats the purpose of the stream. I do like how well Jack tried to maintain the peace, though clearly there were too many personalities in the room for anyone to really take full control. Lastly, it was pretty stupid how Rockstar devs couldn't get all of AH into the games and didn't seem to really have much control at all over the lobbies. That makes no sense whatsoever and left people from AH sitting there twiddling their thumbs.Summary:
Summarize: This is by far the weirdest I've ever had AND heard of... I walk into my backyard from my house and circuit a roundabout created by our above-ground pool to get to the shed. My (now ex) girlfriend's dog is sitting in a shallow tray and rotating at an alarming speed. It barks a few times and I continue walking the circuit. I see my ex, completely naked except that her naughty bits are covered by a thick layer of straggly black fur. She's sitting in a pool of mud and dragging her ass across it like a dog with her legs in the air. I get mad at her and tell her to get dressed, to which she replies 'He's only making me get dressed because (blank) is here'. She disappears and I mount the stairs to the pool. Now, I don't know if anyone remembers this, but there was this weird girl on youtube a few years back, her videos were just her, staring at the camera and doing nothing. I only ever watched like, 1 joke reaction video to her. Apparently it stuck with me though. That girl shows up and is dressed in a geisha costume, face paint and all. As a testament to how completely random this dream was, this is her only appearance. All of the sudden there are lots of people there and they are chanting for a mutual friend of me and the ex's to do 'the reactor thing'. He jumps in the pool with a ball and starts spinning in the center of it, not moving the water or anything, but just kind of chilling. Next thing I know there are bubble versions of random shapes scribing an orbit around this guy, some of them operated by other random people and some of them just free-floating. A bubble chair hits me in the back of the head and when I look up again, everything is gone except there is an entire marching band in the pool. They all start walking toward the audience and play a final tune. Some of them go down on one knee, presumably to asphyxiate underwater. An announcer says 'And that was the brentwood marching band. How about a round of applause!' And I'm the only one clapping.Summary:
Summarize: Less than 8 hours, can't remember exactly what time I met him. We were already students in the same class but I'm shy and mostly keep to myself. There was a round of introductions going around because we volunteered to move around some equipment (this is in a community college building that shares a graphic design studio and a video production studio, complete with all of the necessary equipment to conduct a mock newscast). What started as a little light-hearted teasing about my awkwardness turned into a few raunchier jokes (something about Pornhub). By this time it was around 5 PM, which is considered really late since half of the other students usually leave by lunch, and the rest filter out by about 3; I was staying late to do work on a project. We left because the guy in charge of the building left. We chatted outside for a while, and then somehow it turned into an invitation for sexual congress. I wasn't even attracted to him but since I was a kissless virgin And I wasn't dense, I said yes. I led him to a bathroom that I knew was out of the way so there would be less traffic. I was so hopped up on nerves and adrenaline that I couldn't cum, but getting a blowjob felt great. He also fucked my ass, but his trouser snake was more akin to a fucking boa constrictor (one guess as to what ethnicity); I couldn't take more than 4 or 5 inches before it hurt. He finished on my ass, we cleaned up, and parted ways.Summary:
Summarize: This is about the most complex situation I've found myself in. I met a girl online in October of last year. It started out as us helping get each other off, but progressed into us actually getting to know each other. The more we talked the harder we both fell. About 4 months after meeting her online I flew from Michigan to the UK where she lives to meet up with her for about 10 days. While we were there, we acted like a couple but once I left things kind of hit the fan for a bit. She was mad that I was excited to leave (I'm very close to my friends and family and missed them). She also was confused and frustrated that I didn't want to say we were together. She wrote me an e-mail saying she couldn't do it any more and we stopped talking for two months. I was devastated. If I'm being 100% honest, the situation scared the shit out of me and I wanted to give her an early out so that I wouldn't get hurt. In my mind I felt that the situation worked out fairly well for me but didn't work for her. I'm a PhD student, I knew that I would be moving 3 to 4 times in the next 3 to 4 years for jobs. The odds of me starting a lasting relationship during that time in my mind were low. But for her, I felt like her being interested in me meant she would be passing up on opportunities. Eventually we started talking again but without the over sexuality. Occasionally things would slip out about desire for one another. I'd always not attend to it. I wanted to be her friend and wanted to be there for her. We did both understand that the feelings were mutual. I think if one of us had the courage to say "I love you" the other would be willing to return it. Over the past 5 months or so our relationship has been building up again. It's more or less everything except the sex. The problem is due to my work schedule, her work schedule and time differences we only get to talk 1 hour a night on weeknights typically and sometimes one of us is busy for that. Anyways, the other night she went on a date. I was encouraging and told her I'd be jealous but I'm happy for her (this happens whenever one of us goes on a date). This felt different though, things had been different between us lately and I found this one hurt. I tend to be someone who's more pragmatic than emotional but this dysregulated me to the point of being nausea. We talked afterwards and we spoke about the impact it had on me. The pragmatic issues of distance, and that ultimately we both want to be in a local relationship. However last night as I was thinking I realized a few things. I only look for dates after I hear of her getting someones number or thinking about it and I don't want to be in a local relationship, I want to be in a local relationship with her. I also realize that I care about this woman so much that I just want her to be happy and that I'm starting to worry that my trying to meet her needs might be leading her to speak up about if she would want to just try to figure out things with me in some way shape or form. I have a lot going on in life right now and it's making it rather hard to be level headed about this. I could really use some insight, suggestions, advice, or support.Summary:
Summarize: Some background: I dated a guy for a few years (first serious relationship, etc etc), who turned out to be really emotionally abusive and manipulative. He hid EVERYTHING from me, and it really damaged my sense ability to trust people. Additionally, he made incredibly disparaging comments about my appearance, weight, career choice, etc, further fucking over my sense of self worth and self esteem. After we broke up, I realized that a lot of what he did was really fucked up, and worked through most of the issues with therapy and the help of great friends. For the most part, I thought I was fine. Now, a few years later, I'm dating an absolutely wonderful guy. He and I click on so many levels, and it's really a fantastic relationship. It's my first real relationship since breaking up with my ex, and I realized that there are still some emotional scars that are left. Even though my current boyfriend is very open and honest, I still feel like I can't trust him. It's not about infidelity (despite being cheated on in the past, I have no worries about him doing the same). Its about other things, like I feel I can't trust him when he says he wants to hang out with me, that he's missed me, or that he finds me attractive, etc. I assume that he's lying about it, for whatever the reason. He always shows and says that he's glad to be dating me, but I always find myself questioning his motives. (I haven't said anything to him about it, thank goodness) I was just wondering if any fellow Redditors have experienced this, and how they've handled it? I feel silly putting it into words, because logically if he's dating me, he would want to see me (and he's said or done nothing to show me otherwise), but I can't seem to get over that mental block, and I don't want to push him away with my own insecurities.Summary:
Summarize: Let's start off by saying I don't have the best self-esteem. Most of the time, I'm fine, but my anxiety disorder coupled with ADD can get the best of me. My boyfriend and I have a great relationship, but whenever I get stressed out while cramming for a test, I procrastinate in a very self-destructive way -- I go through pictures of him and his ex. For some background, my boyfriend was with his ex [25F] for a year and a half (broke up about two years ago), during which they lived together and traveled the country together in his car. She's semi-internet-famous for "suggestive but innocent" photos she takes of herself, which was what they were focused on during their road trips. These pictures are everywhere - flickr, tumblr, facebook, and whenever I see them, I'm reminded that my boyfriend used to be with someone so much more beautiful than myself. Someone that the internet loves to drool over. Unfortunately, it's not just pictures of her. When they traveled together, they took lots of artistic "in love" pictures that look like they were meant to be together -- spontaneous kisses, hugs, laughter, waking up in a hotel room together, looking like they're about to have sex on a stove, etc. with comments from him like "this will always be my all time favorite photo in the world. ever <3" or about how the place pictured was where he first told her he loved her (which hurts, because though I know my feelings, he hasn't come to tell me that yet). Of course, when I would talk to him about how the pictures made me feel, he would tell me that the photos didn't show everything going on in the relationship. He said even though their travels felt like a movie, she was selfish, a cheater, etc. The problem is that even with him telling me these bad things about her (which I feel so petty for feeling good about) and their relationship, I still feel so distraught when going through these pictures. I know it's in the past and I shouldn't be comparing our relationships, but I have no self control! I'm not always going through their photos -- it's only when I feel stressed out that I go into this terribly destructive mode. I feel bad because I'm a full time student with a job, so I have no time for road trips like these. Even if I had the time, my dad said he would stop supporting my education if I chose to go on a trip like that with my boyfriend. I feel bad because I'll never be able to go on adventures with him, I'm not as pretty as her, and I will never be as photogenic in pictures with my boyfriend than her in the ones forever framed and fawned upon by the internet. Help me. I know I'm a complete CRAZY IDIOT for doing this and I've tried stopping, but I can't control myself. I've talked to my boyfriend about it maybe twice, but I don't want to bring it up again as a repeat issue.Summary:
Summarize: One more cop story about my uncle who is a cop in Littleton (he has so many good ones). This wasn't actually an arrest since the guy was dead. Anyways, they get a call about a weird smell coming from a guys apartment, like decomposing flesh. So they get in there and find this guy butt naked dead in his bedroom. He is laying on his back with a giant dildo coming out the side. So they place bets on whether it is in our out when they flip him over. It was in, come to find it, there was another foot long dildo up there. So this guy rammed a foot long dildo up his colon, and another one about half way up and then died basically. They also found an ironing board upside down, picture the X shape the legs make. On one side of the X leg was a dildo attached, so this guy would ride the iron so the one leg would shove the dildo up his ass. One more fun fact, they found zero porn in this guys place, just a picture of a deer tapped to the wall by the ironing board.Summary:

Summarize: For what it's worth: I lost 70lbs over 6 months doing keto. I didn't track a damn thing, was lax on the weekends (beer), and straight up spat in the diet's face by occasionally eating ice cream or other indulgences. I had been fat all my life, and even though I was restricting the types of foods I ate it wasn't nearly as stressful as your method sounds. Eat meat, dairy, vegetables, tree nuts, and (some) fruits. Avoid bread, rice, sugary things, etc. Piss on some ketostix until you're in keto, carry on, then check again every once in a while. Power through the plateaus. You'll be fine.Summary:
Summarize: This will probably get buried at this point but whatever. here you go but I think I was most influenced in my teen years by bands like Venom, Bathory and Burzum. I didnt get along with anyone else in school and was just like "fuck it" and I think I started dressing that way to annoy everyone as much as possible because they were all a bag of small town dicks. THEN as you get a bit older and you see all of the 40 year old women trying to desperately cling to their gothic youth with their piercings that are now sagging and their stupid pyramid stud belts you wake up and think "I dont want to be that creepy old bitch hanging out with teenage goth kids" and you get your shit together. I took the metal out of my face and the ring in my septum big enough to fit a golf tee through, bleached my hair to white and enrolled in university. You just GROW OUT of it. If you dont grow out of it theres something wrong with you. unless youre a big black metal fan in which case fuck it, you can pull that shit off forever. Still love black metal, but now I enrich my life and step out there with glorious tunes by bands like passenger of shit and in a few more years Ill be rocking a PHD.Summary:
Summarize: I'll try to keep this short because I'm so beside myself. And, just, incoming. Pity party/woe is me/angst/nobody loves me/horrible person with horrible thoughts bullshit incoming... I've been dating my boyfriend (27/M) for close to two years. We've been living together since June of last year due to individual circumstances that lead up to that decision. No one needs to tell me that was a bad idea, as I'm reaping the repercussions. Not even a year after we started dating, because of being overworked and just plain lazy, my boyfriend ignored me for an entire six months and masturbated in secret. Leaving me to wonder why he wouldn't come to bed, why our sex life tanked, why nothing I was doing was turning him on or getting him interested in me. Sex, to me, is important, I love to bond, I love to make my partner feel good, and I would hope they would do the same for me. My boyfriend is very much more of a quality time person, gets his intimacy from day to day pleasantries, eating dinner together, etc. He was getting his needs met during this six month period and, I guess, just never thought to give a shit about me. This whole situation has turned me into a fucking monster. I am sad and angry all the time. I've been very depressed because I just feel fat, ugly, stupid for ever believing him when he said he loved me, and just "less than". Until very recently, I had a serious addiction to alcohol, that sent me to the hospital once, unbeknownst to him. We're in therapy, he recognizes why he did was wrong, and why, he knows he's screwed this relationship up almost irreparably, and I'm trying to work with him and trying to learn to forgive. But, last night, I almost lost it on him. I noticed when we came home from therapy yesterday that his mood tanked. I asked him what was wrong, and he said that he wasn't sure if I'd be sticking around to fix this with him, and ever marry him, because that's what he ultimately wanted out of our relationship. He later admitted he just wanted me to tell him everything would okay. That is what I should have said, 100%. Instead, I dodged his feelings and went on a diatribe about how I didn't have a timeline on forgiving him, that I was seriously, deeply hurt still, and didn't think six months was ample time to get over it, considering I've just only recently decided to get a handle on my health in an attempt to improve my self-esteem. He immediately got upset and yelled at me, "This is why I never fucking talk to you!" And turned his back to me (we were in bed). I kind of tried to keep my cool, but ultimately had an anxiety attack, and started defending myself. I basically retold the story of how he wasted six months of my life, cheated me out of a satisfying sex life because of his own selfishness and laziness. He told me I was turning the conversation away from him, making it all about me. I agreed, telling him it's rather hard to sympathize with someone who willingly ignores his girlfriend's needs because "I was tired, and pleasing another human being is too hard". Yes, he actually said that to me. He tells me two wrongs don't make a right, basically, that I can't suck him dry, and ask for all of this physical attention and yet make no attempt to meet his needs. He says our dynamic right now is unhealthy. I agreed, but, pointedly explained that I was justified, and not just doing it because "it's too hard/It's too much work". You know, I'm not a lazy asshole (or wasn't). I busted my ass and gave him way more than he ever deserves, and he took me for granted, and hell yeah, I'm fucking pissed. We ended the conversation without a resolution, and went to bed. But, holy fuck. I just want to strangle him. When he says things like this, it comes off as, "I apologized, started doing everything you asked,"(that he should have been doing in the first fucking place, but, I digress) "WHY WON'T YOU FORGIVE ME AND GET OVER IT???" I'm so out of my mind, confused, over all of this. I'm pissed that he's making such a big deal about me still being angry about being outright ignored because considering your SO's needs are "too hard", and I don't want him to have the security he previously had, because I feel he just wants something to abuse, again. When he told me that he felt I didn't love him anymore, I had to pause and redirect the focus of the conversation because, I honestly don't know anymore. I got burned, bad. I don't want to go through any of this ever again. He says he just feels like he's paying a debt, and nothing will get better, because it's been six months and I've still barely loosened up about it. I can't help but agree, part of me wants him to suffer what I suffered. Fuck him, right? But, logically, and on an empathetic note, it's 100% wrong to be like this with him. So I'm very lost, reddit. What do I do now? I want to work through this. How do I start to see him with at least a semblance of what I once did? How do I learn to respect him, again? How can I let go of all of this anger? I've gotten so bad since we started seeing our therapist, that she suggested I go on antidepressants because of how much more miserable I look every week. Every other aspect of my life is tied to this relationship. My job, my friends, things I value, and love, and want to be around to cherish. I used to have my boyfriend on that list, but now, every time we're in a room together... I don't know. I'm so tense, I feel like a burden, I feel like he'd be better off married to his hand, or someone he actually fucking loves, and treats them the way he should have been treating me. I'm so lost...Summary:
Summarize: Hi all I'm about to head off for 1 year in SE Asia. Obviously given the time I'm going to be there I plan on going to multiple countries: Thailand, Bangladesh (volunteering for 4 months), Cambodia, Thailand, then Laos, Vietnam, Singapore, Malaysia, India (the last 5 are in any order, the previous countries are set around my work, then meeting family and a friend for short holidays). I can't arrange any but the Bangladesh visa before heading out (Thailand on arrival, the others are 6+ months ahead of time). I'm travelling on a UK passport. How is it getting a visa while on the road? Obviously I'll in in Bangkok twice or more, is this the best place to go to get any further visas for future travels? Also any unsolicited advice is always welcome, it's my first long, solo trip ... Hope that makes sense ...Summary:

Summarize: So since the first day I met my roommate, I knew my roommate and I would have many a heated debate, because he was in the ROTC and was as conservative-minded as one might expect to find in Oklahoma, and I'm a super liberal homosexual. He has said things in the past that made me think it was not the best idea to come out to him, but nothing too bad just the common articulation that he thinks gays shouldn't have the same rights to marriage as straight people. Recently he had to do ALLY training at our college, which is like a certification that you are not a homophobe and if you need to talk you're there to listen. he told me that at the end, he didn't want to be certified because he thought it would look like he "supported the homosexual lifestyle", so I had pretty much decided to just not tell him and then never see him again after this semester. Last night, we both got in about 4:30 in the morning and were laying in our bunk bed talking about all sorts of random shit, and then somehow we got onto the topic politics (as per usual) and then more specifically his position on homosexuality. I don't know what made me think that this was a great time particularly for me to tell him, but I think it was because i sensed he didn't mean gay people any harm, like some do around here, he was just raised in rural USA with strong Mormon beliefs. I said something along the lines of "I know this might sound a little crazy but I'm gay, man" to which he replied, "I'm fine with that, i don't really care".Summary:
Summarize: Come from a pretty racist home, my father always pushed his views on my older brother and I. My older brother always stayed out of it but I guess I was just more easily influenced. My sophomore year of high school I started experimenting with drugs. Weed kind of gave me a more mellow outlook on life but the one incident that really changed my racist views was when I did acid for the first time. There I was, frying my brain out sitting at a coffee table that had a bowl of decorative marbles, all of varying colors and designs. I started taking them out of the bowl and sorting them, then it clicked, they might all be different colors or designs but at the end of the day they are all marbles. Made me instantly recognize my ignorance and change my view. I know it might sound totally ridiculous but I am very glad I had that experience.Summary:
Summarize: As someone who has over a thousand hours in League of Legends and has started playing Paragon a lot more because of the reason that league is kinda boring by now it is incredibly annoying to see people who don't have map/chat awareness. When I'm trying to ping something or when I'm asking for information in the chat a lot of players don't even notice (or care) it and often die unnecessarily. Or you die because they didn't answer the question "Did your lane opponent back, is he roaming or is he miss without us knowing where he went?".

Summarize: Not that easy to find jobs here. The primary industry is RMG. If that stops there will be no alternative for the non-landowners in the rural communities. The RMG industry has done more good than bad here. Most of the workers there are unskilled women. What jobs do you think are there in the "rural communities". None. I'v been there. Absolutely none. Refraining from buying their products is not he answer. What we need to do is to create pressure to enforce health and safety codes. The largest manufacturers are always up to code because the buyers regularly inspect the factories, but the small sub contractors ignore them for a quick profit. The easiest solution is to create a clause in the contract with the major manufacturers which will ban employing sub-contractors, at least un-inspected sub contractors.Summary:
Summarize: Ok, so here's my story thus far. In February I received two tolls bills from crossing 520 bridge in the mail saying that I owed them, plus a minimal extra fee that had been added on since it didn't come out of my Good To Go account like usual. Upon calling to clarify why I had received them, I was told that it looked like I had many more tolls that were unpaid. The woman then told me that she would look in to it and call me back with more information. An hour later she called me back and told me that it looked like I had a couple hundred dollars in tolls and civil penalties that were unpaid. I asked her why I would have all of those when I have an account with them where the toll is supposed to be taken out every time I go across 520 automatically. She told me that they occurred when my account was in the negative, but that she could see on my account that every time it had been negative I had added money shortly after to make up for it. Every time this happened, I had been told that the amount I added would cover any tolls that I had incurred while the account was in the red. Evidently not. When I asked her why I had never received a toll bill before then I was told that it looked like they had been sent to my house (the same address that is on my account and that my car is registered to) but it had been sent back to them, so they sent it to my old address . When asked why it would have been sent back to them she told me to "take it up with your mailman". I requested copies of all the tolls so I could go over them individually. A month and a half later I received 5 large packets filled with papers. All in all the tolls added up to over $5500! 129 tolls adding up to $516 and just as many civil penalties at $40 each, adding up to $5040. I do what the only option is and call and made a court date to dispute it. Between the time I received the packet and my actual court date, I discovered that the pass I had on my car was defective and they had been over charging me 25 cents every time I went over the bridge for over a year; yet another thing they could have told me any time I had called to add money to my account, but chose not to inform me of. So my court date comes (4 days ago). I get to court, and the judge is awful. Not only to me, but to nearly every other person there. She drops about 10 of the tolls I had on my account. YAY, $400 off of $5500 doesn't really do shit for me. She tells me that the address on my account is correct, so I must have received all of them and just chose to ignore them. About 2 days later I open my mail to find that I have an official judgement paper saying I now owe $5,146 and that it's due in full by June 13th. So after having a full on mental break down, I call to appeal the judgement, and in typical fashion, the person I talk with is horrible and completely unhelpful. She basically tells me that I have to do everything my self and that I should go to the public law library. That's it. Nothing on the procedure for filing the paper work, or who I can talk to about it, or where to even get the paper work. (Mind you, this is the phone number WSDOT gave me to speak to about appealing) I decide to call Good To Go customer service to see if I can get call records showing that I was told that the mail was returned and sent to my old address. When I speak with the woman on the phone she tells me I should have been sent an evidence packet with all that in it 3 days before my hearing. Something I was never told of and never received. I ask her if I can get copies of it still and she tells me I can, but I need to go in to one of their customer service centers to get it. So today I head in to the center to pick it all up and am told that I have to have a subpoena to get it now that it's past my original hearing. I leave with nothing other than more intense frustration. I make my way down to the court house, and endure the piss covered disgust that is the two block radius around it. When I get to the law library the woman there tells me they don't have the papers there, but she gives me some pamphlets on free legal services in Seattle. (None of which are available until Tuesday, two days before the amount is due). She also kind of laughs and gives me a knowing smile when I tell her the woman told me to go there and that she was incredibly unhelpful. She wishes me the best of luck and I go on my way. So, here I am. Potentially about to be screwed out of $5100 due to tolls I had no way of knowing I had. All when I am barely working due to a recent injury. I have NO idea where to start, or who to call for help. Just that I have to find something, and fast. As a side note, it would appear I'm not the only person that this has happened to. I found [this]( article when I searched for similar situations.Summary:

Summarize: Your argument would be stronger with some examples but there's no doubting that countries will do what is in their interest. I've always thought of international relations as the supreme arena of hypocrisy. But international principles can still change the calculus that states have for determining their interests. While a stronger state might attack and annex a weaker one if they both existed in a vacuum, it might figure that the international condemnation it will likely get in the real world will not be worth the benefits accrued, and so may refrain. Countries take the trouble to find justifications for war because the principles I mentioned exist.Summary:
Summarize: This was one that turned me off of meeting people online for quite a while. This guy had a totally normal seeming profile, looked pretty cute, and was 6'4, so when after a few messages he asked if we could meet for a drink that night, and mentioned a dive bar a few blocks from my place, I figured I might as well grab a drink with him and see if we had chemistry in person. I got to the bar first, and when he walked in I instantly knew I wasn't interested. He was wearing massive hipster glasses that clashed with his face and weren't in any of his pictures, and was very oddly dressed - wearing a blazer and a massive wooden beaded necklace that reached his navel. Over the lapels of his blazer. I decided I would be polite and have one drink, and give him a chance. Conversation was like pulling teeth. I asked him about his beads - "Oh, I use those to pray." "Are you religious?" "No." When I asked what he did for a living he referred to himself as a 'haberdasher' who makes only spats. He also spent half the drink talking about an ex he pretty clearly wasn't over. When we finished our drinks, he suggested I should grab the next round. I started making some excuse about needing to go meet up with friends when he was like, "you're not into me are you?" I am a pretty honest person and I felt bad, so I said, "I'm really sorry, it was really nice to meet you, but I'm just not feeling the chemistry, I don't want to waste either of our time." "Well what did I do wrong?" An insanely bad question to ask during a date going south. It's not something I can critique, he needs to be himself and find someone who'll like him, and that wasn't me. I basically told him as much, to which he kept insisting he wanted "constructive criticism". When I kept refusing... "Well then I want my money for your drink back." I had ordered a $4 Guinness. I would have thrown a 5 at him and gotten out of there, but I didn't have cash, and he started insulting me for that, "Oh, it's so MATURE not carrying cash on a date!" At that point I was ready to get out of there and as I leave I hear him scream across the entire bar, "I'M FUCKING BROKE YOU BITCH!!!" A week later I get a message: "You owe me a drink, Nixon" (Nixon?? I still don't get it to this day.) I was mad enough that I responded, "You need to learn that buying someone a drink is not a contract for them to like you." I was about to block him but figured he'd respond with something entertainingly insane, and sure enough, two minutes later: "Well your beaver face was only worth one fuck with my big dick anyway" Comic gold. Almost made the whole date worth it.Summary:
Summarize: the tent has 10 weapon+tool slots. and 53 item slots and 3 backpack slots. as of now tents are buggy as hell. The contents of tents are saved on the server rather than the global hive server. never put a backpack full of stuff inside a tent. it will eat the contents of the bag usually. always put a test object in a tent like a bandage, then save, and wait for the server to restart (varies per server). if the bandage is still there then the tent is a good tent and doesn't eat your shit on restart, if not you can try the bandage again OR try to pack the tent up and go to a different server. rinse repeat. also if try to put something in a tent but it is full, it will NOT eat the item. it will drop it on the ground somewhere near by. protip: you can pretty much put a tent inside things like trees and rocks. this helps hide it BUT also makes it hard to get inside the tent. If you put it in the middle of the tent and it seems like you can't get in, go prone + first person and look at every inch of the tent usually the bottom corners.Summary:

Summarize: So luckily for you all, this fuck up happened on this day and doesn't involve sexy times with anyone. Just me being a general dumbass. So me and some friends decided to get some food before our next class we all had together at 1:15 so at about 12:45-ish we all piled into each other's cars and went to the nearest Taco Bell. I fucking love those cinnabon bites you can get there now... I think they're going to kill me one day but that's besides the point. I planned on sharing these nuggets of delicious, sugary goodness with my friends and they're only available in 2, 4, or 12, so basically a sample, a snack, or diabetes as your choices, but that's besides the point. Anyways, I'm getting a dozen to let my friends have some. We're inside Taco Bell, not the drive thru, because the car line looked rather long and it's fucking cold out so we all go inside. I go up first, my order is easy, just a 12 pack of cinnabon bites. This is where I fuck up. I look right at the lady and ask for a 12 pack (Taco Bell enthusiasts may know where this is going already) without missing a beat. I'm ready to get my little personal serving of 'Merica in a plastic cup and don't really think anything when the cashier asks me 'crunchy or soft?' Now I've ordered these bites in 12's before and really should've realized that was a weird question to ask for fried dough, but no, I'm a fucking retard and say, "wow didn't know you could do that... um, how bout soft?" so she rings me up, hands me the receipt and my card (important) and it says 12 fucking dollars on there. Um, they cost 4.50? So it's at this point I realize... oh shit, I just ordered one dozen soft tacos instead. Now this isn't a big deal, just take the tacos? But nah, I want my cinnabon bites and I'm determined to have my friends experience the foodgasm these will create upon touching our tongue. So as politely as I can (I work as a concessionist as my job so I try to be polite and not a hassle like some customers can be) I explain I've really screwed up on my order and it's my fault entirely. Could you give me a refund for this, I meant the cinnabon bites but didn't make that clear enough (because I'm a goddamn moron mind you). You'd think that'd be it but nope, it can't be that simple. This IS a fuck up after all, not just a minor mishap. So the cashier looks a bit befuddled and worried at once. She tells her manager, a shorter, stockier, younger woman complete with obviously fake colored hair and a massive attitude, she needs a refund. The manager looks like she's going to jump across the counter and fucking kill me. Now without looking directly at me, because that'd of course be way too rude and direct, she starts talking VERY loudly about how inconsiderate this is and how there's people waiting (I felt bad enough for keeping my friends and the assorted strangers waiting) but really was taken aback she was making this huge a deal out of this. A refund right? Well I paid with a card. And this manager doesn't know how to refund a card payment. And as far as I could tell only one of their registers was open so I'm holding up the whole line. (opening up another one isn't that easy, again concession experience) I feel so stupid now, but at the same time, I really couldn't help but wonder how you can earn the title of manager but not perform a card refund? My place of work, all managers and even some regular cashiers can perform refunds for customers. This manager had to call someone higher up, maybe customer service, shit I don't know, to tutorial her on how to do this refund. Meanwhile she's yelling to the back, do NOT make that dozen tacos, ay throw in a dozen cinnabons, while I'm standing off to the side letting other people get their orders out of the way. I feel like a really dumb shit, my friends think this whole ordeal is priceless, and I mean I'm not socially anxious, this is pretty funny, but I still felt bad for holding up the line. I overheard an older guy wondering why this woman couldn't just do the refund and made a public point of me being a detriment to the establishment or something but after quite a few more minutes, she rings up the refund, gets me some cinnabon bites and a reciept, all while looking super duper flustered. I don't think I've ever seen a human being so pissed off over dumbassery, it was just a mistake, allbeit a really stupid one. I felt a bit selfish for not just taking the tacos really but I work minimum wage and really didn't want to spend 12$ on food I didn't want and figured a refund would be a reasonable request. At the end of the ordeal, we were two minutes late for class (after intense reckless teenage driving) but I had the bites, the cinnamon sugar sprinkled food of the gods, and I was content.Summary:
Summarize: Sorry for this being so long winded) Ok, so everyone knows Africa is made up of mostly third-world countries. Common knowledge. So my idea is to provide a way to get Africa completely out of poverty, or at least as much as humanly possible. First, call up a world meeting, inviting all country leaders of the world, especially African leaders. In this meeting propose the idea for every other country to use Africa as a large scaled prison, based off the old British idea about Australia. There would be no guards in Africa, no rules, just the people placed there. The people who aren't criminals would be deported to another country or left there (I Know, I'm heartless). Then, if this idea is agreed upon by the leaders of the world, all high-level, extremely dangerous criminals would be sent to Africa as their life sentences. In time, (not sure how long) the mastermind criminals would band together and take over the continent of Africa.(Trust me, I'm going somewhere with this) Now that mastermind criminals are in charge of Africa, they might want to move into other countries, because they are evil and dangerous people. This will warrant other countries to wage war on the African continent. Within this war, countries could use nuclear weapons to wipe out the continent of Africa, due to the danger its putting on everyone else. After its been nuked, and the radiation has subsided to livable levels, the countries of the world would send their best scientists, architects, doctors, etc., to rebuild Africa, and repopulate it. With a little help from the rest of the world, Africa would become a first world continent.Summary:
Summarize: Those accu-check things are only to see if you're PISSING ketones, not whether you're ketogenic. The correlation is good for newbies, but poor for "veterans". After a few weeks/months you should be keto-adapted, which effectively means your body uses basically all the ketone bodies it produces. Early on your body produces excess ketones, this is what newbies call ketosis whereas it's actually ketonuria - ie your body discarding ketones because it hasn't established the required mechanisms to use them appropriately yet. If you want to know for sure, get a blood monitor - but FWIW after a while you just know whether you're ketogenic by the general feeling you have.Summary:

They also went on to get me arrest for theft by deception because something was marked wrong when the manager was dropping prices on everything and slapping on warranties to bring his numbers up in order to win a trip to the Superbowl. I sold a Mac Book to my aunt for next to nothing with a huge warranty on it. Mac Books all looked identical, and the manager even signed off on it. When they found out after inventory a few weeks later, he was on his trip to the Superbowl while the assistant manager demanded I get it back from my aunt who lived states away. When it didn't happen, I was arrested.Summary:

Summarize: I get a call from housekeeping about some crazy drunk girl knocking on the door to the HK laundry at 23:00 on Friday night. I put on my MOD jacket and call security to meet me at the scene. I find a 6'2" 40 something, who can't stand on two legs. She's banging on the door to the HK laundry room and screaming for someone to let her in. I asked, "can I help you ma'am?" She replies, "no, it's okay, I've been here for a while." I ask, "well if you've been here, can I look up your name and find your room, or if you are staying with someone else, can I have their name?" She gave me a confused look and then looked at the laundry room door like it had all the answers. She said, "I'm just gonna wait here for this door." I tried to reason with her until security showed up, at which point I said, "Ma'am, you are not making any sense at all. Unless you can you show me a room key, or tell me a name and room number for your friend, I need to ask you to leave the property." She decides to leave the property at this point, but she goes the long way through the parking lot. On the way, she thinks she is going to take a pit stop in the conference center via the handicap ramp. The security guard and myself both warn her not to go that way, but she does anyway and eats shit about two steps up the ramp. We help her to her feet, at which point she starts cussing us out and calling me a "rude son of a bitch," and then we set her in the chair in the carport. Since she fell, I had to try my best to take an incident report, but she refused medical services, she wouldn't give me her full name, or phone number, she would not, or could not tell me anything about herself or why she was at the hotel. I told her that I had to call either, a cab, the police or an ambulance for her. She didn't like any of those so I offered to let her use the desk phone (I'm a softy, I know), while she's calling her husband long distance on my phone, she continues on about how the staff at the hotel is so rude and she hasn't done anything wrong (queue the tears). I had originally offered to let her wait on my couch in front of the lobby, but after she called me a "sonnovabitch" the third time, I kicked her to the curb and told her that she could wait for her husband out there. She comes back inside ten minutes later with a room key and a name. "My friend is Jane Doe and this is her room!" This is where it gets interesting for me. I had dealt with Jane Doe earlier that day about some leftovers that housekeeping cleared. I offered her an appetizer at the restaurant to make up for it. Her reply was, "that's it?" I looked her room up and found out that she's staying on an employee rate for longer than the maximum number of nights that are allowed in a year. Now it's my job to be the asshole who makes sure that this employee is charged for the full amount due, and reported to the parent company and their employer about the misconduct of one of their friends. I don't want to be that person. Why do people need to make me that person.Summary:
Summarize: Did you not read the rest of my post? This is insane you obviously are a fucking uninformed ignorant fool. Some things are necessary and national defense is one of those things. The world isn't as simple as you seem to think, there are limited resources and other people will take them from you (or in this case us because we are talking about the defense of a nation). Without a collective defense program you wouldn't even be able to sit around bitching about your taxes, you would just be dead or paying taxes to a foreign government who has taken over your homeland. Take a history class and you will see that countries with resources that others want are going to have it taken from them if they don't defend themselves collectively. Unfortunately for you this means you pay for national defense even though you would rather live in some kind of anarchist society. What the fuck do you think would happen if we dismantled the US military? Hell at this point our military infrastructure alone would be reason for another country to invade, all sorts of countries and groups would literally kill for access to a nuclear missile silo. You can't have it both ways if you enjoy the protections provided by the government, which in this case you do because you live here, then you have to do your part. I feel like anybody who has a middle school education should know the realities of international war, namely that a fucking ar15 won't do jack. You might kill a couple people but they will eventually just drop a bomb on your house. And many of the things required for national defense are massively expensive, no individual can pay to develop and build a fighter jet but in a war situation they are vital, so without a government paying for it you are screwed.Summary:

Summarize: Here's my long rambling post. I'm sleepy but it should definitely make more sense than what some idiots are saying. Seriously, why are these MIDDLE-AGED ADULTS commenting on the educational system? THEY NEVER WENT THROUGH the system as it currently is and it's been a HELL OF A LONG TIME since they even WERE in a public education system. /puts up flame shield : There are many high school students (and college), and I know I’m one of them, who are much more intelligent, knowledgeable, and cultured than these “analysts” with degrees in an UNCOMPETITIVE FIELD from THIRD-RATE PODUNK UNIVERSITIES…an education PH.D from the University of Western North Dakota doesn’t mean shit, much less make sense. LISTEN TO THE GODDAMN STUDENTS. In one year, I’ll be able to vote for the fucking president, have sex, do anything legal that normal adults can do and you won’t even let me effect changes on something I HAVE FIRST HAND, FUCKING FRESH, experience with? Allowing senile bingo-addicted senior citizens to fuck my country's future because they're selfish and won't live to see any improvements is retarded. I know I’M smarter than a 5th grader unlike the mentally- atrophying cubicle-dwelling masses. As a student at a top-200 public high school, I say F--K the stupid, lazy, in-the-box teachers who are ruining the educational system. I have had a lot of great, awesome, inspiring, intelligent, wonderful, warm teachers. If performance were considered a factor, THESE PEOPLE WOULD BE GETTING REWARDED FOR THEIR EFFORTS INSTEAD OF BEING LUMPED TOGETHER WITH insert example of terrible teacher here There are right-wing teachers denouncing Obama’s socialist policies. HOW ABOUT YOU TAKE A FUCKING LOOK AT YOUR JOB: If we applied “competition” (key factor of capitalism in case you were dumb) to your jobs, there would be two possible paths: HELP your students actually have a future and GET PAID WELL FOR IT, or get fired and become homeless for being incompetent and having your salary go to good teachers. It’s called competition, and it should apply to more things. The only people who have more of an influence on children's education, no wait, A CHILD'S ENTIRE FREAKING LIFE = parents. However, nothing short of changing American culture and erasing the image of ("good at school" = nerd/loser) can change the parents. The teachers... we can change them. Also, don't spew bullshit about test-scores having nothing to do with teacher efficiency. Obviously, one should not compare the test scores of teachers at freaking Thomas Jefferson with those of teachers at an inner-city school. PUT YOUR GODDAMN COLLEGE DEGREES TO WORK AND CONSIDER SOMETHING CALLED RELATIVITY: Compare teachers AT A SINGLE SCHOOL. Pay them accordingly. Jesus Christ, is that so hard? Finally: Yeah, test scores aren't everything. People can point to Albert Einstein (LOOK HE WAS BAD AT SCHOOL). I guess you forgot to read the part where his brain has AN ENTIRE FUCKING PARIETAL OPERCULUM MISSING. I don't know what that is, but he’s missing a PART OF HIS BRAIN. The general consensus is that generally, HIGH TEST SCORES MEANS THAT ONE IS GENERALLY INTELLIGENT. "But ipiranga, you're making a lot of generalizations...DERPDERPDERP" ..."Because I'm talking about the education of children in an ENTIRE FUCKING NATION." I'm 17, a Junior in high school. MY CAPS LOCK KEY ISN'T ON, I'M HOLDING DOWN SHIFT BECAUSE THAT'S HOW MUCH I FUCKING HATE TEACHER-SYMPATHIZERS. STOP BEING SO LAZY, education reformers. INSTEAD OF USING YOUR UNIONS TO SAVE THE ASSES OF INCOMPETENT TEACHERS, ASK FOR BETTER WAGES FOR THE BETTER TEACHERS. Michelle Rhee had it right. FUCK TENURE, FUCK SITTING ON YOUR ASSES. Solution: It’s not simple. Fuck tenure. Pay effective teachers more (based on relative standings at a school). If there are 4 American History Teachers, give the one with the best scores (over a period of time) more money. Fire the incompetent one if he continuously fails to improve test scores. It’s FUCKING RELATIVE. If there’s only one teacher, look at the district. IMPORTANT: TRY AND CHANGE AMERICAN CULTURE TO VALUE SMART, HARD-WORKING PEOPLE. MAKE TEACHING A VALUABLE PROFESSION. In other cultures, teachers are as highly regarded as doctors. If we clean up our educational system and fire the slackers, the same will happen here.Summary:

They then stay at this point indefinitely or until they get fired(or relationship is ended).Summary:
Summarize: It is a pejorative for selling that which should not be sold, selling to those that should not be sold to, and going to lengths to make oneself attractive specifically to those that should not be attracted. This applies to male prostitutes as well. "Whore" is usually used synonymously with "slut." Whatever else the words mean, they are widely held to be a way of "shaming" assertive women, particularly those who are sexually assertive. I appreciate that this is what you mean when you say, "whore," it is not what the majority of people will think when they read it. Combined with her level of sexual activity and whatever she may or may not get in return for it being completely irrelevant to her appalling crime, it sounds like you're not just "slut-shaming" (god I hate that phrase but it's appropriate here, in that I'm pointing out what others, especially women, will infer) but piling on as well. >And you mean to tell me you'd not have called me out for calling her that?! I don't believe that for a microsecond. Probably. But I think the part you're missing here is that I'm not trying to "call you out"-- I personally took no offense. I'm trying to call your attention to how your words come across. >it is horribly offensive for you to reduce this cause to that of a PR campaign. I didn't mean to "reduce" it to anything. Everything you just mentioned will only be gotten through winning hearts and minds, both of men and women who have been fed this kind of thing so long that the men's rights stances on these issues, as sane and rational as they are, seem like extremist anti-women positions. You guys need to get more men on your side than just the ones who have been through the hell of a false rape accusation, losing their kids, or being taken to the cleaners in divorce court.Summary:
Summarize: When I was 8 my parents decided to have the sex talk with me. They sat me down and described it as a really big, long hug with someone you love very much. To this day I honestly cannot hug anyone without feeling i am being molested or molesting someone.Summary:
Summarize: To be honest you should try to take most tier lists with a grain of salt, a lot of times it's the player's opinion rather than them doing a ton of research. Really you shouldn't listen to tier lists, rather find your own champion and learn everything about them then play champs that are similar, if you listen to things like tier lists and counter pick websites you'll end up not doing as well due to your own lack of knowledge with the champ. With that being said Trundle is a great duelist and arguably top three in terms of sustain (Mundo,Renekton,Trundle) out of the meta top lane picks. He's got a strong laning phase against melee's who rely on AD, most of the time you'll want to be split pushing with him as he takes towers insanely quickly. Although he has mana, as long as you use you're skills wisely you should never oom. In terms of jungling he's like the inverse of Elise and Olaf, while Elise/Olaf are great laners they're so much better in the jungle, it's inverse for trundle. He needs a laner's farm, prefers to be dueling other champions, and his clear speed really isn't all that great (mostly single target with a high cooldown steroid early), couple that with the rise of early game pressure junglers (Pantheon/Kha/Elise/Vi) and theirs really no point in not putting him in a solo lane.Summary:

Summarize: In 1972 my parents got married, they divorced in 1979 - my dad cheated. They both remarried: My dad remarried 3 more times but didn't have any more children (his other wives always had kids). My mom remarried and had two boys. My mom's husband died in 2002 (he was a good man) and for some reason around June 2009 she started asking me about my dad; how he's doing, do I think he would be interested in meeting up with her? (WTF?) I don't ask my dad anything (I know him, he'll shoot down the idea immediately) but I casually start mentioning my mom in conversations again. My mom gets impatient with me and calls my dad herself and asks him to meet her. They meet, it goes ok, but my dad says he's not "really" interested. She is persistent and about month later I find they are living together. They got married last week.Summary:
Summarize: Me and my girlfriend have been in a six month relationship, before this relationship we had basically had no sexual experience. Now six months in we both have exchanged oral and explored our sexual sides. My gf has recently showed interest in "playing rough" after a mutual friend talked to us about how much him and his girlfriend love it. We have done some things, we both really enjoy biting each others necks/ears, she loves it when I bite her breasts, and I when she digs her nails into my back. My problem lies in what to do beyond what is listed above, she really wants to try, but I'm not sure what else to do nor the intricacies of some of the more obvious ones(hair pulling).Summary:
Summarize: At first I thought I was a normal kid but then a parcel was delivered to my house. I did not know what type of parcel it could be because I did not order any parcels. By the way it was delivered by an Amazon drone which was euphoric because it droned the shit out of me. Then I opened the parcel and there was a fedora in it, a nice black fedora. I put it on my head and hoped my penis would grow but instead of the growth of my penis my autism was triggered. I have not been the same ever since.Summary:
Summarize: The Republicans are stubborn when it comes to taxing the upper 2% of Americans, and insist on taxing the working class. I have no prior knowledge of economics, and I am only in high school, but it makes complete common sense to reduce taxes on the working class so they will buy more goods and stimulate the economy, and gently tax the rich to cover the tax reductions. I don't think Republicans understand that if the economy is shit and our country goes bankrupt, they won't have a job. Trust me, I am really not trying to be biased, but its hard with all the stupid bullshit that's going on over in the right side of congress. That is all.Summary:
Summarize: Could there be a difference in the "fuck"? Perhaps one can gain and give away a "social fuck"- empathy, sympathy, etc to others.. while one's "self fuck(s)" can be either only dispensed toward oneself.. or may be transferable when really wanting to allot a "fuck" to someone else.. As far as I know, you can see when someone gives a "fuck" in your situations. Perhaps, you should make A concerted effort to disperse your "self fucks to send them to someone else..Summary:
Summarize: Shit man, i do this with games too. I bought mgs4 on day one, played for like 30 minutes and never touched it again, traded it for fallout3, played for like 1 hour and that's it. Bought the orange box, played ep1 for a little bit and that's it. Played two levels of portal, a little tf2 but never played again. Bought sly cooper 2 because i loved the first one, it's sitting there collecting dust. Shadow of the colossus, i managed to get up to the 10th boss after two years. A big part of the problem is Cod4, it ruined every other game for me, that's all i play, And sf hd remix. I have lost my patience to play campaign modes in games, i'd rather just shoot and knife people.Summary:
Summarize: I posted on r/occult last week, but i don't know of any other subreddit that could do this interpretation thing justice. i will try to describe this recent dream i had as well as i can. I just woke up about 10 minutes ago, so its still kinda fresh. So there was a lot of stuff going on at the same time in my dream. first, i was in a starbucks coffee place ordering a coffee and i kept having a weird conversation with the barista. don't remember the details, but i do remember that i would unconsciously stare at him in a menacing way while he was working, and he would stare right back. i would blink back to consciousness within the dream and apologize or shake it off. (I used to work at a Starbucks). Then, i started seeing messages within certain objects and stuff, for example i saw some 'occult' message within a worn-down warning label on a debit card machine. i then went to the middle of the coffee shop, and sat next to a table, and i had the overwhelming feeling that people thought i was stoned or something, and thats why i was acting so weird. There was this girl there too, getting a coffee with her boyfriend or something. She notices me and i start talking to her about stuff. i get my coffee and we go out the door. meanwhile i am talking about how its weird that nothing really exists on its own, in its own right, like how the sidewalk is just a thought in our mind and is built on the feelings we have of walking on it, etc. She heads down the street with her boyfriend, leaving me behind to think about this stuff on my own. then, basically everything dissolves and im looking at my neuronic pathways and brain matter and ideas. i am massaging these ideas in order to relax them, relax my mind, and expand my mind to a deeper place. it feels like a muscle, sort of. maybe a muscle of information. The next few things are a bit blurry, but i will try to recount them as best i can. few things first. these are some things that i was thinking about and that shaped my dream. my grandfather died last week, and i just saw the dark knight rises yesterday. I have been reading the invisibles by grant morrison and also prometheus rising. Ok. so i remember someone was standing on a cliff looking down and there was an immense drop down an unbelievably dark cavern below. dark, grey colours. someone was filming him standing on a thin ledge getting as close as possible to the edge. then a lot of things happen. i get a very very strong pull towards feeling this connection/undercurrent of my life and it is trying to tell me something. this intuition pulls connections together and i realize that the theme is death. i hear it as all these feelings and themes and pictures of the invisibles comic and dark knight movie and prometheus rising thinking this book is genius all together (felt like i was recounting specific instances in my recent life that were meaningfully connected to this idea) while i piece together the sentence; death. and rebirth. rise from the ashes. I realize i have to die and be reborn, so i let go. I have now let my 'ego' die. i am now barely conscious and i can feel/hear myself talking in my sleep. it honestly felt like there was some sort of demon or evil-ness in my body. my voice is calling out for my brother for help, and it seriously sounds like a demon. its not my voice. theres two different pitches to it, high and low pitch, super scary. i then wake up from this state, and feel good. i still feel like im dreaming, and i am hyper aware of by bedroom and my body. ok. that's the gist of it, i think. there was a lot more to the dream than i have written, i just wrote the stuff i remembered. and im not a good writer anyways. sorry. but if anyone could help me understand what the fuck just happened, please do! ill try to remember more details if i recall them. thanks!Summary:
Summarize: Well they're being rude and getting in your space. Why you trying to help these assholes by teaching them something?

Summarize: I am in Silver 1 and really trying to get to Gold but it is even harder whenever people simply quit due to some people talking to you in a "rude" way. It's the internet! I won't sugarcoat this and I will say that sometimes I'm that person that tells you, "Dude seriously, dont try 1v5 the team, have some map awareness ffs". Then, let's say in this scenario, the person gets butthurt and says something along the lines of "I'm not having fun anymore, just gonna feed, f*** this trash team", when we were only 5-12 (We could still comeback). In the end, if the person is harassing you, there is always an ignore button (Of course there is a fine line between telling you what to do in a "rude" way and actually bullying you). Another subject is when jungler takes blue from an 0-4 mid, obviously, the mid will just feed it to the enemy mid and keep matters worse but what does our mid do when this happens? "Omg, jungler didnt give me blue gg afk". Just bothers me that people wont take ranked as seriously as I do and simply give up or quit when things look rough.Summary:
Summarize: You know what though? If you break the law, you go to jail. Its that simple. If you're overseas, and you break their laws... ...you go to jail. Usually overseas. It's not difficult to understand. Pussy Riot are obviously bending and breaking laws all the time, so what do you expect? They deserve to be in jail because they broke the law. They deserve to be in a Russian jail because they were stupid enough to go to Russia, and break Russian laws. I'm not saying that Russian jails are fair, or humane...and I'm not saying they aren't. In all honesty, I don't know. I'm not Russian. But that's why I wouldn't risk it like these people did. Do they deserve the treatment they have received in jail? Probably not. But they made conscience decisions to end up there. So its their on stupid fault.Summary:
Summarize: Welcome to America, Columbus. Alcohol companies and Prisons. Marijuana became illegal in the 30's because it was perceived as the drug of choice by blacks and hispanic populations. Nixon my personal favorite president <sarcasm> started the war on drugs 'cause he didn't like those damn hippies and thats what they were smoking. I am not advocating the use of marijuana, but it is incredibly expensive to incarcerate people for a victimless crime. Studies have shown that alcohol is much more dangerous.

Summarize: How DARE gay people not want straight people in gay spaces that they feel safe in all the time! Most gay folks are more than happy to have straight people come in as the OP of the thread said, but the nasty truth is, sometimes gay people just want to be around other gay people. It's not really a sex thing (although that's part of it) - its a culture thing. I mean, think of it this way: for the sake of example, let's say you're a member of Faith A, and you've been invited to visit your Faith B friend's house of worship. You're welcome to come as a guest, listen, observe, be polite, etc. In fact, most places will welcome you with open arms. But let's say that you start inviting more and more of your Faith A friends to this Faith B house of worship, because you enjoy it so much. At what point does it cease to be a space for Faith B people? There are no gay houses of worship, and the cultural centers are few and far between and usually only in major cities. For gay folks, gay bars serve this purpose - as a community center, as a place to be themselves in their culture, and yes, as a place to meet like-minded people. They're really vital. And having a drunk bachelorette party there to gawk at the sideshow really dehumanizes gays in their own space.Summary:
Summarize: Has had to become callous to survive" what a load of shite. Unless his job is to decide which one out of a hundred babies survives the grinding machine so that we may still eat and survive a dystopian future in which we can't grow crops or whatever, this is an excuse and a copout. His completely voluntary callousness is simply due to his inability and unwillingness to deal with stuff in his life.Summary:
Summarize: So I went on a date with this girl everything was great. Cool girl and it was a pretty solid first date. I flirted with her over text a lot and she seemed interested until a couple days ago. (Our first date was last week) She told me that she doesn't want a relationship because she's going off to college and she wants to enjoy her senior year with no worries. Also I just got out of a LTR and im not looking for a relationship either. Sounds great right? Perfect FWB situation. But she doesn't want that either. She's the type of girl who is religious and doesn't want just a fling. She told me that if it wasn't senior year and she wasnt going off to college she would be trying hard to be my girlfriend. Is it bad timing or did I screw it up and she's sugar coating it?Summary:

Summarize: Update to previous post It turns out that "murderer" was on his first day back after a stroke so that kind of explains why he is what I call a "cutter" So now I feel bad for being rash with him. [Episode 1]( So today was my first official day on the job after being essentially a non-paid intern for 4 days. It started off as any day at a normal office. Arrived at the office nice and early with my coffee and bagel in hand. I walked inside, signed in, went to the office to my brand new shiny desk, and sat down and just took it all in as I gently sipped my coffee of the gods and said hello to the only other IT "tech" there already. Of course I am referring to my new friend, the IT punching bag. Turns out that punching bag has a name... "USER" as in Ultra Stress/Stupidity Elevation Reliever. The day was pretty low key. I said the words "off", "and", and "on" about 5 dozen times, imaged a network drive for myself, and took a gander at the server room. Although I am skilled in hardware, high level software, java, javascript, html5, and C++ I suck at managing servers. I know what each physical part does, but the actual managing of servers as in dealing with hundreds of client requests that change every 2 seconds is not my forte so that is why I am glad it is not in my job description. ANYWAYS... So about an hour after lunch I get a ticket from the security guys. It read as follows... "One of our cameras is out, picture not moving" I grabbed my trusty screwdrivers (I always take a philip's head and flat head when I take any kind of ticket what so ever because you never know) and went down to the security department. Now there are certain areas under constant PTZ camera surveillance. This case is the motor pool because it is a razor wired area in which we park our propane trucks. (I just realized that I forgot to mention that the place I work at distributes propane to many states) So I get down there and take a look. The fat guard (FG) shows me the issue. FG : See I press the button to pan the camera right, left, up, and down and nothing happens. But when I press zoom it zooms. He proceeds to show me and sure enough he is correct, however, I notice that something doesn't look right when he zooms in. Me : Here let me take a look. I fiddle with the controls and check the logs. Sure enough the commands are sent without error. hmmm odd. Did you try (the slogan of every IT tech in the world) turning it off and back on again? FG : Yes. Holy shit, wasn't expecting that answer I go outside and take a look and what I expected was the issue was indeed. Someone had pulled a prank and taped a picture of the lot over the lens. I radioed FG to pan the camera just to check that it was indeed working and thank god it was. I call out FG to show him the prank. He has a good laugh. (the motor pool in question is usually empty because it is used to park the broken down trucks, but our mechanics are so efficient that there is hardly ever anything in the lot) As I reach up to yank off the photo this humorous ticket turned idiot faster than a DDR3 RAM swap. FG : I can't let you do that. You don't have security clearance to physically alter the cameras. Me : scoff ya and you don't have the clearance to fit in a desk chair with arms. You guys are hilarious reaches for the photo again FG : Halt, I am serious you do not have clearance to physically alter cameras Professor_Derpsalot! You can only fix software issues. Me : I am not even going to touch the camera, just the paper scotch taped onto it. FG : I can't let you. Me : Well then who in Eternia has the clearance? A-thank you FG : I'm gonna go call the company listed electrician to do this. Me : Umm okay, you do that I am going to be right back. I then went and had a nice "chat" with my good friend USER and returned. By the time I had returned the electrician had already arrived and it took him an entire 10 minutes of checking in, taking a look, writing a summary of what is wrong and what he will do, turning it into the security department head, yanking off the piece of paper, and checking out. And of course he probably charged for an hour of work time. I am glad this job is easy, but for the love of all that is 0 and 1 what is with "non-techies"?Summary:
Summarize: First, you do realize that you are the one slandering him and he kept his views on your racism private and just banned you and only mentioned it in mod mail when you asked why he banned you, right? Do you feel a tad hypocritical. This guys an ass, but he just banned you, you've obsessively stalked him. Second, I can't read the post since you didn't link to it, but the title does sound racist. Why mention that someone of African descent attacked the girl? Why not just say a girl was attacked for wearing a crucifix? Does it actually matter that it was by someone of "African descent?" Also, do you realize that "African descent" is almost always not the right way to refer to a black person unless you're referring to someone who literally migrated from Africa in their lifetime and are acting in a way informed by that? Giving you the benefit of the doubt I'd imagine it's just a misstep, but realize that specifically calling out race is race-bating a bit when it has nothing to do with it. Why not call out the other kids religion? This is like saying the girl was attacked by someone of Irish descent...unless it's a protestant/Catholic English/Irish related attack it serves no fucking purpose. You should ask yourself why you'd mention someone of African descent and not if they were of Irish descent.Summary:

Summarize: Ok Reddit, I'm an exchange student from Sweden this year in the U.S. And I really like it here except for a few things, and a major problem is my brother is a complete asshole. Now don't get me wrong, he's nice every now and then, but his personaloty really shines when he's around 1 or more friends with me. They always make fun of me, my country, and he says that I'm weird a lot too, thought not directly. Some examples: -you just radiate virginity -I hope I walk in to your room one day to see that you hanged yourself, so I can punch you in the balls and laugh. -Swedish people don't have any fucking common sense shit the fuck up Swed (this one is used a lot of the time by him and some of his friends) A lot of these are targeted towards how my communicative skills are lacking, I haven't really been socially active until this last year because of my self confidence have always been low. Some of it I because our countries and cultures are different which he demeans me for every chance he gets because he thinks he is always right. One thing that gets to me really bad is that he also gets mad whenever I ask him anything and then when he sees I'm mad he just makes some jokes and I laugh, and he thinks it's all cool, but I just about had it now. Now I don't have trouble with being with mine/his friends alone, I can make jokes with them and him but every now and then the delivery is off, or in most cases when we're in large groups, they will talk about stuff I have no fucking clue about so I can't really say anything and just look awkward. Keep in mind these people live in a small county so they have all lived with each other for about 15 years already which makes it kinda awkward for me. One thing makes it even worse, I can't get anywhere without him because way out of walking range from everyone else, and I can't drive while I'm here. On a positive note, all of my friends are his friends because that's how I met them at first. So I guess to sum it upSummary:
Summarize: I was 25 at the time and had divorced a few months prior. After my divorce I went into full manwhore mode. I'm a decent looking dude, 6'1", 205#, dirty blonde hair, blue eyes, I'm no gym rat but I have a job that keeps me active all day and in good shape. I'm 3rd wheeling it at a bar with my friend and his GF. We are getting shitty drunk (an every night thing for me at the time) and his GF says "I think my friend is coming to hang out with us." Cool, the more the merrier. About 20 minutes later her friend shows up. We will call her T, for the sake of anonymity. T is about 5"2 in heels, 100#, fiery green eyes, and a strawberry blonde. She was a solid 8.5 on a 10 scale when sober. In my condition she looked like an eleventeen. She orders up a vodka and red bull, and I exchange my empty beer for a fresh one. All 4 of us are chatting and laughing. And I noticed she touched my arm when she laughed...always a good sign. By the end of that round my friend and his GF wanted to shoot some pool. They get up to go grab a rack of balls and pick out some cues. As they left the table she leaned over, put her hand in my crotch and started rubbing my dick. She looks me in the eyes and smirks. "Follow me". Being the gentleman I am I oblige without question. She grabs her purse and leads me to the women's bathroom. Well by this time the fuckstick is at full mast and we go into the handicap stall. I close the door and lock it and she sits down on the toilet. I walk over and she unbuckles my belt, unbuttons my jeans, pulls down my boxers and starts giving me some violent head. She is deep throating and gagging. Spitting on my dick and jerking with the fervor of a porn starlet. She has my undivided attention. She pulls my member out of her mouth and asks if I have a condom as she continues stroking my crank. FUCK! "Nope, but I can go get one." She reaches for her purse sitting on the railing and fishes one out. Perfect! She hikes up her dress and pulls off her lacy little black thong to reveal a beautiful slick shaven pussy with a finger-width landing strip. She throws the soaked panties in her purse. She stands up, turns around and has one foot on the floor and her knee on the toilet seat. There, in all of its glistening glory, was my perfectly presented prize. I push myself into her and she starts cooing. I'm in awe that I'm full on fucking some woman that I've known for the course of a beer...fuck it. Trim is trim, and I'm in. I'm balls deep in T and rage fucking this girl. Balls slapping clit, she's moaning, and the rougher I get the more she soaks my rod and wails. She's a screamer. I give zero fucks at this moment. I hear the bathroom door opening and closing, toilets flushing, hand dryers cycling on and off...it doesn't phase me one bit. At times I hear women's voices...not T's and some are whispering, some laughing...I don't pay attention or acknowledge their words. I am completely zoned in on fucking the living shit out of T. It could have been two minutes since we began, it could have been an hour. Time was lost to me at this point and in my condition. She's moaning and screaming to god...there is no god here, only a sexually explosive man in the throes of a post divorce, self serving, fuckstravaganza. She lunges forward as I feel myself crashing into her cervix...she is trembling and shaking and tells me she wants me to come in her mouth. "Turn around". I rip off the condom dripping with her juices and shove my lube and precum covered dick into her mouth. She starts bobbing her head and fiddling with my balls...wham! I come like the fury of 1000 badgers spun out on crank, deep in her throat. She half chokes, half coughs, and the next wave of semen comes pouring from my member into her mouth. She continues to stroke me and squeeze my throbbing dick and coax every last drop from me. "Fuck yes! Let's get a drink and go shoot some pool!" She said through smiling lips, my once erect member shrinking in her hand. I pull up my boxers and my jeans as she takes a quick piss. She dries off and stands up. "I'm not putting my panties back on, they're soaked and I would just have to take them off again when we get home in a while." I wash my hands and as we exit the women's bathroom. There stands my buddy with a full on shit-eating grin, his girlfriend, and half a bar-full of strangers. My buddy hi-fives me and everyone is laughing cheering and clapping. I exclaim "who needs a beer? I need a smoke!" T was smiling and laughing, she wasn't embarrassed in the least. We stayed at that bar until closing. I got my tab for the night and it was only 12 bucks. The bartender said that a bunch of people were paying for my beers all night. And that I better not pull that shit again in his place. Fair enough. T and I were fuck buddies for a while but that all ended when she caught up to me at the same bar and I was with another woman. She got pissed and dramatic, and went completely left when I reminded her that told her I didn't want anything exclusive.Summary:
Summarize: Back in 2005 (3rd grade), this kid (let's call him John) started riding my bus. He, a couple of other people, including my future boyfriend, and I became pretty good friends throughout elementary school, into middle school, and even today in high school. John got closer to me in 2011 (6th grade) just by talking about books and video games. However, this friendship started moving off the bus and into the classroom. He would sit with me during lunch and during class, but my naive self didn't think anything of it. A year later was the first time he asked me out. My friends had been teasing me for months about him, but I insisted it was just platonic. He proved me wrong when he slipped a note in my locker telling me how pretty I was, along with a pen with a plastic parrot on top (how romantic; in his defense, the pen was a pretty hot item at the Scholastic Book Fair). In response, I wrote a note explaining while I was flattered, I wasn't interested and gave the parrot back. After this first attempt I could tell something was wrong. John was a bit moody and we distanced a little, but he came back a couple of months later and we were friends again, just not as close as before. The next year, I started dating a family friend who went to a different school. Eight months later, I broke up with him because he cheated on me. John and another friend from the bus, let's call him Andy, immediately told me he was an asshole and didn't deserve me. Two years later, 2013/sophomore year, he asked me out to go see a movie. I was completely taken by surprise and I had no idea what to say, but I didn't want him to be upset so I told him that it wasn't a good time. To be fair, I was having a lot of family problems and I really didn't want to date anyone at the time, but no matter what I didn't want to date him. I could tell he was a bit upset but that could be expected. Less than two weeks later, I started dating Andy. John was PISSED because he and Andy hated each other (ironically, they're both extremely similar). John didn't speak to me for the duration of the relationship. Andy told me that it was because John was jealous; he revealed to me that he and his friends had known John had liked me since third grade. At the end of Andy and I's relationship, John started saying that Andy was a sociopath: he was manipulative, he was dating me just to spite John, he was just trying to sleep with me. To be fair, Andy might very well be a sociopath but you can see where I might see a red flag or two. We broke up soon afterward and John made sure to be there for me, though I was clear that it definitely not a good time. This year, 2014, John's becoming more persistent. He tried making a move on my best friend (also not interested and looks EXACTLY like me). He's given me gifts. He's texting me more often, often texting again after a couple of hours wihout me replying his original text. He's offerer beating up the asshat that tried to touch me. He's asked me out 3 times in a matter of months. Each time I brush it off, never flat out saying "I don't like you, leave me alone," but I'm getting to my wits end. I don't know how he can't get the hint: he ALWAYS texts me first; I NEVER give him a straight answer as to plans; I avoid any contact that might be considered intimate; I've dated multiple guys that I haven't even mentioned here. I don't want to be an asshole, I don't want to do it over text, and I don't want him to blow up, but I'm not interested. What do I do?Summary:
Summarize: Gullible people. In 2nd, 3rd... generation immigrants, some have a "stuck in two worlds" feeling where they are too Muslim to be part of the west and too western to be a good Muslim. This makes people desperate for community, and since these guys have extremist groups with a cause to turn to, they go and join. Plus they get to shoot guns. The same thing happens in America. The immigrants who come here are often willing to work for low wages in sub-standard conditions. When their children grow up with an idea of what being successful in America looks like, yet have a low chance of achieving success, they get involved in violence and gangs. Plus they get to shoot guns.Summary:
Summarize: In weight training, to get better at a particular movement, you start at a low weight and do it a lot of times until you can do more weight. I try to put that into practice in most everything I do. Don't know much about the ancient Assyrians? Read a book with a wide scope, and narrow it down. Wanna learn to fold awesome origami? Start with the easiest thing and work your way up. Makes a lot of sense, doesn't it? Now I want to do the same with human beings. I want to get better at interacting with people, and to be more precise, at picking up women. But I don't know how to improve my skills. And I have no foundation to build from. Obviously, a lot of interaction and pick-up attempts and failing over and over again will lead to one getting better at it, but it's seems a bit shitty to me. When it came to weight training, I did a lot of reading before starting out to lay a solid foundation of knowledge so that I'd know beforehand what to do and not to do. And once I came around to actually starting out, I started with a low weight and worked my way up. Trying to randomly interact with people seems like a whole lot of stabbing in the dark. When it comes to people, I have virtually no foundation. I was a weird kid - fat, ugly and dorky so I never had many friends, and thus missed out on a lot of crucial social practice. I assume there's not gonna be much useful theory behind interaction because people's psyches are a lot more fickle than their muscles. I'm a shitty conversationalist and boring as all hell and don't know how to improve that. I just... I dunno. Is there a way of getting better at these sorts of things without basically trying everything out? Social aficionados, I'd love to hear you out.Summary:
Summarize: You might have seen some of my posts complaining about how crap and overpriced I personally believe the Outer Rimjob DLC to be. Well you'll be happy to know, I've been well and truly punished for my opinion. I bet Prince_Shaar will be pleased. On its Tuesday launch, I was on the PS store season pass page making a video to send to my friend at work. I was screwing around, putting a nerd voice on to mimic the youtube gaming community, asking why anyone in their right mind would pay £40 for this pile of junk. I clicked on the 'purchase' button as a joke, knowing there needed to be a second screen before the transaction went through. At this point I was pretending to buy it, with the intention of pulling out and teasing DICE with my patronage. When lo and behold, my fiancée bust into the living room and gave me such a fright I dropped the controller, and by some inexplicable twist of fate, the x button was pressed as it bounced off the sofa. The loading purchase screen kicked in, I scrambled to hit cancel, but it was too late. 'Transaction successful.' I am now a horrified season pass owner of a game I've spent the last few weeks lambasting. How do I feel about this? Pretty appalled, but at the same time amused. Does anyone know if there's an option on settings to password protect transactions and prevent this kind of 'easy purchase' from happening again? I'm imagining a situation where I invite people round for dinner and their kids go on the playstation. The way it's currently set up, they could effectively bankrupt me in the space of a few hours. I suppose there's always a guest account option. Anyway, looks like you're stuck with me for the duration of the season pass ride - lets see what mediocre shit gets thrown our way over the coming year. My thoughts so far... complete waste of money and dead rancor was certainly a missed opportunity. ;)Summary:

Summarize: So we know with two books left things are going to have to start wrapping up. This will likely lead to many deaths and many alliances of major characters. Although nothing is certain I feel safe saying the Others marching on the wall (i.e. The war of R'hllor vs The Great Other) is the major final climax of the books. Keep in mind this theory requires several other theories to hold true (Stannis = Night's King [sorta], Jon lives/is resurrected...Danny will some day finally make it to Westeros). That being said I have been speculating where loyalties will fall during my reread of the novels and I think the values and morals of the characters provide a great hint as to who will side where. Stannis is described as being just but harsh. He tells Davos that a good act does not wash out a bad one. Using Davos as an example Stannis punishes him for being a smuggler but rewards him for saving the men at Storm's End with onions. He can be extreme at times but he understands a man can be good AND bad. I will call this POV team-grey Mellisandre explains her perspective on men to Davos using a metaphor about rotten onions. Not the exact quote but "If an onion is half rotten it is a rotten onion. A man is good or a man is bad". For this type of POV I'll call it team-black/white. You can already see where I am going with this. I do not expect Stannis and Mellisandre to stay on the same team for very long. Although I am unsure of the exactly how Stannis will "break" I have a favourite theory: Stannis returns from the Winterfell to the Wall. Mellisandre has either revived Jon Snow/will revive him soon. Regardless, her revival of Jon Snow will cause her to interpret Jon Snow as AA. This "betrayal" as Stannis will likely perceive it will leave him lost, confused, hopeless, and cold. Out of the 3 Baratheons, Stannis has been described as the "Stannis is iron, hard and brittle, he'll break before he bends" If Mel now pushes for Jon as AA she will most likely as Stannis to "serve" in some way or another. Stannis will not bend the knee or his will to anyone else and I think this leads to him fulfilling his role as the new Night's King (this obviously assumes there will be another nights king but I believe that in Danny's HotU vision Stannis is the Blue-eyed king that casts no shadow) So that is how/why Stannis and Mel will be pitted against each other in the War of the Gods. However they will not be alone. While Danny is in Meereen she asks Ser Barristan to tell her about those who betrayed her family. Barristan has a hard time explaining to her that while Ned Stark was a rebel, he was a good man. Stating how King Robert wanted Danny dead but Ned would rather denounce his title of King's Hand than help murder a child. However, Danny says they are all "Usurpers dogs" and categorizes anyone who helped lend a hand in the rebellion to be equally guilty. This seems to be very consistent will Mel's philosophy on team-black/white. It just so happens that Danny has 3 fire breathing dragons and Mel worships the Red God of light and fire. It seems fairly likely these two would cooperate well together. Last for now is Jon Snow. Jon's morals and ethics happen to be my favourite in the book. I think he handles difficult situations very well, and can make the tough decisions that need to be made. In a SOS Sam chapter Sam asks Jon if there "could be honour in a lie if it were told for a good purpose" to which Jon responds "it would depend on the lie, and the purpose, I suppose". So here we see that Jon can still find honour in something other people would say "no its not honourable because its a lie." I think this plus the ole baby-switcheroo he pulls on Mance's and Gilly's sons shows he would play for team-grey. Stannis may not be willing to bend to Jon Snow and Mel may drive Stannis away but that does not mean Jon and Stannis could not work together for some common-cause. We already know Stannis at least respects Jon Snow and his style of command judging from the stern head nod after Jon took Janos Slynt's head (cue fist pump!). And just because Mel may want Jon to be AA does not mean Jon will listen to her. He is already suspicious of her to begin with. Mel could try to pull off the Stannis-to-Jon switch and just botch the whole thing, pissing them both off, and causing Stannis and Jon to team and and Mel to look for a new warrior for R'hllor (aka Danny). How and why Jon and Stannis would fight for/with the others, I am not sure. There are still two full books filled with game-changing information that we do not have yet. However, based on certain characters morals I think when the fate of the world is on the line people will truly side with what they feel is just. So what do you guys think? Please dissect as much as you'd like and point out any mistakes or flaws you feel I've made or help reinforce my theory if you think I've missed anything that may help add to it!Summary:

He finally found out by being a POS, he cheated on his girlfriend and broke up with her the next day. Lived the "single and always down to fu...meangle" life.

Summarize: I once had to take a friend of mine to the hospital after he came down with a serious case of tonsilitis. He could talk, but when he did it sounded as if his mouth were coated in peanut butter and his tongue had given up on him, so I escorted him there as a comfort and in order to help do the talking. When we arrived at the hospital I asked the nearest staff member, a security guard, to direct us to the pediatric ward (at the time we were freshmen in college and he was 17). As we started to walk away (but still in ear shot of the guard) my friend asked me in his golden retriever-with-three-tennis-balls-in-his-mouth voice which way we were going. Before I could answer, the guard came bounding after us, and giving my friend a sideways glance whispers to me if I needed a 'special needs' attendent to accompany us during our visit. I simply said "No, after having been with him this long, I've got this" and we giggled all the way the kiddie ward.Summary:
Summarize: So this happened the other day actually, but friday was my birthday (dancing queen, young and sweet, only 17), and I planned on having a pretty cool birthday party on Saturday. Pizza, cake, video games, the works. The thing is, most of my friends graduated last june, so i dont have much for friends, except my Youth Group that i attend after school. So me being the lonely little shit that I am, invite my Youth Group friends, about 10-13 16 and 17 year olds, a good party. Except, as I was handing out invitations, a few kids said they had to work that weekend, but "they'd try to make it." Another thing to mention is that these kids all live in town, and I live out in the country, and its about a half hour drive. I drive it twice a day 4 times a week, shouldnt be a problem for these guys. Anyways, as the week before my birthday went on, I was getting increasingly nervous, and anxious, and scared, because what if they dont want to come? what if they cant come? what if no one shows up? So finally wednesday rolls around, after youth group, driving a girl to her house afterwards. I casually ask if her and her brother, another invitee, will be showing up friday night, and she says maybe. Her and her friend that drives her everywhere were "fighting" at the time, so she didnt know if she could get a ride. I say okay, say I'd talk to her tomorrow, drive away and lose. My. Shit. I'm driving, I'm bawling my eyes out, I'm yelling at myself and hitting myself and asking myself why I'm so dumb and why i would even consider having a party when I'm stupid and gross and nobody likes me anyways. I get home, snapchat everyone "partys cancelled", get drunk, ask God why i'm such a fuckup, and cry myself to sleep. Skip school on thursday, lay in bed all day crying and feeling like crap, mother is kind and makes a good supper as an "early birthday supper" because i felt bad and we had to work the next day. Worked friday, was better, still upset about me being stupid, everyone texting me "happy birthday" and facebook posts whatever. Saturday, do fuck all, clock strikes 6 pm, sad because i dont have a party, so parents take me out for supper. Nice. While we're at supper, my stomach starts hurting. Come home, go to the bathroom. A fucking slaughterhouse has opened up shop in my panties jesus christ. I look in the mirror and just say "oh."Summary:
Summarize: I know I can't be the only one looking for old country records. I'm mostly interested in Buck Owens and Merle Haggard, but most record stores only seem to have a small amount of 80s pop country or none at all. I went to a record fair a couple of months ago with 20+ vendors and only one had a small box of country. This stuff has to be out there, but I've been to record stores in Nashville even that were mostly rock-centric. I've got a fair bit of Bluegrass vinyl and strangely I've been able to find that stuff easier than 50s-60s Country. I know there's tons of this stuff on ebay, but it mostly seems to be coming from people who know nothing about records and grading and I've very hesitant about buying from these people.Summary:

Summarize: One Million Moms is a religious organization that hates gays. Every week or so, they send out a notice to their mailing list subscribers to notify them of companies that support gay and lesbian rights. In the email they provide a link to contact the heads of those companies and complain. I've found this mailing list to be a fantastic way of finding out which companies are supporting gay and lesbian rights, and being able to immediately voice my support to these companies directly through the convenient link provided by One Million Moms! Recently I've used their own website to write encouraging letters of support to Oreo, DC Comics, and JC Penney for their brave stance in support of gay rights. Their link pre-fills a subject line and email body with anti-gay hate speech and boycott threats, which you can easily delete and replace with your words of encouragement! Tell these great companies that you stand with them in their support of the LGBT community and use the One Million Moms' own resources against them!Summary:
Summarize: I'm sure you guys get this question a lot. I have been lurking for a long time, as well in /r/relationships and /r/deadbedrooms. I even dabbled in /r/askwomen. Lurking and reading links, tips etc has been somewhat helpful, but I am so at a loss! I need help. I have an almost non-existent libido. I so want to want to have sex. Sex fascinates me, I read about it, try and find visual stuimulation etc. It sometimes turns me on, but not as much as everyone else. I know why, let me explain it to you. I am a 20 something female, currently at a considerably low stress job with very little things in my life to worry about (I get paid decently, my rent is cheap, I have few bills, I take online classes in a field that I am very educated in (so while decently challenging, I enjoy the learning and feel very little pressure). Sorry if this seems like I'm bragging, I'm just saying I'm pretty much as non-stressed as a college student can be.) I eat healthy, I am at a normal weight, I am in a healthy relationship with a 20 something male (who I live with). Here's the two major problems: 1) I was raped as a teenager. I've read it goes either way with rape vctims, either they get very hyper sexual or get a very low libido. I got lucky enough to be very sensitive to sex. If one thing is done wrong I am turned off not for the night, not for the day but something, and often for the entire week. It's fucking bananas. If a partner touches me in such a way (through no god damn fault of their own, how could they possibly know my ridiculously long list of triggers, right?) that I dislike or find triggering/bring up bad memories I just don't want them to touch me at all. It becomes a desert down there. 2) I was diagnosed with depression as a teenager, I have been seeing a therapist for almost a year and am in the process of being rediagnosed. Right now, it is some sort of depressive disorder, but the main theory my therapist has is an anxiety disorder. Basically, my brain gets anxious/scared and so it decides to squash those negative and scared thoughts by "depressing" me to calm me down. So, awesomely enough, if something scares me I know, I know. I need professional help, and I promise you I am getting it! The problem is, while I have made leaps and bounds with my weird depression disorder and trauma, my sex drive has not changed. You may be thinking, could it be the boyfriend? It's not. It's always been like this with every partner I've had. I'm not prude by any stretch of the imagination (mostly me trying to figure out why the hell I just don't want sex), and no one I've been with I've particularly felt the amount of lust It seems all the other people I talk to/read about have. Sex is pretty much always the last thing on my mind. Before this week, it had been two months since I last masturbated. My boyfriend and I have sex about once a week, mostly because I feel it's unfair to him to trap him in a relationship without sex. I am very attracted to him, why don't I want to have sex with him or anyone else?? What the hell body?? Like I said, this week I have been trying to masturbate a lot more. Even though I don't really get the urge to masturbate, I still do because it seems to raise my libido a bit more than normal. So my question to you is how can I raise my libido more in a way that I will actually crave sex/get horny? I can;t even tell you the last time I got horny without a very long time of foreplay, uhg. Yes, I know some are going to tell me to talk to my therapist and trust me, I have. We have been working with it. Her main theory is hopefully to just continue focusing on depression/trauma and the libido will follow suit. Not quite yet the case. Possibly I need to be more patient? Is there anything else I can do? Sorry if this a confusing post, I'm nervous/a little tipsy because I needed to get up the courage to post this...Summary:

Summarize: Dear reddit, TIFU. So this happened like 30 minutes ago. Being the Canadian student I am I'm reliant on taking our metro system to get to school. Now if you've ever been on a Quebec metro you'll learn very quickly the drivers can be bigger cocksuckers than a raunchy adult movie. I'm talking saliva and phlegm everywhere. Anyways, I'm standing in the centre of the tram car with a few people in front of me when all of a sudden the brain dead SoB who was driving stopped suddenly. Now being the flash of the North I threw out my hand to grasp one of the poles in the middle but I estimated the wrong trajectory and well, Reddit, I grabbed a little 18 y-o Asian girls head and smashed it into the pole with my hand. I don't mean a tap, I mean fucking MMA fighter right hooking a 4 month old in the jaw. She hit the floor faster than a rock and I stood there looking like an asshole. Moral of the story: Don't try to Jackie Chan grab a pole off of a whim, you might end up knocking out a college chick.Summary:
Summarize: So luckily for you all, this fuck up happened on this day and doesn't involve sexy times with anyone. Just me being a general dumbass. So me and some friends decided to get some food before our next class we all had together at 1:15 so at about 12:45-ish we all piled into each other's cars and went to the nearest Taco Bell. I fucking love those cinnabon bites you can get there now... I think they're going to kill me one day but that's besides the point. I planned on sharing these nuggets of delicious, sugary goodness with my friends and they're only available in 2, 4, or 12, so basically a sample, a snack, or diabetes as your choices, but that's besides the point. Anyways, I'm getting a dozen to let my friends have some. We're inside Taco Bell, not the drive thru, because the car line looked rather long and it's fucking cold out so we all go inside. I go up first, my order is easy, just a 12 pack of cinnabon bites. This is where I fuck up. I look right at the lady and ask for a 12 pack (Taco Bell enthusiasts may know where this is going already) without missing a beat. I'm ready to get my little personal serving of 'Merica in a plastic cup and don't really think anything when the cashier asks me 'crunchy or soft?' Now I've ordered these bites in 12's before and really should've realized that was a weird question to ask for fried dough, but no, I'm a fucking retard and say, "wow didn't know you could do that... um, how bout soft?" so she rings me up, hands me the receipt and my card (important) and it says 12 fucking dollars on there. Um, they cost 4.50? So it's at this point I realize... oh shit, I just ordered one dozen soft tacos instead. Now this isn't a big deal, just take the tacos? But nah, I want my cinnabon bites and I'm determined to have my friends experience the foodgasm these will create upon touching our tongue. So as politely as I can (I work as a concessionist as my job so I try to be polite and not a hassle like some customers can be) I explain I've really screwed up on my order and it's my fault entirely. Could you give me a refund for this, I meant the cinnabon bites but didn't make that clear enough (because I'm a goddamn moron mind you). You'd think that'd be it but nope, it can't be that simple. This IS a fuck up after all, not just a minor mishap. So the cashier looks a bit befuddled and worried at once. She tells her manager, a shorter, stockier, younger woman complete with obviously fake colored hair and a massive attitude, she needs a refund. The manager looks like she's going to jump across the counter and fucking kill me. Now without looking directly at me, because that'd of course be way too rude and direct, she starts talking VERY loudly about how inconsiderate this is and how there's people waiting (I felt bad enough for keeping my friends and the assorted strangers waiting) but really was taken aback she was making this huge a deal out of this. A refund right? Well I paid with a card. And this manager doesn't know how to refund a card payment. And as far as I could tell only one of their registers was open so I'm holding up the whole line. (opening up another one isn't that easy, again concession experience) I feel so stupid now, but at the same time, I really couldn't help but wonder how you can earn the title of manager but not perform a card refund? My place of work, all managers and even some regular cashiers can perform refunds for customers. This manager had to call someone higher up, maybe customer service, shit I don't know, to tutorial her on how to do this refund. Meanwhile she's yelling to the back, do NOT make that dozen tacos, ay throw in a dozen cinnabons, while I'm standing off to the side letting other people get their orders out of the way. I feel like a really dumb shit, my friends think this whole ordeal is priceless, and I mean I'm not socially anxious, this is pretty funny, but I still felt bad for holding up the line. I overheard an older guy wondering why this woman couldn't just do the refund and made a public point of me being a detriment to the establishment or something but after quite a few more minutes, she rings up the refund, gets me some cinnabon bites and a reciept, all while looking super duper flustered. I don't think I've ever seen a human being so pissed off over dumbassery, it was just a mistake, allbeit a really stupid one. I felt a bit selfish for not just taking the tacos really but I work minimum wage and really didn't want to spend 12$ on food I didn't want and figured a refund would be a reasonable request. At the end of the ordeal, we were two minutes late for class (after intense reckless teenage driving) but I had the bites, the cinnamon sugar sprinkled food of the gods, and I was content.Summary:

Summarize: This was years ago. Met this guy on a probably now defunct dating site. He was younger than I typically would date but figured I'd just take a chance. First, he wanted to take me to a laundry mat to play the arcade game Ms. PacMan. I was ok with this and we split the bill. He kicked my ass in every game. He then suggested we go back to his apartment. Normally I would never do this on a first date but felt comfortable enough that he wasn't going to try and rape, rob or murder me. (don't worry - he didn't) So we made the short walk back to his place and he gave me a tour of his apartment. On his desk was a shit ton, and I do mean a ton, of loose dental floss (not in any package or casing). It was just piled on his desk in a huge mound. I jokingly said, "Wow. You sure do you like dental floss." To which he replied, "Why yes, I do. I think flossing is extremely important. Do you floss?" I do, but not on a regular basis. When I told him this he then lead me to his bathroom where he tried to give me a package of floss for me to keep. I declined the gift and said something about he clearly values it more than I do and I would hate to take it from him. He tells me that it's okay and he has lots more in his closet and never runs out. I still decline. So we head into the living room and I notice he brings with him the dental floss. We talk for a while and at some point started making out a bit. Which normally I don't do on a first date (seeing a pattern here?). We go back to talking for a bit and then he says, "Would you like me to teach you the proper way to floss?" as he picks up the package. "There is a right way to do it and most people are not doing it correctly." I declined his nice offer. I think he tried once more later in the evening as well. Then we played with this machine that calculates your BMI. He kicked my ass in that game too. That was more embarrassing to lose than Ms. PacMan though. The next day I get an email from him that states he thinks I'm fun, sexy, etc etc. And then, "However I am concerned about your lack of flossing and the importance of doing so. I hope you check out this website ... I would love to see you again. What are you doing this weekend?" Never replied back to that one. My runner up bad first date was this guy telling me how the last time he saw his brother that the brother repeatedly stabbed his dog (I have 3 dogs myself) and when he tried to drive his dying dog to the vet he realized the brother had also slashed the tires on his car.Summary:

While at the hotel, one of my cousins opened one of the dresser drawers for no apparent reason. She let out a gasp so my aunt and I went over to see why. In the drawer was a magazine. The centerfold was a naked black man with a giant penis. We started laughing hysterically. Grandma walked in the room and came over to see what all the commotion was about. We didn't stop her from looking. She glanced in the drawer, turned bright red, and let out a VERY surprised, "OH MY!" while covering her mouth. As if grandma seeing porn wasn't enough, my sister proceeded to read one of the stories in the magazine out loud to all of us, weird "sexy" voices and all. My grandma thought that was just great.

The important thing to keep in mind, IMHO, is that her experiences as a child, good or bad, comforting or painful, will forge her into the woman she will become. And I'm guessing, like most mixed race people I've known, she will grow to be an interesting and thoughtful human as the result of her experiences. Edit:Summary:
Summarize: Let's see... I bought Heroes III years ago but I lost the CD and I never had the awesome expansions. I had an urge to play again recently, and having simply pirated H3 in the past (haven't had the CD in years), I wanted to see if I could pirate it again. Well, I could. It's pretty easy, actually. I found the torrent but damn, it would take almost a whole day to finish downloading. I want to play now, damnit! I did some research and lo and behold, there exists a service for old, badass games! I think it was $5-15 for the complete edition, and I couldn't resist. I was playing within the hour and I stopped torrenting the game.Summary:

Summarize: Throwaway account for reasons. My girlfriend [26F] and I [28M] have been together for nearly 2 years now. She moved in to my house with me about six months ago. Things are great 90% of the time and we avoid a lot of the issues that tend to plague long term couples. We spend the majority of our free time together and really enjoy each other's company. But that 10% can completely derail things and it's becoming routine. There's one huge issue that keeps popping up on a nearly monthly basis: she'll find something about my behavior that she doesn't like then focus on it like a laser beam and use it as an excuse to have a huge argument, which results in multi-day animosity between the two of us. It's totally out of the blue every time. I never even remotely see it coming. When we first started dating she had legitimate points. I'm a young guy and haven't ever been much of a relationship person so I basically just did whatever I felt like doing at the time (just FYI, this did NOT involve flirting with other women or side flings). I vehemently stuck to the "be my own man" mentality for quite a while. This faded as our relationship went on and we became what felt like true partners instead of just two people dating. The monthly freakouts, however, did not let up. They became less about actual issues in our relationship and more about totally arbitrary things that haven't even occurred. She just suddenly picks out something that I did or said and uses it as a launching point to talk about how terrible our relationship is and what an obnoxious, embarrassing person I am. It's my fault every single time, even if nothing actually occurred. It's as if her criteria for me being a 'good boyfriend' suddenly changes in her mind for a few days. She's admitted to over-thinking things on more than one occasion but it's really getting to be a problem. A few examples: One time we watched a movie and she REALLY stretched to find parallels between the movie's toxic relationship and ours, which turned into her breaking down about the myriad of ways that our relationship could go badly in the future. Whenever I have a rough day at work and need to vent a little, she assumes that I'm exaggerating and my work problems are totally my fault. I have a family history of depression and handle it with medication, but when a bad episode kicked in and I became withdrawn she just told me I need to get better control of my emotions. I had a few beers with her parents (they offered) when we visited over Christmas and she completely flipped out when we got home because she thought I was trying to mentally escape with alcohol and how disgusted she was with my behavior. We nearly broke up over it. I wasn't drunk at any point and genuinely had no idea what she was talking about. She's been stressed out at work recently. When she got home, we cooked dinner together, took our dogs for a walk, then traded massages. By most accounts a solid evening. Then she told me this: "I make it too easy for you. I always have since we started dating. You should really have to work harder for it." 'It' referring to sex. It absolutely infuriated me that she suddenly decided that sex is some sort of currency I need to earn instead of two people who love each other enjoying their bodies and strengthening their bond. Naturally, we did not have sex. The thing that made this statement so unexpected to me is that she has a higher sex drive than I do so it's not like I'm constantly 'hounding her for poontang.' I truly do love her and fully intended on proposing later this year. We spend quite a bit of time talking about our future plans, kids, etc. and are on the same page for just about everything. We're very open with each other. I'm an admittedly sensitive person and some of the stuff she says bothers me more than it should. There's two sides to every story and I feel like I'm making her sound like a lunatic, and these random freakouts are only a tiny part of our time together. But they are genuinely so soul-crushingly frustrating that I'm questioning even continuing things with her. I no longer feel like I can enjoy the good times we have together because in the back of my mind I just KNOW she's going to flip out on me with no warning in the next month and there's nothing I can do about it. The arguments always end in the same way: I console her, tell her I'm trying my best, assure her that all relationships have rough spots, we say we love each other and want to stay together, then things gradually go back to normal over the next couple days. Frankly I'm getting sick of feeling like I'm the only person that needs to change to keep the relationship together. The next time it happens and she says she has doubts about our relationship over some arbitrary problem that hasn't even occurred, I might end up agreeing with her. I thought they were growing pains from a maturing relationship but I don't see them stopping any time in the future. Does anyone else have experience in a relationship like this? I have genuinely never seen her treat anyone else like she treats me in the outbursts. No matter who she has issues with, she tries to look at it objectively and always shoulders some of the blame. Other people don't see it when she gets super mad at me - they only see her how she is 90% of the time. I alone get her bad 10% - because of this I have no frame of reference so I can't really say how much I'm actually at fault. I really do want things between us to work out, but I can't handle this forever. If it doesn't lighten up in the future then I don't see her as someone I can spend the rest of my life with. I need a partner, not someone that will use any excuse to treat me like a verbal punching bag every time they get stressed out. A relationship isn't exactly healthy when one person is constantly blaming the other for everything. And before the obligatory "SHE'S ON HER PERIOD" response, the explosive arguments do not sync up with that.Summary:

Summarize: My first post on Reddit and it's about a penis...and my grandma. A few years ago my mom, sister, grandma, aunts, and cousins were having a girls' weekend shopping and going out to a bar. While at the hotel, one of my cousins opened one of the dresser drawers for no apparent reason. She let out a gasp so my aunt and I went over to see why. In the drawer was a magazine. The centerfold was a naked black man with a giant penis. We started laughing hysterically. Grandma walked in the room and came over to see what all the commotion was about. We didn't stop her from looking. She glanced in the drawer, turned bright red, and let out a VERY surprised, "OH MY!" while covering her mouth. As if grandma seeing porn wasn't enough, my sister proceeded to read one of the stories in the magazine out loud to all of us, weird "sexy" voices and all. My grandma thought that was just great. At least she has a sense of humor!Summary:
Summarize: I knew this kid back in middle school through high school. His first time masturbating was in the shower, he used shampoo as lube and it got in his eyes he slipped in the shower clinging to the shower curtain as he fell ripping it and the pole it was off breaking them and then banged his head on the tub. To top it all off his mom came in because of all the loud noises to find him covered in blood with sudsies in his eyes and his lubed up dick in his hand.Summary:
Summarize: This isn't something to worry about any more than the Flat Earth Society. It's a bunch of crazies just being crazy. Best thing to do is have a good laugh. For instance, their math is absurd - 10% of the population being male is far more than necessary to maintain functional breeding and genetic diversity under the conditions they are describing. Considering that a man can produce enough genetic material to impregnate easily 100 women per day (with proper application of modern medical technology), and that a sustained population would require each woman to produce only a single offspring over an assumed generational cycle of 25 years, then you would need: 25 years 365 days per year 100 women per day = 912 500 women per man. A ratio of about one-to-one-million would be sustainable. Suppose "to be safe" you want 10 times more men than that, it's still a population need of about 0.001% males. As for genetic diversity, this represents (with current population) about 35 000 men (for 3.5 billion women), which is more than enough to ensure adequate genetic diversity if the men are selected randomly.Summary:
Summarize: I'm sure you guys get this question a lot. I have been lurking for a long time, as well in /r/relationships and /r/deadbedrooms. I even dabbled in /r/askwomen. Lurking and reading links, tips etc has been somewhat helpful, but I am so at a loss! I need help. I have an almost non-existent libido. I so want to want to have sex. Sex fascinates me, I read about it, try and find visual stuimulation etc. It sometimes turns me on, but not as much as everyone else. I know why, let me explain it to you. I am a 20 something female, currently at a considerably low stress job with very little things in my life to worry about (I get paid decently, my rent is cheap, I have few bills, I take online classes in a field that I am very educated in (so while decently challenging, I enjoy the learning and feel very little pressure). Sorry if this seems like I'm bragging, I'm just saying I'm pretty much as non-stressed as a college student can be.) I eat healthy, I am at a normal weight, I am in a healthy relationship with a 20 something male (who I live with). Here's the two major problems: 1) I was raped as a teenager. I've read it goes either way with rape vctims, either they get very hyper sexual or get a very low libido. I got lucky enough to be very sensitive to sex. If one thing is done wrong I am turned off not for the night, not for the day but something, and often for the entire week. It's fucking bananas. If a partner touches me in such a way (through no god damn fault of their own, how could they possibly know my ridiculously long list of triggers, right?) that I dislike or find triggering/bring up bad memories I just don't want them to touch me at all. It becomes a desert down there. 2) I was diagnosed with depression as a teenager, I have been seeing a therapist for almost a year and am in the process of being rediagnosed. Right now, it is some sort of depressive disorder, but the main theory my therapist has is an anxiety disorder. Basically, my brain gets anxious/scared and so it decides to squash those negative and scared thoughts by "depressing" me to calm me down. So, awesomely enough, if something scares me I know, I know. I need professional help, and I promise you I am getting it! The problem is, while I have made leaps and bounds with my weird depression disorder and trauma, my sex drive has not changed. You may be thinking, could it be the boyfriend? It's not. It's always been like this with every partner I've had. I'm not prude by any stretch of the imagination (mostly me trying to figure out why the hell I just don't want sex), and no one I've been with I've particularly felt the amount of lust It seems all the other people I talk to/read about have. Sex is pretty much always the last thing on my mind. Before this week, it had been two months since I last masturbated. My boyfriend and I have sex about once a week, mostly because I feel it's unfair to him to trap him in a relationship without sex. I am very attracted to him, why don't I want to have sex with him or anyone else?? What the hell body?? Like I said, this week I have been trying to masturbate a lot more. Even though I don't really get the urge to masturbate, I still do because it seems to raise my libido a bit more than normal. So my question to you is how can I raise my libido more in a way that I will actually crave sex/get horny? I can;t even tell you the last time I got horny without a very long time of foreplay, uhg. Yes, I know some are going to tell me to talk to my therapist and trust me, I have. We have been working with it. Her main theory is hopefully to just continue focusing on depression/trauma and the libido will follow suit. Not quite yet the case. Possibly I need to be more patient? Is there anything else I can do? Sorry if this a confusing post, I'm nervous/a little tipsy because I needed to get up the courage to post this...Summary:

Summarize: Greetings internet, I got a message from someone on /r/learndota2 about Bristle after I commented on [this]( I decided to post the most useful bits of my advice for a couple of reasons. First, I may have got stuff wrong or missed things so having you guys check it out would be great. Second, Bristle has a ~49.45% winrate in normal skill and that needs to go up, he's really fun to play but no one wants to pick up a hero they're more likely to lose with than win. When I first picked up Bristle I was probably ~1.5k but this was before ranked was a thing. It takes almost no time at all to get to 2.5k with Bristle because people don't know what to do when you run at them. After that, people have lost enough games to Bristle to know when not to chase in a 5 man conga line hitting your back so he's slightly less effective. I usually play fairly passively until level 4 (1-2-1-0) and brown boots then if I'm vs a dual lane without something like fissure or hex I just jump on the squishiest hero, the carry if possible but not if they have an escape (e.g Anti-Mage or Slark). Most importantly, don't die , a Bristle that's fallen far behind is just a fairly tanky melee creep. As for being countered by the new items, just carry dust for glimmer/silver edgeand don't be afraid to build a BKB and/or MKB if people build halberd/solar. Starting: Easy Lane : Ring of Protection, Tangos, Salve and Mango if I think I'll be able to reach the side shop 54 seconds after the horn or after a couple of last hits, which is when I get Stout Shield then turn RoP into a Basi when possible. Use the extra regen and promise of burst mana to harass the enemy lane with quill sprays and a couple of right clicks if it's safe. At level 4 use the Mango to get full mana pool and go fight something that can't escape easily. 150 burst mana gives 4.2 quill sprays so try to use a few to get a couple of stacks up before committing, be efficient with your mango. You want to have full mana when you go in but try not to waste the burst, it's not cheap. Even if you don't get a kill, you force the enemy to go to base or use all their remaining regen. After you get a kill or zone someone, you have 30 secs to a minute to farm more safely, use that time well. Buy a TP scroll so you can help other lanes, though remember you'll have 75 less mana after using your TP and you're useless without mana at this point. Go for a ring of health if the support(s) are harassing you more than you can handle without regen from Mango/Tango or finish Treads if you're fine without. You'll want to go Stout -> Basi -> Boots of Speed -> TP scroll -> RoH/Treads -> Treads/RoH -> Vanguard in most easy lane games since you usually have the chance to get a quick Crimson Guard and snowball like crazy from there with your team, take a fight and/or tower every 70s because your entire team is basically unkillable for 10 seconds in fights before 25 mins. Difficult Lane : Ring of Protection, Tangos, Salve and Stout Shield. Go straight into Basi and a ring of health so you have the necessary health/mana regen and armor to secure farm in lane, then get a TP, then Treads so you can kill stuff if the opportunity arises. Depending on the timing of your Treads, how well other lanes are doing and the heroes in the game, you'll either want to complete your Vanguard into Crimson anyway, complete your Vanguard then go for something else like Solar Crest or skip Vanguard entirely and go for that Solar Crest sooner. Early Game: I personally like Crimson Guard as a first big item as it makes your entire team negate 30-70% of right-click damage in early fights, as well as the great health regen and armor that it gives you. Otherwise go for Solar Crest, it gives evasion and armor if you need to survive or amplifies your damage and provides miss chance vs an enemy that you want to kill quicker or hits hard (SF, Juggernaut and PA are commonly picked and great targets for Solar Crest). Remember to tread-switch when chasing people down at the end of fights or during pickoffs, you still don't have lots of mana/regen. Mid Game: If you went Crimson Guard first and the enemy team has right-click damage, go Solar Crest. If you went straight for Solar Crest, don't bother going back for Crimson, it's only really useful up to ~30 mins. I tend to either go for the AC -> Octarine build or AC -> Heart. Insert BKB after AC if absolutely needed but you generally want to absorb as much damage as possible for more quill procs. Go for Heart if you're going for a right-click build, it gives 40 base damage, massive amounts of raw hp and absurd regen outside of fights. Buy Octarine if you need more sustain in fights and/or your team has someone else with auto-attack damage to cover for you relying more on quills. Please don't go Blademail, Bristle's passive reduces the damage that you take and therefore reduces the damage that blademail does, you're literally countering yourself by levelling your own skills. Late Game: After AC and your big regen item, you can get anything you think will help, I played an 70 minute game ages ago where ended the game with 2 hearts, a skadi, a pipe, AC and travel boots so I could tank the entire enemy team and fountain to make space for my PA to go ham and kill everything. That's usually a pretty bad item build as you severely lack damage considering ~25k net worth but in that game it worked really well. In more normal games, generally go for either Shiva's, Abyssal, MKB, Scythe, Octarine/Heart, Skadi or Agh's. Shiva's is core if you have a Phoenix or immobile heroes on your team or you're playing vs heroes with low attack speed (e.g Tiny) or high move speed (e.g Luna, Enchantress). Abyssal is for if you need to cancel TPs vs rat heroes, you need to right-click harder vs tanky cores such as Sven, you need lockdown on a slippery hero like QoP or you need an instant disable against initiators (e.g Tidehunter). Only get MKB vs evasion that's actually hard to deal with. If the enemy PA is starting to snowball, don't hesitate to rush an MKB straight after AC, sometimes even before. If their dazzle bought a Solar Crest and is only using it on himself, don't bother, the evasion isn't damaging your team enough to warrant a 5k+ item when there are better alternatives. Scythe is really good, especially if you went Heart over Octarine since you'll likely be slightly lacking on mana regen. It gives a way to cancel TPs and lock down slippery heroes and lasts longer than abyssal, however it doesn't do much for your right-clicks so be aware that you might fall behind in that aspect. Buy Octarine/Heart if you think that you need both to survive. You'll have an absurd amount of EHP but very little damage, so make sure your mid and carry do plenty. Get a Skadi if you need more stats overall and spend a lot of time right-clicking. In most situations a Shiva's would be better but if you need to slow enemies and you're going for a more auto-attack oriented build, Skadi doesn't have cooldown and it gives slightly better offensive stats in return for significantly less armor and int. Aghanim's Scepter is good for dealing with many units so get it vs heroes like Meepo, Nature's Prophet and Spectre, otherwise buy something else, it's outshined by Skadi in terms of overall stats and both Scythe and Abyssal give better slow/stun on an important target. Once you have AC + Octa/Heart + 1, you can sell your Crimson Guard for the last 1500 gold of your next item if it's necessary. General stuff to know about the game: Always always always carry a Town Portal scroll until you get Boots of Travel, especially if you're playing against a hero that can towerdive early (e.g. night stalker, bristleback) and you have enough burst/disable to kill them or you have a spell that can save the ally if they go in: people rarely expect a tp response below 3.5k MMR. If you need to mute your team, do it. If someone's flaming or being an idiot don't let them distract you, they make it hard enough to win as it is. Practice last hitting in a lobby as your top 5 favourite heroes without buying any items or leveling skills (maybe psi blades on TA for bonus practice), once you can get ~50-70 in 10 mins you can probably outlane anyone below 3k MMR and be competitive above that. And as you continue towards 8 0 0 0 M A T C H M A K I N G P O I N T S, remember that [this]( applies more than you'd expect. Quite a bit of maths incoming to explain AC vs Heart so be warned! Anyways, here we go: I'm going to assume that Bristleback is at level 16 with strength treads, a basi, a Crimson Guard a Solar Crest. That means he has 1707 health, 18 armor, 25% evasion, hits for 98 damage per hit and attacks 0.98 times per second (used this . This comes to 4734 physical EHP vs auto-attacks from the front, 7890 physical EHP vs auto-attacks from behind and 96 damage per second. Spamming spells and constantly attacking over 7 seconds, have an average of 4 stacks of warpath. That changes your damage to 218 per hit and 214 per second. Now I'm going to show what happens if you add a Heart or an AC to that, since you should be finishing either one around level 15-18 if you're going for it after Crimson and Solar, depending on the game: With a heart, you have 2767 health and deal 258 damage per hit but the same attack speed, evasion and armor. That means you have 6751 EHP vs auto attacks from the front, 10330 EHP vs auto-attacks from behind and you deal 253 damage per second. With an AC, you have 33 armor and hit 1.27 times per second but the same health, evasion and damage per hit. That means you have 6782 EHP vs auto-attacks from the front, 11304 EHP vs auto-attacks from behind and you deal 277 damage per second. Also bear in mind that with a 'low health + high armor' build, flat heals restore more of your EHP (Omniknight's Purification heals for 13% of your health with the heart build, 21% with the AC build). This is doubly important for Bristle because if you go for Octarine Core, the heals from quill spray are flat, not percentage-based. AC also amplifies your team's damage per second and the damage you deal with quill spray and has an easier build-up and it weakens towers and Roshan. Wow, surprised myself there with some of that, AC is really good... The only real benefit to heart is that, since you have more health, you have more free quill sprays in teamfights but I don't like relying on the enemy team for my to deal damage. Also, Sange and Yasha is a potential item, get it after Crimson Guard and/or Solar Crest and before AC if you're going for it. The move/attack speed and maim are really useful since you don't have a positioning spell, and the bonus strength+agility give you a nice health, damage and attack speed boost. Go for it if you're not desperate for armor (i.e no one picked Slardar/TA or is rushing deso on enemy team) and you started relatively well. Here . Also, get BKB before AC once you get to high-skill, people start chaining stuns/silences pretty well and you'll likely need it sooner if you get it at all. Sorry for text wall, here's theSummary:

So one day we all gathered up our loose change and go to Checkers. We ended up going going to a Checkers located in the ghettos. Weve been to that ones of times and never gotten any shit. So we park, order our food and sit down and wait for our meal outside. There was a couple arguing not too far from us. We paid no attention to them. Our food was done and we start eating. The guy that was arguing with his girl came up to us and said "YO!". We stayed quite. "YALL GOT DRANKS?!". I look at him and say "...no". He immediately went to reach for something behind his back and at the same time all of us were about to get up and gtfo thinking we were gonna get shot. He actually pulled out a wad of money and said "I GOT YALL NIGGAAAAAAAAAS" and bought us fucking drinks.Summary:

Summarize: Ok Reddit, I'm an exchange student from Sweden this year in the U.S. And I really like it here except for a few things, and a major problem is my brother is a complete asshole. Now don't get me wrong, he's nice every now and then, but his personaloty really shines when he's around 1 or more friends with me. They always make fun of me, my country, and he says that I'm weird a lot too, thought not directly. Some examples: -you just radiate virginity -I hope I walk in to your room one day to see that you hanged yourself, so I can punch you in the balls and laugh. -Swedish people don't have any fucking common sense shit the fuck up Swed (this one is used a lot of the time by him and some of his friends) A lot of these are targeted towards how my communicative skills are lacking, I haven't really been socially active until this last year because of my self confidence have always been low. Some of it I because our countries and cultures are different which he demeans me for every chance he gets because he thinks he is always right. One thing that gets to me really bad is that he also gets mad whenever I ask him anything and then when he sees I'm mad he just makes some jokes and I laugh, and he thinks it's all cool, but I just about had it now. Now I don't have trouble with being with mine/his friends alone, I can make jokes with them and him but every now and then the delivery is off, or in most cases when we're in large groups, they will talk about stuff I have no fucking clue about so I can't really say anything and just look awkward. Keep in mind these people live in a small county so they have all lived with each other for about 15 years already which makes it kinda awkward for me. One thing makes it even worse, I can't get anywhere without him because way out of walking range from everyone else, and I can't drive while I'm here. On a positive note, all of my friends are his friends because that's how I met them at first. So I guess to sum it upSummary:
Summarize: I suppose I will ask here, since I planned on playing on Project1999. I played EQ for the first time yesterday. Made an Iksar Necromancer since those were good, but I couldn't find my way around the starting town, let alone find the necromancer guild master. I also had to get used to the controls and camera modes but decided to stick with the first person view since the other camera modes seem kinda weird. Anyway, having found no success with the Iksar town I made a human necromancer in Freeport. Another player messaged me and gave me some free stuff, but died while trying to handle the inventory (almost all my slots were full of scrolls and letters so I died while trying to rearrange my inventory to make space for the stuff). After that, I decided to find the necromancer guild master, Opal Blackbriar. Sadly I had no clues whatsoever, so I decided to hit the wiki which said the guild master is in a basement under the Inn. I went there but couldn't find the secret entrance and googling didn't give me any more information. Maybe you can give me a hint? Please? I'm also fairly intimidated by the scope of the game. I don't know anything really and I'm worried I can't keep up if I haven't played EQ back in the day. Maybe there's a guide for someone completely new to the game? I checked the "Getting started/returning" link on the right but that one mostly describes the classes and I feel the wiki can't help me that much if I'm not sure what I'm looking for. Any help would be really appreciated.Summary:

I was working at a big drugstore at the time and my boss took one look at me and put me the warehouse until I could get the "oh god, gonne die soon, gonna vomit sooner" look off my face. We'd just filled up a baler (the machine used to crush cardboard boxes, turning them into a a cube weighing several hundred pounds) so I had to wrap the bale and get it out. To do this you take thick wires and thread them through slots in the baler then tie them off in the back. As the cardboard tries to expand it puts a lot of tension into the line. Somehow my dumbass managed to cross the slots on not one by two of the wires so when the lift came up the cube became attached to the back of the baler. My manager and I tried to get the head back down to compress it again and let us untie it, but the preasure snapped the wires (we kind of expected this and had everyone well cleared). Suddenly a week's worth of cardboard exploaded out into the warehouse. We're talking a cascade that left about a quarter of the warehouse in cardboard up to your shin. My manager and I go way back, he just looks at me with this defeated look and says, "Go the fuck home."Summary:

And now I'm posting after wasting time replaying the prologue and then all the end cut scenes were completely black due to another bug. What a waste of time, Gearbox should expect some people to have played the beta and expect some people to not need a tutorial. If I wanted story I would have picked the prologue, and as much as I appreciate Gearbox's humor I wish I had that time back. Don't corner me with this unskippable bullshit. And the best part is those who actually liked the prologue could choose to do it, if they wished and I could have quit out and ignored it after trying it.Summary:
Summarize: I had an honest conversation with my serial cheater father (cheated on my mum with at least 5 women, probably much more) for the first time. He left her twice, though he's back with her now. I'm not sure where to take the relationship from here. Should I bother trying to have a relationship with him, considering that I only want to have a relationship with people who are respectful of me and care about me? To give more information, he was one of those dads who is always working and is rarely there, so we have never been close. The questions i asked him: “Would you have changed anything if you had known that I knew you were cheating on Mum when I was a teenager?” “I don't know that I would have.” “Did you think it would affect me?” “I didn't see how it would.” “What were you thinking, how did you think it woudl affect me?” “I didn't think about it.” “Did you think about how it would affect Mum?” “She didn't value me, so I saw it as being with someone who did value me.” (She often says things like “men are useless” and laughs at the music and TV shows he likes.) “How did you think I'd react when you left?” “I thought you'd be upset. But I didn't think too much about my feelings, I just thought I'd say it's my fault, my decision.” I don't know what to think about this. First of all...don't those answers seem...weird? How do you not think about this stuff? I feel somewhat upset about these answers, though he did apologize for having upset me what with all the cheating. I feel like he doesn't...I don't know, care? Does it seem like I'm being overly sensitive? I'm coming to reddit because, does this seem like the kind of father I should attempt to have a relationship with, or should I continue having an extremely distant and occasional contact with him?Summary:
Summarize: They're actually doing it to wedge between 2A absolutists and hunters. If hunters hear support for their gun usage, their response is "welp, I ain't affected, so fuck 'em," and when the prohibitionists gain hunter support, they split the NRA. It allows them to cast us as fringe. The us/them tactic is a well-used technique of politicians, especially Democrats. Ever notice that if you thought Bush was a Nazi and Condi was an Uncle Tom, dissent was the highest form of patriotism, but if you disagree with Obama's politics or you think Clinton is a horrible Sec'y of State then you're a racist or a misogynist? It's because Us/Them.Summary:
Summarize: I do not really get along with my sister, because she is the original scumbag Stacy. We couldn't live more opposite lives. But most recently her housing (Section 8) was in jeopardy of being taken away. Due to the fact that her boyfriend was living with her and the 3 kids. He is an ex-convict, does not have a job. Has a drug problem, no money, no car and what food stamps the government gives him goes to his parents. (Because they need them..yea right) Not the place where you eat 3 meals a day and the state only gives her enough for her and the 3 kids. Anyways. Housing, so she was going to get kicked off of housing if she didn't come up with 275$. She told the family that we needed to pay for it or she could be homeless. She has a job, gets child support, ssi for the kids. She had more than a month to come up with the money. Says she can't come up with it. So my Nmom decides to offer her 2 of the spare rooms in her house, pretty much giving them half of the house to themselves with the exception of no boyfriend and no dogs. Also my sister was to not have any company over. She would of been charged $500 a month and out of that $300 of would be put away for her in a savings account to help her get a place. Buttttttttt Noooo! "I can't live without my boyfriend, we want to be a family. I will have to make my kids live in the car and become homeless if you don't let my boyfriend stay with me." So she would rather become homeless and live in her car, instead of putting a roof over her kids head. Are you fucking dumb. Did you have a bowl of dumb for breakfast? I wish I could say that it stops there, but sadly it does not. 2 of her kids birthdays were this week, so I sent her a text last week saying I would like to wish the kids a Happy Birthday. No response, talked to her daughter at her fathers house. And guess what? She never had told the kids I wished them a happy Birthday.Summary:
Summarize: How the fuck are people upvoting this? Drivers are part of the OS and android is linux based. Why do servers use linux? Because it doesn't need to reboot for updates (like windows). In addition, do you have problems if you take your trusty usb sticks and put them in your pc? It's the same thing, if you buy cheap shit off ebay you're going to have components that fail but surely the important ones will get to be implemented in their android (don't look at me like that, every single phone company has its own modified version of android, it's not a big deal to get the drivers in there). I'll give you that it's not going to be like arranging magnets on a fridge as a battery needs different connectors than a camera, but you don't need more pins between a 2mp camera and a 10 mp camera, especially not if you just upgrade the size of the lens. This would definitely work with some clever engineering. CPU's don't get smaller or larger, you will have a spot for the cpu. Doesn't matter if it's single or eight-core. Same goes for RAM. Then you'll have the battery in a place where you can extend it at the sacrifice of some other components and the rest will just be standard i/o.Summary:

Summarize: I was paid $100 by a bipolar mother to clean her severely mentally ill son's room and clean the viruses from his computer. This kid was messed up, like, when finished eating a bowl of cereal he would just drop it on the floor. Milk and all. We put on gloves and threw away all of his shit, ignoring his protest. I stumbled upon a folder labelled "homework", which was a red flag as he had dropped out of high school. More forboding, the folder was about 115 GB, taking up 70% of his HDD. Upon opening it my jaw just dropped. It was nothing but CP. Not modeling pictures, but vile shit with titles like "6 year old whore Nancy brutally gangraped by daddy.avi". As I scrolled down, it was clear that this mentally ill teen was in possession of most of the child pornography traded in America. In a subfolder, there was txt files describing diary entries of how he molested his niece when she was 4, and brutally sadistic fantasies that I am nauseated even thinking about. I wanted to just call the police. He would be tried as an adult and beaten and sexually abused for the rest of his life in a federal pen. I ended up telling his mother what I found, and if she did not send him away and deal with his sexual sadism, and APD + other severe mental issues, I would. I took a screenshot and scrubbed his PC. He became agitated and screamed and cried like a toddler when he was able to get onto his PC when I was done. I've never told anyone this, but that night, we caught him masturbating over my (very buff) friend's cot. We beat him, beat him senseless. I had never been on the giving end of such a brutal beating before but it felt good, good that this monster was feeling even a fraction of what he fantasized about doing to little girls and boys. When he stopped begging for his life (he had urinated on himself and was barely conscious), I went downstairs while my friend (whose daughter was molested) continued kicking and borderline torturing the guy. I told his mother what happened. She apologized, said she was sending him off in the morning, and paid us $140 each. She cried, but she didn't seem upset that we hurt her son. Like she knew what a monster he was and wished we had put him down.Summary:
Summarize: He's a troll. Look through the full two days of comments he's made and it is crystal clear. Hell, just look at his name. And should he actually be from Texas, which I doubt, then I apologize on behalf of the rest of Texas. It is clear someone moved a rock somewhere and this slithered out. Your average Texan does not hold such ridiculously ignorant views. We are generally a progressive, accepting people. The problem comes from the fact that those progressive, accepting people don't go around shouting their views or trying to force their views on others. We are typically live and let live. But those that hold toxic views feel the need to spread those toxins. They do so in the most obnoxious and disputable ways and that unfortunately leaves the rests of us looking bad, too. Now, do we have assholes? Of course! Texas is 268,500 square miles or 695,621 square kilometers and we border four states. Assholes are bound to happen.Summary:
Summarize: When I was five I had a severe head injury from geting hit by a truck while I was riding a moped. I had, what you have, a subdural hematoma and some other injuries. I died for two minutes in life flight helicopter before they brought me back on the 13th go with the defibrillators. I had a 10% chance to live through a surgery to relieve the pressure the blood was putting on my brain. The pre surgery cat scans showed my body had absorbed an amazing amount of the blood over night and they didn't have to do surgery. I was out of the hospital in two weeks.Summary:
Summarize: Today, there are a lot of Atheist racists in the south that hate Christians as much as they hate Jews and Blacks. They have a big problem with that "God will deliver us" bullshit and decided that they must seize what they can for the White Race before it is destroyed because God sure won't help. Many of these people are highly educated. My first experience with some of these groups was when I was visiting college friends down south. The leaders of these groups were actually people who went to the same caliber of schools as I did (the best). It was very surprising and it is something that has stuck with me. Their message is actually much more resonant because they lack that cognitive dissonance that many other racist groups have. They'll love this, I promise you that.Summary:
Summarize: My blonde five-year-old daughter (husband's stepdaughter) has recently had a huge growth spurt. We bought her new clothes, including new underwear. As I was folding laundry today I said, "we need to start phasing out these smaller underwear." My husband replied, "we could probably sell it to old men in Japan." When I told him his joke wasn't funny, he said remarks like, "I didn't say we'd send a picture or anything." I was extremely disgusted and angry. I told him that I love him, but would appreciate if he gets a hotel room for tonight. He apologized and refuses to leave. Should I just chalk it up to a thoughtless joke, or is it okay that I am so angry I want him to leave for tonight? *Summary:

Summarize: I'm actually curious what would happen if AMD just went bankrupt before the end of the year. I don't actually think it's that bad, but it's in the realm of possibility at this point, but what would actually happen ? -Sony is planning to use AMD for PS4, what happens to this project if AMD can't deliver on the hardware ? -XBOX looks likely to use AMD for durango/720, is microsoft still going to stick with them given the extreme uncertainty for the company ? -Intel and AMD got out of court not too long ago. If AMD goes under, and intel takes a monopoly on the x86 market, will INTEL be looking at a pile of trouble with the SEC for uncompetitive practices, or have they already paid their dues by settling 1b$ with amd ? The reason I'm asking this is for a bit of a strange hypothesis. I think AMD is going under, and I think there is a concerted attempt to save it. AMD going under would cause such problems in the x86 and video card markets it would be a disaster. AMD holds a number of patents on all kinds of technology that Intel and other companies use on a regular basis, the IP license agreements between intel and AMD are a ridiculous mess that has only recently been sorted out. Intel obviously has an interest in dominating AMD, espescially in a shrinking market. But I think if it actually tanks, with intel just coming off an anti-trust/IP suit between AMD and intel, it spells more anti-trust problems for intel that intel just can't afford to deal with right now. Sony, Nintendo and I think likely Microsoft now have a significant multibillion dollar interest in the survival of AMD. JP Morgan recently met with the AMD board to offer guidance, which isn't a huge deal in itself. 17 hedge funds picked up AMD in Q4 2012, why ? The stock is junk. Every fundamental that exists screams to stay the hell away from the stock, why get involved ? Do they see something, are they trying to accomplish something ? Why are guys like Oppenheimer, Vanguard and Fidelity, Citadel and First Eagle suddenly picking up a stock that is about to take a nosedive into the dirt ? Is this just a drunken roulette gamble for billionaires or do they actually know what they're doing ? Why did SeaMicro go to AMD when intel could have much more easily acquired the company ? SeaMicro pretty much exclusively dealt with Intel for everything and was a good relationship for both, and ironically, they still use intel chips. So why does AMD now own it ? Did intel just not care, or are they throwing AMD a bone to keep SEC off its back ? Huge speculation, borderline tinfoil hat (because I've been bored lately), these are not reasons to invest in the stock. There could be any number of reasons to explain all of the above, and I'm sure other more well informed people know what is actually going on. I admit I kind of want AMD to stick in the game, but it's in big trouble without some kind of significant help.Summary:
Summarize: Interesting. I've also heard that vibrators were used in the Victorian Era on women by doctors if you can believe it, to treat a condition they called "Female Hysteria." Only women suffered from this condition, and was attributed to a variety of ailments. Anything from insomnia to sexual desire could be diagnosed as Hysteria. Yes, women being horny was considered an "ailment" that needed to be treated with vibrators. It was strictly considered a medical procedure for a doctor to do this, it was not thought of as sexual. Many doctors also thought it was too much hard work and time consuming to perform this treatment. Info on the history vibrators: Info on female hysteria:Summary:
Summarize: I want to call attention to this, utterly dark reason why I DREAD people right up until Gold who lock in as support. and yes I did just lose for one again. The worst type of support player, the type I see up until Gold every time then vanishes (thank fuck) is the type who picks it not to win, not because they like the champion, not because they trust their ability to carry or even be carried. It's because they realised they can't carry, pick a role at low ELO that they know nobody expects them to carry from, and proceed to instantly flame the moment something goes wrong because they know - they KNOW - they're probably losing anyway. The support by default, because then they won't be challenged (mostly) on their flaming opinions as the REAL cause for the loss. This Blitzcrank literally intentionally fed because of our Graves though, so slightly different. This type of player arises because of three misconceptions about the role at lower ELO: The Support is expected to be just that, a support, and thus is not expected to be the team's carrier. The Support is not, at lower ELO's, seen as the deciding factor in lane. Actual support mains fly out quickly because of this. The Support's deaths do not matter. Seriously. Those of you in low ELO know this, those in high ELO may have forgotten this but below Gold people believe it is OK to die as support . Seriously. You realise you mke the trade 1-1 or leave your adc 1v2, and are STILL WORTH GOLD RIGHT? The support ends up being the default role fro two types of people (excluding last pick). Either the guy expecting to be carried by his duo, or the guy who wants to be in the prime position to blame his team. After all, the support can never be the reason for the win, so how can he be the reason for the loss? This is an attitude in lower ELOs I continuously see. I''m on my third time up to Gold because I can never get motivated to jump a tier unless there's a time frame or an extenuating circumstance but really, now that supports can have high gold incomes, these poeple stick out like a sore thumb. It's not often referred to in the troll videos I see, but it's seriously common. The support is a great role. It CAN carry, it fits a specific niche of play style and if you're going to undertake the role, respect it . It can hold so much power is played right.Summary:

Summarize: Wow so I typed all this out and then reddit was like herp derp let's delete it instead. So when I was 7, my family relocated from Florida to Texas. I was young so obviously I was getting underfoot a lot when my parents were trying to unpack and get shit situated. They sent me to my room to play with my barbies so I wouldn't get in the way. So it's cool, I'm playing with my barbies minding my own business when all of a sudden I get this strange feeling like I'm being watched. I'm sitting near the bed and the doors to my bedroom are on the opposite corner. My room is situated kind of like [this (pro paint skills, I know).]( I look up and between me and the doors, I see this little girl, I'd estimate was probably around 7-9 years old, in full pioneer attire. She looks pissed, sad, and confused at the same time. I scream my head off bloody murder and my parents come running as she disappears. As I recount my story to my parents, they tell me it's all nonsense and due to my "overactive imagination." This goes on for four years. My parents say it's nothing, it's not real, and hang a painting of Jesus over my bed like that's supposed to help or make me feel better. Even as a kid I didn't believe in God so that also didn't help my perspective. I only saw her a handful of times but more often than not when I was sleeping, or even worse, when I was showering (since the bathroom was just off my bedroom) I would feel this creepy sensation of someone watching me. We moved back to Florida when I was about 11, and for years I KNEW what the truth was but my parents vehemently denied it. Finally I was about 17 or 18 in the car with my mom and mentioned it, saying I knew the rest of the family thought I was full of shit but I know for a fact she was there. My mom went real silent for a minute and then told me that she never came clean with me as a child since she knew that it wouldn't help me deal with it any better, and she didn't have any way of explaining it, but she had seen her too and knew she was real. One particularly momentous occasion, she walked in my room to check on me at night and I was already asleep. Between me and her was this little girl, and my mom gasped. The ghost turned around and looked at my mom and my mom said "Go away!" The little girl pouted and said "NO! YOU go away!" and then vanished. My brother and I also were homeschooled for a few years and I did my work in the kitchen. My brother, being older, did his work in his bedroom. He told me years later that he would hear soft sobbing of a small child coming from my room, when he knew I wasn't in there. If he opened the door to go in my room, the sound would stop. The sad thing is I wish I was making this up or hallucinating this. To this day about once or twice a year I have violent nightmares about returning to this house and having her exact her revenge on me or something. One of my greatest fears in life is returning to that house. Good thing it's half the country away.Summary:
Summarize: So luckily for you all, this fuck up happened on this day and doesn't involve sexy times with anyone. Just me being a general dumbass. So me and some friends decided to get some food before our next class we all had together at 1:15 so at about 12:45-ish we all piled into each other's cars and went to the nearest Taco Bell. I fucking love those cinnabon bites you can get there now... I think they're going to kill me one day but that's besides the point. I planned on sharing these nuggets of delicious, sugary goodness with my friends and they're only available in 2, 4, or 12, so basically a sample, a snack, or diabetes as your choices, but that's besides the point. Anyways, I'm getting a dozen to let my friends have some. We're inside Taco Bell, not the drive thru, because the car line looked rather long and it's fucking cold out so we all go inside. I go up first, my order is easy, just a 12 pack of cinnabon bites. This is where I fuck up. I look right at the lady and ask for a 12 pack (Taco Bell enthusiasts may know where this is going already) without missing a beat. I'm ready to get my little personal serving of 'Merica in a plastic cup and don't really think anything when the cashier asks me 'crunchy or soft?' Now I've ordered these bites in 12's before and really should've realized that was a weird question to ask for fried dough, but no, I'm a fucking retard and say, "wow didn't know you could do that... um, how bout soft?" so she rings me up, hands me the receipt and my card (important) and it says 12 fucking dollars on there. Um, they cost 4.50? So it's at this point I realize... oh shit, I just ordered one dozen soft tacos instead. Now this isn't a big deal, just take the tacos? But nah, I want my cinnabon bites and I'm determined to have my friends experience the foodgasm these will create upon touching our tongue. So as politely as I can (I work as a concessionist as my job so I try to be polite and not a hassle like some customers can be) I explain I've really screwed up on my order and it's my fault entirely. Could you give me a refund for this, I meant the cinnabon bites but didn't make that clear enough (because I'm a goddamn moron mind you). You'd think that'd be it but nope, it can't be that simple. This IS a fuck up after all, not just a minor mishap. So the cashier looks a bit befuddled and worried at once. She tells her manager, a shorter, stockier, younger woman complete with obviously fake colored hair and a massive attitude, she needs a refund. The manager looks like she's going to jump across the counter and fucking kill me. Now without looking directly at me, because that'd of course be way too rude and direct, she starts talking VERY loudly about how inconsiderate this is and how there's people waiting (I felt bad enough for keeping my friends and the assorted strangers waiting) but really was taken aback she was making this huge a deal out of this. A refund right? Well I paid with a card. And this manager doesn't know how to refund a card payment. And as far as I could tell only one of their registers was open so I'm holding up the whole line. (opening up another one isn't that easy, again concession experience) I feel so stupid now, but at the same time, I really couldn't help but wonder how you can earn the title of manager but not perform a card refund? My place of work, all managers and even some regular cashiers can perform refunds for customers. This manager had to call someone higher up, maybe customer service, shit I don't know, to tutorial her on how to do this refund. Meanwhile she's yelling to the back, do NOT make that dozen tacos, ay throw in a dozen cinnabons, while I'm standing off to the side letting other people get their orders out of the way. I feel like a really dumb shit, my friends think this whole ordeal is priceless, and I mean I'm not socially anxious, this is pretty funny, but I still felt bad for holding up the line. I overheard an older guy wondering why this woman couldn't just do the refund and made a public point of me being a detriment to the establishment or something but after quite a few more minutes, she rings up the refund, gets me some cinnabon bites and a reciept, all while looking super duper flustered. I don't think I've ever seen a human being so pissed off over dumbassery, it was just a mistake, allbeit a really stupid one. I felt a bit selfish for not just taking the tacos really but I work minimum wage and really didn't want to spend 12$ on food I didn't want and figured a refund would be a reasonable request. At the end of the ordeal, we were two minutes late for class (after intense reckless teenage driving) but I had the bites, the cinnamon sugar sprinkled food of the gods, and I was content.Summary:
Summarize: Been seeing this guy for more than a year already. Met his friends, family, everyone. Stayed in his house for weeks, nothing. Checked for warning signs for cheating, found none. I recently found out he's been seeing his main girl all the time we were together. Should I tell his main girl? She's 100% clueless about me. I can't let this guy get away with it.Summary:
Summarize: She talked to me a few months ago and I told her I was newly atheist when she asked if I believed in god. Today she approached me while I was eating lunch, with her friend by her side. She told me she had been worried about me and wanted to talk to me about jesus, so we talked for about ten minutes and then her friend (who hadn't said anything or even looked at me until this point) started to take over. He debated me for an hour and constantly brought up that strange "what are the chances that we even exist? there must be god" argument and I kept saying that the chances were RIDICULOUSLY HIGH. During this whole ordeal, the girl grew this look on her face like she wanted to cry. She thought I was going to hell and there was nothing she could do about it. She thought that I was denying the only true happiness in the world and she had failed to save me. I asked her if she was ok, and she could barely say no, I could hear the tears in her throat. I haven't told my parents that I am atheist for the same reason. I want her to be ok, I mean, she is seriously pretty. She cared about me enough to do something that obviously SCARED THE SHIT out of her, because it took her months, and I had to give her an experience that made her almost cry. What do you guys have to say about this? I feel like an asshole.Summary:

Summarize: Hey r/Newcastle! I'm studying at the University of Queensland this coming semester, and I am looking for relatively easy/cheap ways to travel around to various cities other than Brisbane, and I believe New Castle would be a pretty interesting place to travel to. However, I don't know much about your city, and I was wondering what you believe would be an outstanding reason to visit your city from Brisbane? Also, is it possible to take a bus/train or is it easier to take a plane?Summary:
Summarize: You understood what I said, but the difference is in our approaches to what it means to be racist. Largely we are taught that a racist person is inherently a bad person. The assumption behind that is that there are very few racists and the rest of us are not racist. Understanding how racism works, that is not the case. Racism isn't about "hate" or even disadvantage; racism is about privilege. The central tenet of racism is that certain people are "normal," "natural," and capable of individuality. So, in Western culture, white is seen as being normal while all others are seen as somehow abnormal. The important part of this is that everyone raised in our culture is taught to think this (including people who aren't white). As a result, everyone is heavily influenced by this racism. If everyone is influenced by this racism, then pointing out or shaming a specific racist is a case of the pot calling the kettle black. We are all racist. So, me pointing out the racism in your desire isn't me saying you are a bad person (I'd guess that you are far from it since you seem to be asking an actual question about something that could feel like a vicious accusation). However, we are responsible for the things we take part in, even when it's not our fault. So I would say yes, you are responsible for how you affect other people even if you are only a link in a chain you didn't start.Summary:

Summarize: So last time at work in Japanese Gap I saw Norman Reedus. Today I was handling the cash wrap duties when a guy walks up with a whole bunch of shit and tells me to wait a minute because his girlfriend has a lot of stuff too. I ring him up and wait for his girlfriend since the line wasn't too bad. See his girlfriend come with a whole bunch of cashmere sweaters, "damn she's tall as fuck I tell myself" then I catch her face a little and thought she looked a little like Karlie Kloss from Victoria's Secret and a whole bunch of fashion mags and spreads I read, ring up all her stuff and she gives me her credit card to pay. Took a peek at the name sure enough it was Karlie Kloss! I sheepishly give her back her card and asked her if she was the victoria secret model, she said she was and asked if I watched the fashion show, and I said I couldn't because I had a lot of finals to study for. We talked a little about my school and what I studied and at the end she and her boyfriend said good luck to me on my finals :)Summary:
Summarize: Hi there! I'm going to be applying to the JET program so I can become a Assistant language teacher in Japan. I need a reference letter from a professor, preferably in my faculty (MBB). I only know one professor on a personal level and that's because I did a NSERC with him, however things did not go well during my summer working for him. I made a few mistakes, to the point he had to have a private talk with me. The graduate students were very aggressive towards the undergrads (swearing, ignoring, talking behind their backs, a lots of drama) to the point one of the other undergrads broke down and cried and the professor did nothing for support. It was a hostile work place, absolutely awful. The experience made me regret my entire degree, I don't think I can work in a research lab again. The three other undergrads share the same feelings. I contacted this professor to talk to him, so I can ask him for a reference anyways. it was worth a shot. However, I missed my meeting with him by getting stuck in gridlock traffic with no phone because of a massive accident on highway 1 in north vancouver. I was 20 minutes late and he wasn't available anymore. Everything that could have gone, did go wrong. he said I can see him on Monday instead. We are not on the best terms, I don't think he likes me and I fucked up again. Not sure if he will give me reference. So how do I go about getting a reference from another professor? do I have to visit their office hours every single week? any tips? I desperately need a reference by November 29th and I have 5 courses next semester.Summary:

Summarize: A buddy of mine call him Kevin is in a very sticky situation and he has no idea the legal grounds to money he is entitled to. My buddies dad is very old and has many kids from different wives. So my buddy has many half siblings. They all used to get along well and there were no issues growing up. One of Kevin's oldest half sisters Jackie, passed away with cancer when he was 16. She didn't have kids so she left each member of their family some money. For Kevin she left ~50k so that he would not have to pay for school and it was meant for him. Since he was younger than 19, his oldest sibling their half sister Martha was given all the money to hold. In order to receive student loans and grants, the money was to be held and just monthly student loan payments were to be made. This would ensure the loan organization not cutting up funding for grants due to having a large amount of money. Now Kevin is older than 21 and is done school and is now working. His father got older and has been bed ridden, taking care of him and hiring a full time caregiver has divided the family as no family wants to put the time effort or money to help. Since Kevin still lives with his dad he has to help out at home and his mom works as well. Kevin no longer speaks to any of his half siblings to keep away from the drama. Now Kevin has asked Martha to give him the money he is entitled to as he is of age and wants to pay off student loans and apply to a master's program. Martha has refused saying the money was on a condition kevins mom wasn't working and the fact that Kevin seperated himself from the family and she needs to help the other siblings who are all older and have families. Only a lawyer was given the will of Jackie and that money was to be distributed as per the will by Martha. Kevin has never seen the will or has no idea if Martha was initially being kind and paying for his tuition herself using Jackie's will as a way to give the money or if it was actually part of the will. How can my buddy best go about requesting either a copy of the will from the lawyer/finding his portion of the money. And ultimately how does he get what he was entitled to?Summary:
Summarize: Hi guys, So yesterday....randomly a very close childhood friend of mine said some pretty fucking hurtful things to me. Let's call him Jeff. Jeff basically questioned my integrity/character (saying that he thinks I'm shady and I'll backstab people) and took things out of context. Sorry in advance...this is a very long post and a lot of it is stream of consciousness. To give you a bit of background on this Jeff, hes a very emotional person. a lot of times he just rages at all our friends when we play games and makes it personal. In fact, everything he said to me started over a game of counter-strike. Jeff likes to "make mental notes of things to leverage later (thats literally what he said)." He's very analytical on like every detail in life. very petty things that don't matter and he blows it out of proportion. Some of the examples Jeff used were over 5-10 years ago and really childish. Here are some of his reasons for calling me a backstabber. He brought up how I gave him my MMO (fucking maplestory) account to use and he leveled the character. When I wanted to play again he said I was shady for using the character to play again, since the account was now his because I gave it to him (he had a new account and didn't even use mine anymore). I ended up trading the account for a new character to give to him and made a new one myself. Sorry, this example is a little embarrassing to even type out. Jeff says that I objectify women. He basically implied that it wasn't cool that I had FWBs. That I'm using women as a tool "only for sex," even though the times I do have these sort of relationships, it's understood that it's purely physical and I make my intentions very clear from the beginning. When I share some of my experiences, Jeff says he thinks I am completely bullshitting and only trying to inflate my own ego. He says he doesn't believe some of the fulltime offers I refused due to location because I don't have "proof." His reasoning behind is that when we were growing up (maybe middle school years) I would bullshit a lot. He holds this against me and says that he "cannot take anything I say at face value" because of it. Like, instead of supporting me or helping me with a decision when I choose to share it with him/my group of friends, he'll basically think to himself and want proof for it (pics or it didn't happen). Even going as far as asking my ex-girlfriend's ex-boyfriend (a highschool friend) if I was lying about losing my virginity to her. Isn't that beyond fucked up? Funny thing is that Jeff said that the ex told him (how would he even know?) that I was lying and I never did (my ex likes to keep her sex life to herself). He says I am inconsiderate about other people's feelings because of how much of a troll I am in person/public. I'll admit I am pretty obnoxious sometimes but in all honesty it is just fun and games, and for the most part people enjoy the vibe. For example..I was jokingly giving this waiter some shit for jumbling a word. she said , "oh let me swope your credit card" and I chuckled and said, "oh yeah just swope it real quick." He thinks that I'm not considering the feelings of the people around me by creating an awkward situation? Don't know. There were more examples he brought up with similar situations. There's so, so, so much more that he said and accused me of , but I hope I got the message clear. I just kind of took all of it when he was saying it to me. I tried explaining myself for certain things and told him that he was misinterpreting things, but he wasn't having it. So I told him that I appreciate the honesty and that was it. I honestly don't know how to feel about this. I understand that he's an emotional guy and I've kind of accepted that he goes overboard a lot of times (not just to me). But I think he went too far. Is there a right thing to do here? I'm feeling very heavy hearted. Once again apologies for the long post and I appreciate anyone who takes the time to read. Thank you.Summary:

Summarize: I can't meet her parents because of my lack of spirituality. In fact, she hasn't told them about me for fear of what they'll do, but they're not stupid so they have to know that she's dating someone. What really sucks is that our relationship is fantastic otherwise; she's far and away the best girl I've ever dated and this is our only major roadblock. Every time I bring it up she tells me that she "needs more time" to soften them up, but so far the best she's gotten is that they'll only acknowledge a relationship with a non-Muslim if it leads to marriage (which, of course, it can't if I can't meet or even reveal myself to them). I've met her sister and cousins who are all very accepting, but to me it's impossible to really progress a relationship to its fullest stages if you can't be a part of the other person's immediate family too. I just don't want to put my girlfriend in a situation where at some point she'll have to choose between me or her family. Has anyone else ever been in a similar situation? How did it turn out?Summary:
Summarize: Look, the way I see it, the government shouldn't make it easy or hard for anyone to make money. The occupiers and I have this in common. Where we differ is that I don't believe that there's a big corruption conspiracy that makes it easier for the rich to stay richer. Sure, if you're born to a rich family you have a huge leg up, but family money doesn't last forever, and eventually you'll get a granddaughter like that kardashian bitch who'll spend it all and then bam. Even field. I just want the occupiers to focus less on "give us their money" and more on "don't take money from anyone" which is the only way to have true equality in this country.Summary:

Summarize: About a year after I joined the military I was doing some training at blackwater and thought I was cooler than I was. I grew up not far from where I was stationed and often went home for the weekend and threw hotel parties. So a girl asks me to escort her to her senior prom (I'm only a year older than her) and I accept and offer to throw a party. So while I'm getting ready, my tux mostly on me and a friend get to practicing disarming techniques we'd learned on each other. Well... He was holding a knife (because we're idiots) and I performed the move in a manner more effective than I was ever taught. The knife flew back and shot into his mouth, sliced open his lip, gums and chipped a tooth. Then the knife fell out of his mouth and landed less than an inch from his foot. The blood started flowing pretty quick and all I could do was apologize and offer well wishes cos I was in my tux and couldn't get blood on it... It was only a rental. I have no idea why he didn't punch me. Instead he just drank a fifth Hennessey and passed out - like a boss.Summary:
Summarize: Okay boys lets get this shit started, yesterday I was at a party, with some friends. To our group of friends / aqauaintances belong three girls. One of these girls is in a relationship with a good friend of mine, the other isnt important for this story and THE OTHER is the one I am / was interested in. So we were getting pretty drunk and she started talking to me. Although I ain't the MOST experienced guy, you could tell... there were some hints (talking about sex, other guys, girls.. you name it). For the rest of the evening we were running around together, drinking from one cup, her two best friends telling me (if in a joking way or not I CANT TELL SINCE I WAS FUCKED UP) to make a move, while she heard it and laughed in a positive way. All these events led to me taking her aside after 2 hours or so and asking her whether she has a boyfriend (now this is interesting): she said that INDEED she does have one, but instead of shaking me off, she kept bugging me, kept asking me WHY I asked her this. I basically kept replying "you know exactely why im asking" and she kept saying "no i really dont", I would then go with "its quite obvious isnt it"... she: "no i dont understand". After that I regrouped with my friends and she with hers to talk about this shit and share my defeat. Having talked to them I still decided not to face the defeat and make one LAST TRY. Went to her best friend (which I have a relativly good relationship with) and asked her if what she was talking concerning her boyfriend is actually true. Her friend didnt really confirm it, its basically 50% of a relationship over a long distance, but she doesnt know much more. So I really dont want to piss you guys off with this wall of text, but the last part is inbound: With this knowledge I proceeded to re-open a conversation with the girl I was intersted in and I basically admitted outright that I am interested, but at the point at which she asked if the interest is momentary and just for the evening OR has a deeper root her stupid other friend intervened and I couldnt answer. After that I didnt get another chance to isolate her in order to clear things out and its pissing me off because ... i dont know... I dont get why she just didnt tell me that she has a boyfriend and keep it that way OR tell me that shes single allowing me to kiss her with a clear consciense. EDIT: Just remembered that there was another situation I initially forgot about: just before we left she was talking to 5-6 younger guys (idk about what, thats not the point) and they were CLEARLY hitting on her.. well anyway fast forward when we were just leaving she said to me: " why didnt you save me from them haha?" . ... just thought this might be important for the entire story, to put things in place. Tonight we are going out alltogether again. HOW SHOULD I PROCEED? WOULD IT BE DESPERATE TO CONTIUNE MY MOVE, OR DOES IT NOT MATTER SINCE I ALREADY REVEALED MY INTENTIONS? THE END. Cheers if you read all this shit ;)Summary:
Summarize: I'm a rather new Redditor and this is not my main account but I need to get some things off my chest, process it all, and maybe get some advice. If this is the incorrect sub I apologise and please tell me where else I can go. I'm a nineteen year old girl from Australia. I was born in Central West New South Wales as the only (that I know) child of two addicts. My father was convicted at fourteen and spent most of his life before I was born as an aggressive and depressed alcoholic and drug dealer. He met my mother when she was in her early 20s and he established himself to my mother and her sister as a dealer. Within a few years he managed to get her to marry him and then dragged her out to a town (population of under 300) in to the middle of the country where the land is almost completely barren, not even the kangaroos would live there. He kept her there for more than a decade, during which time I was born. Through their various rages at me I've learnt from them that she still used coke and ecstasy throughout her pregnancy with me, but mainly used oxycodone^1. My mother left him when I was 18 months but I have vague memories and flashbacks^2 from then of dark rooms, shocking heat and a woman begging and screaming. She managed to escape to the coast on a train and found a women's refuge and managed to sober up enough to get us a dingy unit before my father followed her and found himself somewhere to live nearby. Between the ages of 2 and 5 I was relatively happy but this was really the beginnings of her abuse. I don't particularly think she meant to but she is and was so fucked up by the things that happened to her at the hands of my father and by the drugs themselves (which were evidently more varied than what I've been informed of) that I don't know whether to pity her or not. Between the ages of four and sixteen she forced me into seeing 12 counsellors, 8 psychologists, and 6 psychiatrists. I was diagnosed with depression, social anxiety, ADHD, ADD, Borderline Personality Disorder and manic depression, among other things, and was put on more and more prescription drugs as the time went on. But this was all masking the actual issues, which was that she beat me. She hit me, kicked me, pulled my hair out, forced soap so far down my throat she knocked out some of my teeth, and locked me in my bedroom for days at a time. I've done some reading online and she fits most if not all of the symptoms of Münchausen's Syndrome by Proxy, that she tried to gather sympathy for herself through me and tried to make it look worse by faking and even causing me to have illnesses. This became worse when my father, who refused to leave the city, took her to the family courts and managed to get dual custody of me when I was 7. I spent tuesday nights and even second weekends at his unit before then (from the age of 5), and became used to checking for syringes and broken glass in the grass and it was at that time that I saw my first dead body hunched over on the stairwell to our unit, surrounded by blood. Regardless, he still managed to get dual custody of me because I was more scared of my mother than my father at that point and over the course of that year (2002) I spent equal time between the two hovels. In the summer of 2003 my mother had one of her friends stay for two weeks. This friend and her son (a year older than me) stayed in my room and not only did I have to sleep in my mother's room (sometimes her bed, sometimes the floor), but I wasn't allowed in my bedroom at all. One afternoon I tried to go in my room to pick out a book to read and her friend pushed me out, pushed me against the wall and screamed at me. I started crying, ran into the kitchen and grabbed a knife before slicing into my throat. My mother saw it, called my father, and had him take me away to his house. I didn't see my mother again for close to two years, except for one time I was in hospital.* I had always had hearing difficulties, and my first year with my father doctors found out I had tumours in my head ( NOT brain tumours, they're between the brain and the skull itself) and I had my first operation to remove them then. Since then I've had 5 more surgeries, each time they've more aggressive (to the point of brain fluid leaking on the operating table and weeks in hospital to recover). The time taken to recover from the procedures, as well as other complications^3 has lead me to decide that it's better to live to 35 relatively normally than to 55 and spend half the time in bed and in pain. Essentially, I'm halfway through my life already, and I'm okay with that now. I'm a big girl, and I've had years to make this decision. So between 2003 and 2005 (age 8-10) I lived with my father exclusively and I don't remember much about this period besides vague memories, flashbacks and night terrors, mostly of things he did to me, or things he threatened to. Every couple of weeks he would grab onto my arm and pull me to the front door saying he was taking me 'to buy a box'. This box, he said, would need to be taken care of because as soon as we got home he would pack my clothes into it and drive me to _ , this suburb known for being a red-light district with more murders than births each year, as well as lots of gang activity. He said that within a week I'd be selling myself from this cardboard box, within a month I'd be shooting up inside it, within a year I'd be giving birth inside it, and within a decade I'd be buried inside it in an unmarked grave, as a sign of how worthless I am. That's stuck with me ever since, and it's still hard to process how he could hate his only daughter that much. I also remember him pretending to kill himself in front of me before getting up, cackling with glee, and pinning my hands behind my back and locking me in my room for a few days with just a bucket to piss in, a loaf of bread, and a lettuce. He also... lit my vagina on fire at one point. I don't remember it, I've blocked it out, but I've got burn scars over my vulva. He never told me why but as I've grown up I've worked out that he didn't want me to be able to have casual sex, if any sex at all. I don't know if he molested me, I wouldn't say I know he did, but it wouldn't surprise me given the burns and the fact that when I behaved he would 'reward me' by making me sleep in his bed, and before he went to sleep he'd turn the television to porn channels. I lost my virginity when I was twelve to this boy from school and he showed me that not everyone will hurt me, and I loved that feeling. I lived through it for years. I dropped out of school when I was thirteen because I was already earning a reputation and a group of boys would beat me up (to the point of broken bones) and sexually assault me a couple of times a week. I kept my mouth shut because these boys' parents were friendly with the principal and nobody would believe what I said anyway. But I got fed up eventually and in September 2008 I walked out of class and never went back. It seems that nobody even noticed me missing from school because nobody ever came to check on me. So, I began walking on a bad path, I met some people, had a lot of stupid sex, formed an addiction to it, and I moved drugs on the side for some income. Most of which I had to pay in rent to my mother in order to stay there instead of living on the street again. I was sixteen I overdosed. I'd had enough and really just reeling from some news I'd got a few months before^3. My mother's oxy^1 use (and perhaps the burns as well) had left me sterile. I had believed that I was going to be a mother one day and prove to myself I could be a better parent to my own children than mine were to me, but this was basically a slap in the face, and is one of the reasons I'd rather die at 35 than 55. There's just not that much use in me being alive any longer than that if there's nobody relying on me. Alas, evidently I didn't die then but I felt absolutely crap just looking at where I was in life so I decided to start a course and finish high school. I finish it completely next month, but I've stopped caring about it any more. It just isn't something that caters to my interests, and I'm not any happier now either. However, just before I started my course I met my ex boyfriend, this was mid 2012. We were in different social classes, but I figured he loved me because we had enough in common. I guessed wrong. We were together for more than a year, not that long for most people, but longer than anything I've managed before that. He was sweet, caring, and his family liked me, and I gave him every part of me that I could. But this wasn't enough and he turned obsessive, paranoid, nasty and abusive. Oh, and he cheated on me with another girl, which he used as a reason to break up with me, though that wasn't the reason I was given; which was that apparently his mother had seen me smoking crack, when I'd never even touched the stuff. But I was okay with that, I knew I was better off without him. This was mid 2013. 2013 was a clusterfuck. My grandmother died, my boyfriend dumped me 3 days after my 18th bithday, my dog died a month later and then, the pièce de résistance, I was raped by the man who lives next door to me. This was October 5th 2013. My finals started a week later and I failed all of them because I wasn't able to study, and I had panic attacks during the exams themselves. It's been a year and I still live next to him, and I can't afford to move. The Police said they can't do anything because I have no proof (besides scars) and the only things that are keeping me sane at this point is my other dog (a Great Dane), my best friend (who is pretty much my new boyfriend), my bong, and a bayonet from the First World War which I keep beside my bed to give me some feeling of security. My house caught fire in April, and a few months later the bolts to my screen door were cut. Twice. My mother laughed at me when I told her that I was raped because she likes the guy, but over the past 12 months we've begun to repair our relationship though I'm still wary of her and mainly use her to help me do my grocery shopping because I can't afford a car and this area has too many hills to be able to carry the bags home. On a side note, my mother told me that my father moved to the US (Arizona) in late 2008 and married a banker before beating her, divorcing her, taking her money and fleeing to Mexico. I haven't heard about him in two years, and I haven't spoken to him since early 2008. I know I need therapy, I know I've got problems. I can't sleep unless I'm stoned because of my PTSD^2 and I'm still dealing with sex addiction, but I've recently kicked my cigarette addiction (of a pack a day for around 4 years, and half packs for 3 years) which I've got going for me. Which is nice. I could really do with some advice on what to do.Summary:
Summarize: Rude! What is important is that our visible members are comfortable in themselves. I was in the same boat as OP for years. I grew up in one of the most conservative areas in Virginia. The coming out process is different for everyone. It is possible to be gay and not have a huge sex drive. One of my closest friends confided in me the other day that he hadn't fapped since March and hasn't had sex in two years. It's just something that he isn't after, and it just doesn't appeal to him. For me, I didn't choose to come out until pretty late in my college career. It was just a time that I felt right doing it. It is fine to not be seeking a relationship romantic, sexual, or otherwise. To the OP, after reading some of your other posts in this thread, I feel like you have a conflict between your conservative views and homosexuality. That is a part of the coming out process, especially for those that come from really conservative backgrounds. Personally, I grew up in a fundamentalist Baptist Church. It doesn't get much more conservative than that, haha. Through my own personal journey, I found my own self acceptance.Summary:

Summarize: Hey guys, Just want some opinions if this would seem creepy/weird. (I'm a 26 male btw) So I was at a bar last weekend with some friends and I was going to grab myself a drink so I asked the group if they wanted any. One of the girls in the group asked for another glass of Muscat, so I went to get the drinks but was told they ran out of Muscat and had to go to the resturant bar to order more. I went to the resturant bar and there was this really cute girl behind the bar, I asked for the Muscat and she didn't look like she knew if they had and looked a bit confused, so she looked around and saw it on the top shelf, she's fairly short so she pulled a box over to stand on and I laughed, she turned and said "If I fall over and have to get stitches I'm blaming you and you'll have to take me to hospital". After she poured the glass she said it's $7 and asked if that's how much it was last time, I jokingly said it was only $5 last time while smiling and she laughed. Later on that night she was at the main bar and came over to serve and then she saw it was me and says "Oh it's you, I'm not serving you!" and starts walking off as a joke but then comes back and serves me. I was planning on asking for her number a bit later in the night and after a bit more "liquid courage" but about half an hour later I saw her with her bag on her shoulder walking out the doors. So my main question is would it be weird if I went back there next weekend, hopefully she'll be working again and as a joke asking for some Muscat (So she will remember who I am), and try and talk to her and get her number (but not make it look like I'm there just for that reason, friend and his wife said they'd come along to make it look like we are there for a few more drinks). I know I should have asked for it straight away instead of waiting and missing my opportunity, and I suck at picking up on girls flirting with me but looking back it sounds like she was flirting quite a bit! :-\Summary:
Summarize: SJWs have been trying to get people to switch to another tag ever since GamerGate started to weakent he movement. Don't fall for that shit. They kept talking about how the only way GG could have credibility was switching the tag (like they would pretend another one would be any different). There were other retarded arguments for it, I just can't recall them.Summary:
Summarize: When I was 5, I used catch the biggest ant I could find and try to rip its legs off and laughed at its futile attempt to bite me. Their heads came off everytime before I could get all the legs. Needless to say, I don't think i've ever encountered fire ants.Summary:
Summarize: I'm kind of in this boat too. Reading r/atheism, seeing all the crap in the news and wondering why the hell people who claim to have the moral high ground are so filled with hate. Granted, I've never been a great Christian, but the more time I spend in the real world (i.e. not at home with my parents) the more I see how absolutely backwards Christianity has become. My religion is hanging by a thread and I'm holding a pair of scissors wondering if I should cut it. It's completely stupid, the number of justifications I have to make to make Christianity as my parents believe work for me, and I'm not so sure I want to any more.Summary:
Summarize: Holy fucknuggets, thank you! I'm in the Victory Road trying to train my Leavanny against Boldores. I use Leaf Blade, super fucking effective, but no. Mother. Fucking. Sturdy. Boldore then proceds to rape my Leavanny with Smack Down, and by then I'm just losing my shit.Summary:
Summarize: The worst part about it is that I built it myself. Brick by brick, fixing it all in place. I've been surrounding myself with a cold, dark, hard room. I didn't notice how bad it had gotten until I realised I hadn't seen any friends for almost 5 months. I sit at home, alone. I go to class, alone. I come back, alone. Then I sit and watch TV shows or movies on my computer. I don't go anywhere else, don't interact with anyone else. The only thing that stops my chest from feeling tight, stops my hands shaking or stops my head from feeling like I just spun around in a chair for an hour is being able to lose myself in music or a fictional world. It's gotten to the point that I barely eat anything throughout the day, just staring at a screen, or staring at my roof with headphones on. On the bus or train to class I sit and stare out the window, headphones in, avoiding eye contact. I try sitting by myself, choosing to stand over sitting next to anyone. I was never close with my family (aside from my parents, I don't have any family living in the same country). The problems have bled in to my studies. It started getting bad about a year and a half ago, I would feel shaky and breathing would get difficult right before an exam. Over the last few months it's gotten worse, I feel that way almost as soon as I hear about the exam or assignment. I was never the most hard working student, but I never really let myself get close to failing. Now I'm worried that I could fail almost half my subjects in one semester. My parents both want me to go on and do a postgrad degree, which I don't think I want to do, and know I wouldn't be able to cope with. I don't have any to talk to about this, and I'm scared of the direction that my thoughts have turned to. The word "useless" echos through my mind everyday, more times than I can count. I can't remember the last day that I didn't think about killing myself. Ever since high school finished I drifted away from all of my friends. I don't feel like I deserve to have friends. I was always shy and quiet as a kid, it's gotten to a different level recently. Whenever I'm out at class, instead of trying to make new friends, I hide away in my shell until I can come home. Whenever I use to see them I consciously kept them at arms length, "If they really got to know you, they would hate you". Now I actively push them away, don't return calls, ignore messages (not that I get many of either, maybe once a month at most, closer to once every few months). Cannot blame them, who would stay friends with someone that tries to actively avoid them. I've tried letting out the frustration, but I can't. I can't scream, I can't cry, everything either feels numb or feels like my chest is going to explode. Don't understand why this is happening or why it keeps getting worse every day. I feel weak, then hate myself for my lack of strength. I hate myself when I don't see my friends, yet I hate myself too much to actually think I deserve to see them. It feels like I'm throwing myself against the walls and bars of my own psyche, futily, trying to escape from my thoughts, but just beating myself up even more. I just want to be free from all of this. Sorry if this is poorly written, I'm just tired, hazy and frustrated. I don't know if it's anxiety, or if it's depression, or if I'm just weak. Just needed to write something.Summary:

Summarize: Actually, I call bullshit on this whole thing. I think you're Skeona. Remember 1 month ago when you posted in AskReddit [asking why your posts never showed up in /r/gaming]( Someone gives you the [helpful advice to get a new username and start over]( Then TADAAAA, [Skeona]( is born. In fact, you submitted 30 links to reddit in a couple of months until that point, and since then hardly anything. Also the fact that you're even posting in here only 2 hours since the original post was made, despite the fact that you claim to have very little knowledge of Reddit and 'don't check the site too often or anything'.Summary:
Summarize: So, all ye civil and structural engineers, architects, and building officials: the special inspector can act as your eyes in the field. Regardless of whether or not you "trust" us (I have found most do not), we are the subsitute for those contractors' lacking conscience. Granted, I've worked with many special inspectors who aren't worth a shit; though, they're not necessarily disingenuous or not to be trusted, just lazy with a sense of entitlement. Wouldn't it behoove you to try an establish a pretty sold repertoire and degree of trust with someone who plays such a significant role on your project(s)? My best experiences in the industry have been developed through mentoring opportunities with engineers. If an inspector doesn't consider something he's looking at 'important' or know about it, they will most likely overlook it and choose to make no comments in their reports. If they understand why this spec or detail reads this way and not another, you can be certain they will do a better inspection, aka 'observation' (for their DFRs). When an engineer wants to treat the value of my experience as less than their own, I will go above and beyond to prove my worth; however MOST other inspectors will treat your job like shit in retaliation for your disrespect. Long story short, you should trust your special inspectors, they can make or break a project for you and your firm.Summary:
Summarize: So I get to my local smoke shop to buy a new bowl piece, because the other one broke a couple days ago. I buy some cheap one since I only had about 10 bucks with me. Me feeling like I just bought my own island, I wanted to break this piece in, so I proceeded to the beach. Now I get out of the car reaching with my busted wrist into my pocket dropping the fucker right in front of my eyes. After the accident, I went back into my car and sat there in shock, realizing I don't have any more money for a new piece. I was literally seconds away from smoking, now I took the second obvious choice and decided to masturbate until I felt good to drive again.Summary:
Summarize: 2 years ago i was at an American Eagle with a friend; he was in the dressing room trying on some jeans so i decided to look around the store. I was by where t-shirts were when all sudden this somebody grabbed me by the collar of my shirt and twisted me around. It was a little kid who started laughing at me no bigger than me about 5 or 6. I remember getting into an uncontrollable rage picking the kid up by his shirt and body slamming into the table. This all happened in the span of 15 seconds but felt like 15 minutes. I finally snapped out of it realized what i had just done and ran the fuck out of there. Called me friend to meet me in the car, apparently the kid wouldnt stop crying. Normally i dont care when the kids point and laugh; I would also never hurt a child on purpose. So my question is have you done anything like this before or am i alone?Summary:

I'm going to quote the HHG2TG and say that the one thing you can't have in this world is a sense of perspective. And if you choose to have a slightly narrower perspective (teehee, choose) then you really are to blame.Summary:
Summarize: I'm a guy of slightly larger than the "average" genital size (~6.5-7" length, 4.5" - 5" circumference)going by wiki , but just a bit over. The smallest porn star would easily put me to shame. Even so, if I wear standard-sized condoms my bits get so constricted width-wise that I can only wear them for a short time without being in real pain. They almost act like a cock-ring(keeping all the blood inside and keeping me erect even after intercourse) but a cock-ring that is too small. I've tried trojan/durex/lifestyles and just about any other brand of regular sized condoms I can find in stores. The only couple I've tried that actually seem to fit properly are Trojan Magnum, lifestyles "XL", or lifestyles SKYN "XL" I think they are called. Buying them has problems too because of the stereotypical person that buys a magnum condom (the usually young, immature type that wants to show everyone he has a big dick, sharing it on facebook and anywhere else he can post a picture). Even in the military I think it was they had to reissue condoms with sizes renamed because the soldiers would only take magnum-sized condoms when passed out for free which lead to the magnums running out and no one taking the regulars. There is also a great deal of hate both off and on the internet for anyone buying magnums b/c hate the above-mentioned stereotypical buyer and people feel the standard size fits all because condoms can stretch. Well, yes, they might stretch if you apply some real force to them, but they don't stretch like that simply by putting them on your penis. Does anyone else have this particular problem? Are there condoms out there that are just a bit wider without me needing to buy the less-than-modest Magnum packaging?Summary:
Summarize: I'm sorry, I don't mean to sound negative but... Wings is apparently big guy. As it seems a really... big guy. He can build muscles... but exercise is more than likely going to help him lose weight, not build it. I'm not quite sure if he's lost a lot of weight or just under 50 pounds, but until he gets down to at least 300, his body is going to be wanting to burn the excess weight. Of course, muscle will build, but there's just so much excess fat in the body that will go first.Summary:
Summarize: I think i get nervous and i get those feelings. But sometimes its not because i feel nervous..... Yea think how i feel.. The only way i can describe it is: Feeling disconnected from my body. Immediat retreat is what i naturally NEED to do (as in leave the current situation. Shaking my hands, forcing a cry/vomiting are what i want to do. I have been having this happen to me since i was 17, i am turning 23 in july. I am a male and have never seen anybody with anxiety as bad as i have it. For the first 6 months i couldn't leave my house. Tried busparone, hated it. Backstory: I smoked alot of pot, and when i mean alot i mean that all i did. One day i smoked some weed and BAM SHIT>FAN. never been right since then. But when i think about it, i had these "feelings" even when i was very young but never thought anything of it. I am an overthinker, i stress over shit way the fuck too much. I understand that but thanks for telling! What can i do? i want an answer. I am in the middle of looking for a better job (i have a college degree), but am so fucking nervous that i will BE nervous that its controlling my life. If my heart rate gets up at all i freak out. I stop skateboarding, smoking, exercising because i couldn't handle it. to top it off i have a fast metabolism that i eventually turned into if im hungry, i panick! I have seen counselors nothing helped... seems like nothing is ever going to help me. I honestly just want to share with you all while i read your stories, i like them. They make me feel like im almost normal.Summary:
Summarize: I've been waiting to share this story since I joined Reddit. It's a bit of a novel but to this day my words and actions are checked because of this event. All having to do with an event that happened back in the 5th grade day... I had come home from school one day and overheard one of my friends using the word prostitute (I think it was a South Park episode that he had watched). So I, being the naive sheltered kid started using the word and soon enough it had become an integrated part of my vocab. I was at a golf camp that summer for kids ages 8-14. I was playing a match against my friends little 8 year old brother and when something would not go my way I would say "Wow... what a gay prostitute." I had called him a "gay prostitute" a bunch of times throughout the course of the round, not really thinking anything of it because hey, I had no idea what it meant and they were just words. Fast forward two days later... I'm in my room building the Imperial Tie Fighter lego kit and I hear my mom SCREAM my name from downstairs telling me to get downstairs immediately. The usage of the middle name was the dead giveaway that I was FUCKED, but I digress. I see both of my parents at the foot of the stairs and my Dad looks me dead in the eyes and says: "So you think you're a big tough guy huh?" I replied with a shaky "What?" to which he responded "Don't give me that 'What' shit" (my parents don't swear so this was a huge 'this is how I die' moment). My mom was crying and told me to get in the car. She told me she had received a call from my friends dad who told me the little brother had been brooding in his room since that day. His dad asked him what was wrong and he asked his dad what a "gay prostitute" was. They had to have a family meeting to discuss what had happened, decided to notify the golf course of the event, and notify my parents. We drove 4 minutes down the road to his house where his entire family were outside waiting for me. I have never been so sorry about anything in my whole life. Those two words had ruined his innocence. I cried in front of his whole family and my mom and begged them to forgive me. Which they did. I also got a call from the Head Pro saying she wanted to have a meeting with me and told me that her initial reaction was she wanted to bar me from playing in the rest of the camp but his family kindly said that was a little extreme. Looking back on this event it I know this 100% changed me and helped make me who I am today. I've bumped into them a couple of times since (no longer living by me) and I feel so awkward and awful many years later. I wish I could take those words back but younger me needed a reality intervention quick.Summary:

A month ago a long time friend moved away and hubs and I realized that we have been really crappy about maintaining contact with those who have moved. So, we decided that we are going to be taking a trip to visit friends in GA and AZ this fall. That means tank tops and shorts.. umm yeah.. not the way things were. So, I threw in weight training to the mix, 4 times a week and at least 5 days of walking 1.5+ miles. [Here]( is where I am. Pix on 3 dates, 4/22, 5/4, and 5/11. Am I seeing things??Summary:

Summarize: ugh. this is a gross one and TMI but I had a baby last year. A couple of months after I got my first post partum period. My OB said it would probably be lighter and it was. So I set out for a trip to the mall. Now I should probably say that I was at least 20lbs heavier than I am now, holding a baby because she refused to sleep in her stroller, and I was sweating my balls off in a poorly chosen outfit (I was dressed for 50 degrees and it was more like 70). So I'm sweating and noticing a large amount of ...for lack of a better phrase... swamp ass. Not really thinking much of it I decide to leave and head into the parking lot. I start noticing more and more wetness but Im thinking, okay im walking pretty quickly in the hot sun. I put baby in the car, get in and go WTF. Red all the way down to my knees. Yep. OB was wrong, my period was super heavy.Summary:
Summarize: I'd like to refer you to a [post]( someone just made on this very subreddit. Sometimes 50/50 isn't achievable by the system in short order. It all depends on how the games play out. >It's not that i can't handle losing Well are you having fun when you're losing? That's what the objective should be. Even when you're getting your ass stomped into the ground by a smurf premade or something, you should be trying to have fun. If you are, great, winning and losing shouldn't matter to you. If you aren't, then that's what I meant by being able to handle it. I mean if you're only having fun half the time, what's the point in playing at all? Sounds like the net gain of 1 hour of being miserable and 1 hour of fun is fairly neutral to me. I mean, you could go to a different game, or make cookies or something. Cookies, are fucking delicious. I'm not trying to get you to quit here, just trying to make a point. If the game isn't fun for you, you do have alternatives, and if it is fun then why are you here making this post on reddit instead of just playing more? :P Just keep playing, try to improve, learn new things. That's how dota stays fun for me. Learning and improving. I learn something new EVERY time I play, even though I've been playing since back in the guinsoo days. Found out using Hand of Midas on the Red Necro unit doesn't blow you the fuck up last session. My mind, was BLOWN. Seriously, the entertainment value of this game all comes down to how you perceive what happens. Dying doesn't have to be a bad thing, nor does losing. Hell Dark Souls expansion is called "Prepare to Die," and people (myself included) fucking love that game. It's kind of Weird, butSummary:
Summarize: About exactly a week ago I had sex and made out with someone I know, and just recently (in the last few days) they felt ill and went to the doctor because they thought they had the flu. The doctor told them they have mono. Obviously if I've never been exposed to mono, I might have definitely been infected. However, as far as I'm aware, I have not been infected in youth. Then again I wouldn't know. So what the fuck do I do? I can't afford to be taking off work at all because I recently took off a few days because I had the flu, and I'm new to the job. They'll kill me if I take any more days off. Also, i don't want mono! FmlSummary:
Summarize: Trying to pay people a liveable wage, what a stupid concept. Single mothers of the world, your bad choices mean that there is not hope you will ever be able to change and expect better for your kids. Live on minimum wage and see what it feels like. Or even better, work at a food pantry and see how man are unemployed vs. how many are people working 30 hours a week at Wal-Mart or are retired on social security. The same faces you see as cogs in a machine are the people in those lines.Summary:
Summarize: So here's my story, I'm 19 and start a little sesh, just me in my room at like 11, 1130 at night. Turns out my mom was still awake and could smell the Green Goddess coming from my room (I probably should have hid the smell better, but it was 11 and my mom's usually asleep by then, except this time. Also she smoked in school so she knows the smell) So my mom confronts me about it the next day and doesn't seem too mad, just disappointed. She tells me she better not catch me do it again and all that stuff. But then yesterday my dad comes to the house (my parents separated a few months back and my dad comes to visit my sister and I so he can see how were doing and stuff, his place is small and he doesn't live alone so we don't go there) my mom tells him what I did, and it gets bad (but not as bad as it could have been) the first thing he says is "what the fuck is this smoking dope shit!" and he just keeps going and yelling at me, I thought I was done for. My dad has a problem with alcohol and doesn't want me going down the same road and he used to smoked, but I know not to end up like that. My dad was arrested for his third dui before I was even born. So anyway my dad told me he better not hear about this again and I better not smoke while driving and that stuff. The thing that amazed me is I didn't lose my stuff!Summary:
Summarize: I feel like any expression is never a cause of immediate concern, but it is something to raise an eyebrow over. It's not that she has wedding magazines, it's that she is Hiding the magazines. Obviously no cause for alarm, but I would certainly watch myself over certain gestures that may get her hopes up over things that are not entirely intentional. Like if you got your kid a car magazine and then took him to a car lot on his 16th birthday only to say, which new car should I get? There is a certain level of dishonesty and let down that may be unintentional but still very real. I guess my take away for the real world is that: people get divorced and people question how little marriage means, and how nobody takes it seriously. She buys a bridal magazine, and marriage doesn't even matter, it's just a fun hobby to look at. Is a life long commitment a light-hearted subject, or something to take seriously? Because I got a tattoo and my mother still gives me shit after 3 years.Summary:

Summarize: I went out one night and invited a long-term buddy (let's say Hans). He showed up with a guy none of our usual group knew (let's say Kevin). Kevin kept hitting on my girlfriend and I tried to play it cool and redirect attention elsewhere. Fast forward 3 hours, I (and my SO) get tired of the relentless passes made by Kevin and end up in a scuffle. I knocked him out in front of ~6 cops (busy, bar-side of town). He comes to, I'm in hand cuffs, he decides to "let it slide" and we all go home after a miserable night out. This is where the story of friendship goes full retard. One hour after we got home, Hans shows up with Kevin to my house (complete opposite side of the tracks from his/their house) where Kevin proceeds to scream obscenities, threatening to kill me and waving a gun around. At that moment I realized my long-time buddy had terrible decision making skills. We say hi if we end up in the same place (mutual friends and shit).Summary:
Summarize: I was 25 at the time and had divorced a few months prior. After my divorce I went into full manwhore mode. I'm a decent looking dude, 6'1", 205#, dirty blonde hair, blue eyes, I'm no gym rat but I have a job that keeps me active all day and in good shape. I'm 3rd wheeling it at a bar with my friend and his GF. We are getting shitty drunk (an every night thing for me at the time) and his GF says "I think my friend is coming to hang out with us." Cool, the more the merrier. About 20 minutes later her friend shows up. We will call her T, for the sake of anonymity. T is about 5"2 in heels, 100#, fiery green eyes, and a strawberry blonde. She was a solid 8.5 on a 10 scale when sober. In my condition she looked like an eleventeen. She orders up a vodka and red bull, and I exchange my empty beer for a fresh one. All 4 of us are chatting and laughing. And I noticed she touched my arm when she laughed...always a good sign. By the end of that round my friend and his GF wanted to shoot some pool. They get up to go grab a rack of balls and pick out some cues. As they left the table she leaned over, put her hand in my crotch and started rubbing my dick. She looks me in the eyes and smirks. "Follow me". Being the gentleman I am I oblige without question. She grabs her purse and leads me to the women's bathroom. Well by this time the fuckstick is at full mast and we go into the handicap stall. I close the door and lock it and she sits down on the toilet. I walk over and she unbuckles my belt, unbuttons my jeans, pulls down my boxers and starts giving me some violent head. She is deep throating and gagging. Spitting on my dick and jerking with the fervor of a porn starlet. She has my undivided attention. She pulls my member out of her mouth and asks if I have a condom as she continues stroking my crank. FUCK! "Nope, but I can go get one." She reaches for her purse sitting on the railing and fishes one out. Perfect! She hikes up her dress and pulls off her lacy little black thong to reveal a beautiful slick shaven pussy with a finger-width landing strip. She throws the soaked panties in her purse. She stands up, turns around and has one foot on the floor and her knee on the toilet seat. There, in all of its glistening glory, was my perfectly presented prize. I push myself into her and she starts cooing. I'm in awe that I'm full on fucking some woman that I've known for the course of a beer...fuck it. Trim is trim, and I'm in. I'm balls deep in T and rage fucking this girl. Balls slapping clit, she's moaning, and the rougher I get the more she soaks my rod and wails. She's a screamer. I give zero fucks at this moment. I hear the bathroom door opening and closing, toilets flushing, hand dryers cycling on and off...it doesn't phase me one bit. At times I hear women's voices...not T's and some are whispering, some laughing...I don't pay attention or acknowledge their words. I am completely zoned in on fucking the living shit out of T. It could have been two minutes since we began, it could have been an hour. Time was lost to me at this point and in my condition. She's moaning and screaming to god...there is no god here, only a sexually explosive man in the throes of a post divorce, self serving, fuckstravaganza. She lunges forward as I feel myself crashing into her cervix...she is trembling and shaking and tells me she wants me to come in her mouth. "Turn around". I rip off the condom dripping with her juices and shove my lube and precum covered dick into her mouth. She starts bobbing her head and fiddling with my balls...wham! I come like the fury of 1000 badgers spun out on crank, deep in her throat. She half chokes, half coughs, and the next wave of semen comes pouring from my member into her mouth. She continues to stroke me and squeeze my throbbing dick and coax every last drop from me. "Fuck yes! Let's get a drink and go shoot some pool!" She said through smiling lips, my once erect member shrinking in her hand. I pull up my boxers and my jeans as she takes a quick piss. She dries off and stands up. "I'm not putting my panties back on, they're soaked and I would just have to take them off again when we get home in a while." I wash my hands and as we exit the women's bathroom. There stands my buddy with a full on shit-eating grin, his girlfriend, and half a bar-full of strangers. My buddy hi-fives me and everyone is laughing cheering and clapping. I exclaim "who needs a beer? I need a smoke!" T was smiling and laughing, she wasn't embarrassed in the least. We stayed at that bar until closing. I got my tab for the night and it was only 12 bucks. The bartender said that a bunch of people were paying for my beers all night. And that I better not pull that shit again in his place. Fair enough. T and I were fuck buddies for a while but that all ended when she caught up to me at the same bar and I was with another woman. She got pissed and dramatic, and went completely left when I reminded her that told her I didn't want anything exclusive.Summary:
Summarize: I worked as a supervisor at a shitty service-industry venue in Portland, OR, for about 5 years. There were 3 other supervisors, and also my boss, the General manager. In the first year there, I was obviously the fresh meat, the new guy, so I got a lot of manual labor/shitty tasks dumped on my lap. Whatever, the work flow there was so light it was either do these tasks or be bored. Anyway, it was Portland. My fellow supervisors were huge hipsters, and aggravatingly close-minded about music. There was a CD player in the office, and they would pump Elliot Smith or some other depressing indie stuff constantly. I chose not to use it when anyone else was around - I knew nobody would like my music, so I chose not to subject anyone to it that didn't want to listen. So, the only times I would use it was when I closed and when no one else was there, which was almost every night. So, one night, we have a bunch of extra work to do, and low and behold, it all gets dumped on me. I was the closer, so when anyone had a party or anything to do, they'd dump the extra work on me, because I was going to be there all night anyway, right? Yeah, ok, whatever. I can deal with extra work. So, it's getting fairly late, and the last other supervisor had just gotten changed to go to a party. So she takes off, I'm left alone, and I decide to play some tunes while doing paperwork (NOTE - I don't play music loud. I'm just not comfortable with not being able to hear my surroundings). About an hour later, a different supervisor comes in to get something. They walk right into the office, and straight to the CD player and turn it off. "I don't need to hear this shit," he says. He gets some piece of paper and leaves. He's known to be a dick, so I shrug it off and keep working, turning the music back on once he's left. Then about 30 minutes later, the previous supervisor comes back because she left something there. As soon as she walks in, she walks over to the CD player, turns it off, and just gives a "ugh, gross." She proceeds to make some bitchy remarks about her shitty life, I'm pissed so I don't give a fuck, and I wait until she leaves. That's it. Now, what I wanted to do was piss on all their stuff. I imagined in my mind, of getting one of the large tupperware tubs from the back and fillin' it up with piss, and dumping any personal possession of theirs in it. I didn't though, I feel that probably would have went over-the-line. So, I wasn't just doing paperwork that night. I was doing a lot of manual labor, and I was sweaty as hell. I took all their stupid fucking hipster bullshit CDs, and literally wiped my balls with them. The sweat stains left all over the CDs were disgusting, and fucking hilarious. For the rest of both of their employment there, I giggled every time they picked up one of those CDs up, right before eating a meal on break. Moral of the story: Don't be a fucking dick about music. It's about as meaningful as arguing what everyone's favorite color is.Summary:
Summarize: You understood what I said, but the difference is in our approaches to what it means to be racist. Largely we are taught that a racist person is inherently a bad person. The assumption behind that is that there are very few racists and the rest of us are not racist. Understanding how racism works, that is not the case. Racism isn't about "hate" or even disadvantage; racism is about privilege. The central tenet of racism is that certain people are "normal," "natural," and capable of individuality. So, in Western culture, white is seen as being normal while all others are seen as somehow abnormal. The important part of this is that everyone raised in our culture is taught to think this (including people who aren't white). As a result, everyone is heavily influenced by this racism. If everyone is influenced by this racism, then pointing out or shaming a specific racist is a case of the pot calling the kettle black. We are all racist. So, me pointing out the racism in your desire isn't me saying you are a bad person (I'd guess that you are far from it since you seem to be asking an actual question about something that could feel like a vicious accusation). However, we are responsible for the things we take part in, even when it's not our fault. So I would say yes, you are responsible for how you affect other people even if you are only a link in a chain you didn't start.Summary:
Summarize: I have thought about this before and while i think it is an interesting idea I think having actual crew members, like they currently have industry teams, is kind of pointless. What I think would be interesting is that since your ship already has a crew in place those crew members could offer a small buff to your ship as time goes along. For instance, if you are a PVP pilot and you take your Proteus out into a fight, and make it back alive, then your crew gets a buff to help you with DPS and Armor (depending on your ship set-up). That buff would be only a small number, not enough to outright win the next fight, but it could help you to have a tangible reward for using a ship and surviving a fight. Also, this would offer a bit more of a reality to the loss, losing your "Best Ship" means you have to start the buffing cycle over again. This way your ship is becoming better at what you intend to do with it. Using Mining lasers with a Hulk will give your crew members "XP" in mining proficiency, therefore allowing you a little more yield the next time you run out to the belts. It would all be based off of what modules you use, and that would return your time and efforts with a little boost in stats.Summary:
Summarize: Wow holy shit those bad guys are doing a pretty terrible job at pretending to get hit. The last two hits in particular are just not even close to landing. Then there's the dude that gets hit by the tv, and proceeds to raise his head up, then go back down then repeats that process until he needs to start fighting again, at which point he goes from unable to sit up to full steam fighting in like 2 seconds flat.Summary:
Summarize: It's absolutely horrible to lie like this. You destroy any and all trust, you ruin your credibility, and you make it so the child will never be able to enjoy anything in his/her life, because every time you tell him/her that you are doing something fun they will have a shock and fear response to it. You are creating problems that will affect that child into adulthood. What you SHOULD be doing is being HONEST to that child and teaching them that not everything is ice-cream and candy, but we need to face problems head on and deal with them. It may be difficult, but your child will learn to lean on you and trust you and will be equipped to deal with problems better. They will appreciate that you treated them with respect rather than lying like an asshole and traumatising them badly.Summary:
Summarize: I'm sure you guys get this question a lot. I have been lurking for a long time, as well in /r/relationships and /r/deadbedrooms. I even dabbled in /r/askwomen. Lurking and reading links, tips etc has been somewhat helpful, but I am so at a loss! I need help. I have an almost non-existent libido. I so want to want to have sex. Sex fascinates me, I read about it, try and find visual stuimulation etc. It sometimes turns me on, but not as much as everyone else. I know why, let me explain it to you. I am a 20 something female, currently at a considerably low stress job with very little things in my life to worry about (I get paid decently, my rent is cheap, I have few bills, I take online classes in a field that I am very educated in (so while decently challenging, I enjoy the learning and feel very little pressure). Sorry if this seems like I'm bragging, I'm just saying I'm pretty much as non-stressed as a college student can be.) I eat healthy, I am at a normal weight, I am in a healthy relationship with a 20 something male (who I live with). Here's the two major problems: 1) I was raped as a teenager. I've read it goes either way with rape vctims, either they get very hyper sexual or get a very low libido. I got lucky enough to be very sensitive to sex. If one thing is done wrong I am turned off not for the night, not for the day but something, and often for the entire week. It's fucking bananas. If a partner touches me in such a way (through no god damn fault of their own, how could they possibly know my ridiculously long list of triggers, right?) that I dislike or find triggering/bring up bad memories I just don't want them to touch me at all. It becomes a desert down there. 2) I was diagnosed with depression as a teenager, I have been seeing a therapist for almost a year and am in the process of being rediagnosed. Right now, it is some sort of depressive disorder, but the main theory my therapist has is an anxiety disorder. Basically, my brain gets anxious/scared and so it decides to squash those negative and scared thoughts by "depressing" me to calm me down. So, awesomely enough, if something scares me I know, I know. I need professional help, and I promise you I am getting it! The problem is, while I have made leaps and bounds with my weird depression disorder and trauma, my sex drive has not changed. You may be thinking, could it be the boyfriend? It's not. It's always been like this with every partner I've had. I'm not prude by any stretch of the imagination (mostly me trying to figure out why the hell I just don't want sex), and no one I've been with I've particularly felt the amount of lust It seems all the other people I talk to/read about have. Sex is pretty much always the last thing on my mind. Before this week, it had been two months since I last masturbated. My boyfriend and I have sex about once a week, mostly because I feel it's unfair to him to trap him in a relationship without sex. I am very attracted to him, why don't I want to have sex with him or anyone else?? What the hell body?? Like I said, this week I have been trying to masturbate a lot more. Even though I don't really get the urge to masturbate, I still do because it seems to raise my libido a bit more than normal. So my question to you is how can I raise my libido more in a way that I will actually crave sex/get horny? I can;t even tell you the last time I got horny without a very long time of foreplay, uhg. Yes, I know some are going to tell me to talk to my therapist and trust me, I have. We have been working with it. Her main theory is hopefully to just continue focusing on depression/trauma and the libido will follow suit. Not quite yet the case. Possibly I need to be more patient? Is there anything else I can do? Sorry if this a confusing post, I'm nervous/a little tipsy because I needed to get up the courage to post this...Summary:
Summarize: Sorry for the wall of text, thank you to all who read and give their input So a few weeks ago friends and I went to the local bar where we are local regulars and stayed for a few hours, we all left together to go smoke cigars. I came back after an hour or 2 to meet up with a girl I knew, we went in and the cocktail waitress was working, her and I started up a conversation and she pulled up a chair and we kept talking while the girl I was with just got out her phone and started texting. We talked about a local brewery and their beer. I felt bad so I ended the convo and turned back to the girl I brought. We later left girl I brought asked me to come home with her but since I wouldn't have a ride home in the morning I declined Went back to the same bar the next week and started talking to the cocktail waitress again. Walked in and was met with other regulars that all got up and gave me hugs etc. One of her coworkers was off for the night but in to have a few drinks asked me to dance so got up in the middle of the crowded bar and danced for a few mins before sitting back down. As the night ended I asked the waitress when we were going to have the beers we talked about the weekend before. She vanished into the bars kitchen for a second and came back with a piece of paper with her schedule on it, so I handed her my phone and got her name/number. Texted her about 20 mins later saying it was me and she texted back when she got off how I made her night better. There was small chat through text the next day set up a date on monday for thursday of last week. Her texts are always slow which is fine just different than what normally happens. Fast forward to Thursday I show up to pick her up from work about 10 mins early, sit in the back pull out my phone and jump on reddit. She gets my attention and has me sit by her while she finishes up her shift. Go out to dinner and it was awesome, Sat at dinner had steady conversation about everything, eye contact, kino the whole works. Get done with dinner ask her if she wants to go out, she does. Wants to go back to the bar where she works (think this is to test me to see if i can handle the attention she gets since it was a busy night at the bar) We stop by her place so she can change out of her work clothes, met her sister. On the way to the bar she talks about how she can cook all my fav food and wants to. Went to the bar talked to her friends and regulars. Walking in I let her go up to the bar and grab a seat while i stood and talked to one of her regulars about sports then came up and sat next to her. At the bar she said the guy next to her creeped her out so i pulled her closer to me, when i left and came back squeezed her shoulders as i cut in and she gave me that omg dont stop look. Anyways we leave around midnight her and her friend are going to another bar and I declined since I had to work at 5 and had a 30 min drive home. She gave me a hug and as I pulled away she kept her arms tight and looked up at me and I tilted my head she mirrored me. Think I could of went for a goodnight kiss but didnt since half of her coworkers were out on break and I went out with one of them and she was hating on me all night. So this is where I get confused I texted her the next day about how I had a great night and I'm excited to try her cooking. Heard nothing back until I went up there and we ran into her on break outside the bar She smiled and waved but no one wanted to pay cover so we kept going then she started texting me about how we should fix this food craving I was having lol So as the night goes on I get a little sloppy and we start texting back and forth pretty quickly no more hour long waiting periods for her to respond. Talk about how I am going back up at 5 to tailgate the football game and I should try to wake her up to come along with us. Texted her around 10 never heard from her then my phone died and when I got it charged I had a missed text from her. From then on havent really talked Tried to set up a date for tonight on monday said she would check her schedule, then she had to close so I asked when she didnt have to close and havent gotten a response back from her since. I know I will see her at the bar this weekend and I am really into her, shes one of the coolest girls I've metSummary:
Summarize: This happened to my friend once, except he has irritable bowel syndrome so it probably couldn't be helped. After getting to atheon in a little less than an hour, we were stuck there for a bit with a team that really wasn't working too well together. So after like 15 attempts at atheon my friend is just like fuck this and says I'm gonna take a shit and leaves the fireteam. We all thought, great it's over now. But we kept trying with 5. Fail after fail, my friend comes back after about 20 minutes. Atheon was down that round so maybe all you have to do is drop a dookie and atheon will drop like a turd.Summary:
Summarize: While I am sure you felt supremely righteous while stating (and probably rereading) that, the math alone makes no sense in comparison (time devoted), but also the fact you failed to consider if OC was multitasking, or in commute (train/bus, auto traffic or walking) or any other of the infinite possibilities that could allow OC to post a comment on Reddit, but prevent him from attending fund raisers (financial limitations, anybody?) or rally, shows that you are actually a fucking idiot that failed to critically analyze the situation, failed to logically asses the situation and failed to understand the complex nature of situations that aren't "black and white".Summary:
Summarize: There was once a huge village there. But one villager, Dan, decided he was fed up with his normal village life. Watching potatoes grow, conning passing players - he wanted some excitement. He began dumping gravel onto his friends heads, only to laugh in amusement as they got flint stuck up their huge noses. This carried on for quite some time, until the rest of the villagers became fed up with it. " Dan, we don't have time for your gravel shit. We're leaving. " They packed up all their belongings and left - leaving Dan trapped by his own item of amusement.Summary:
Summarize: I know what you mean. The last thing I want to do while driving is listen to shitty music on the radio. I don't want to wade in amongst the adds, radio "personalities", and teeny-bopper bullshit that passes as mainstream music these days, praying that the next song that receives airtime, just before I arrive at my destination, is something that I'll like. The main complaints in this thread is how people don't like the music being played by JJJ at the moment and how it was better when they played music you liked. WELL GO FUCK YOURSELF. If there is a certain type of music you like listening to, then go buy/download the albums of your favourite band and stop crying about it. In this day and age when everyone seems to have a device that'll play an mp3, I have no idea why you would bother with the radio. Hate the presenters? Go download a podcast. Hate Aussie Hip Hop? Download the music you actually like. It's not rocket surgery; it's common-fucking-sense.Summary:
Summarize: I've been to E3 several times, and I'll be going again this year. Every year, there's fewer and fewer things on the floor for non-media/biz reps. More and more developer- and publisher-specific titles are shown behind closed doors. Major exceptions are Sony/MS/Nintendo, which usually have tons playable stuff for their various platforms in their sections of the floor; it's usually the stuff that is coming out later that year. Last year, for example, Witcher 3 was BCD, with a huge line. So was The Division I waited for almost 3 hours in the line for The Division, only to have some fucking celebrities jump in front of me in line multiple times, effectively adding another hour to my wait. It wasn't worth it: the thing I waited 3 hours to see (not play) had already been released as a video online earlier in the day. In 2012, Watch_Dogs was BCD. Bethesda is notorious for having a giant box that no one other than special guests/bizdev people are allowed in. It's literally just a big cube with "BETHESDA" on it and a desk with a couple of people sitting behind it. EA is usually about 50/50 BCD and open floor. Ubisoft is about 75/25, and their shit is always set up with a minimum number of demo stations and has huge lines. Mobile games presence has ebbed and flowed; big publishers like GREE and GLU typically have little side booths with some random F2P stuff on there, but last year even that seemed to have gone down in quantity. Between the different wings of the convention center, there's random stuff set up. One year there was a kiosk for "Family Guy: The Quest for Stuff" set up in the food court. Literally in the food court. The major websites/magazines have their little sections as well. They pretty much just take up space and exist for ease of access for various interviews they have set up with developers (live plays, etc). Tons of news will come out of E3. It does every year. There are lots of other trade shows now; far more than there were 10 years ago. The question is, will E3 try to compete with those other shows, going bigger and bigger (like it did in the early 2Ks), or will they try to shrink it down like they did in '06 and focus it more on business?Summary:

Summarize: I was tripping more than I thought could be possible with weed, I can only imagine that I was at least at an [8] whereas before I had only been able to hit a good [4] or [5]. So, in detail, this is the story of how I got there and what it felt like, enjoy my leap to adulthood! Background: Yesterday I asked my friend to stay the night at my place and we could hang out. This friend we can call "Z". Z is the friend I always smoke with, he is the one who provides the bud, in fact, he's the one who introduced me to it a couple months ago. To his best ability he had tried to explain the effects of marijuana to me but every time we smoked, I never felt what he was talking about. I would usually get to a, still completely functional human being, kind of high, just a little more than a buzz even after an entire bowl. For a while though we only smoke Sativa. But last night that streak ended. Yesterday: Z shows up at around 9:00 and sets his bag down on the bar. Instantly he begins pulling out his bong, grinder, pill bottles, and a few other things. I didn't even expect to get high that night but since he insisted, I started preparing the bong with some ice and water while he pulls out a sweet nug and tells me that it's straight Indica, (Which I knew I had never smoked before).I was pretty excited. Grinded, packed, and prepared we took the bong to the back porch and sat down on a couch. ~9:45 Straight into it. I took the first hit, cornering the bowl (thanks to the 420 code), and coughed that shit out like a pussy. It had been a few weeks since I last smoked, plus I'm no veteran so yeah I have my excuses. I felt it though, I knew it was a good hit [2]. I passed it to Z and he took his, bigger than mine of course, but he didn't clear it. It sat for a few seconds when I noticed it wasn't cleared so I took the opportunity, coughed even worse after that. Z took another hit whilst I grabbed a couple waters and sat back down. After that I only took one more hit and cleared one of his and that's all we smoked. Later we would realize that it was merely the top of the bowl, but shit that's all it took to blast me. Stage 1. Within seconds of my last hit everything went weird. [6] I remember feeling like everything was moving at about 5 fps (for all you struggling PC gamers who know the feel). Z started the deep conversation and as much as I wanted to listen and partake, I was freaking out. I had never felt this before. My heart was racing, everything felt slow, and paranoia hit and I began telling Z, "Let's go inside, I'm having a bad trip." Z being the bro he is, calmed me down and informed me that I'm okay, I'm only on drugs, which now seems a bit counter-intuitive but it helped then. I began to think of how long this was going to last and how stupid I was to get this high. We eventually moved inside and sat on the couch watching TV. ~10:05 Stage 2. [8-9] I feel like I'm out of my body, floating somewhere, then I would come back and realize where I am. I kept forgetting where I was and what the hell was going on about every minute. But I would look at Z and be reminded of everything. I remember explaining to him what was going on somewhat like this, "It's like all that I see and know is our conversation, like you and me here right now connected. Then I look around and it's like I remember life, and I keep doing this every 5 minutes. Like holy shit there's a whole life out there and I just learned about it...again!" It was really cool to that this was happening. I was amazed at something that I literally live everyday. By this time I had remembered some advice I read on /r/trees saying not to worry, and just sit back relax, and enjoy it which is exactly what I began to do at this point. I was loving it. Although I realized my stupidity in how I was speaking and I apologized to Z saying sorry I'm not being deep right now and I'm talking really dumb. for example I kept thinking it had been DAYS when it had only been a few minutes. To which he replied, "Bro don't worry, I know for a fact that you're actually really smart." This got me more excited, I couldn't wait to get back to when I was going to be smart again. I was ripped. I got so excited that I was this high that I told Z we needed to watch some Lucas Bros. Moving Company since it's practically made to be watched while high. I ran upstairs to grab my laptop. ~10:30 Music. Glorious fucking music. At the top of the stairs I noticed my keyboard(Digital Piano). Instantly distracted I began playing. At first the keys seemed to be moving and I wasn't able to keep up, but I just trusted my instincts and began playing Fur Elise. Oh my God I was lost in the notes. I could see and feel the music. That feeling was seriously the most awe inspiring feeling that I had ever felt. I played multiple songs for fifteen minutes straight, which to me then felt like forever, when I noticed Z behind me laughing his ass at how high I was and recording me with his phone. He loves messing around on my keyboard sober so I asked him if he's ever played high. He took over and began to play. It wasn't any real songs but to us it was the voices of angels singing in our ears. I lied down on the floor and enjoyed it thinking, this is the best time of my life. Contempt with everything I wished I could had stayed there forever. Although, our piano play came to an end sadly. But we moved into the upstairs game room where I have a large Bose sound system I just couldn't resist. I plugged up my phone, opened Spotify, and cranked it up. I believe the song we played was Holiest by Glass Animals. It felt like I was at the concert. I was completely lost in the music and enjoying it when suddenly my logic kicked in. It's 11:00 and the neighbors have kids. If they call on a noise complaint, It probably wouldn't end well. So I stopped the music and finally grabbed my laptop. ~11:something We were back downstairs. I set up my laptop to the TV and afterward rewarded myself because I was amazed that I could do such a thing.(I'm pretty tech savvy and know more about computers and stuff than the average computer user so I don't know why I was so surprised by me plugging an HDMI cable into my laptop and being able to see it on the TV screen). By now I was still tripping but not nearly as bad as before. I'd say I had dropped to a [6-7]. We enjoyed the rest of the night watching some Lucas Bros and eating chips and snickers then crashed upstairs on the couches. In the morning I got up at 6:30, shaved, showered, and even cooked some sausage that we both ate before we left for school. I gotta say I expected more of a hangover but I was surprisingly productive. Anyways, that's the story of how I experienced my first real trip. It was fantastic, and wouldn't have been that great if it weren't for Z to be there with me the whole time. Thank you for reading if you did, please tell me if you enjoyed it or if you have any similar or bizarre experiences when reaching a new high.Summary:
Summarize: Greetings Redditors! First time posting and long time lurker. My husband and I adopted a couple of kittens off of Reddit a few months ago. These cats are awesome, but they do a couple of really odd things... Circe, the female, will not let me poop in peace! Every time I sit on the toilet, she opens the bathroom door (master pick locker!) and demands to sit in my lap then crawls her way to sit on my shoulders. If I deny her, she will claw her way to the top of my shoulders! When she gets to the top, she just lies still and becomes a purr monster! Awkward but sweet. Baltar (this is when things get weird) likes to suck his own nipples. Their mom died right after giving birth and I know this is a natural reaction. However, it does not really bother anyone until his sister starts sucking on his nips with him and he... well, he..... he cups and grabs his balls while he is doing it. To say the least, my husband gets pissed when he wakes up at 3A.M. to hear the cats doing some Lannister type activities (for all of my fellow Game of Throne nerds).Summary:
Summarize: Okay well in pretty sure literally no one but you took it as a 'joke'. How was it even a joke though? You didn't understand the reference, someone told you the wrong thing and it seemed like you thought he was right... Where is the joke there? Seriously? Other than the fact that it turns out you know he was wrong, which really isn't that funny because obviously people aren't going to think 'oh he's given credit to someone who told him the wrong thing, he must be kidding because no one ever believes people who lie to them about something they stated they aren't sure about.'.Summary:
Summarize: This same situation happened to my buddy and I except with the opposite end result. We had been trying to meet to set up camp up near the airfield after i lost my character a while back. When we finally met, my friend decided to scout out the hill we were near. Unfortunately a survivor with a Winchester was waiting for him and I at the top. He popped my friend after my buddy managed to spray him with a clip, but it was too late when I shot, he had already logged out. I searched the rest of the area to make sure he had no allies waiting to ambush me and found no one. I was then going to set up camp nearby to put my buddies gear in the tent, when I got popped in the back of the head. Needless to say I was pretty pissed. Alt-F4'ers really make me mad, granted that that is how I was killed the first time.Summary:
Summarize: I'm so bummed I missed the beginning of this thread because this will certainly be buried. BUT- I worked as a Girl Scout camp counselor for three years. A lot of crazy shit happened, including a camper being sent home for pulling a knife on the rest of the unit, but my favorite was the summer we were besieged by bears. This family of bears just decided they didn't give a fuck and started brazenly traipsing through the tent units to get to the dumpster behind the kitchen. They also clawed in the screen window in one of the cabins. At one point a bear showed up outside the dining hall window in broad daylight, in full view of all the campers. My group happened to be stationed in the tent unit they passed through every night, so we kept having to sleep in the dining hall or squeeze into a cabin with another group. Finally the dumpster was moved and the bears went away, but the girls were still nervous about sleeping in the unit. We (the counselors) decided the best way to deal with their fear was to work them into a blood frenzy. We had 20 twelve year old girls dancing around a campfire with mud on their faces singing about bringing the head of the bear back on a pike. One girl ran off and pissed in the treehouse to 'mark our territory.' We slept in the unit that night, and the counselors were all pretty on edge despite all our bravado. We had pots and pans next to our beds ready to start clankin' at the first sign of bear activity. Then, around midnight, we heard something big walking through the campsite. THIS IS IT, we thought. We all sprang upright in bed, whaling on that crockery like our lives and the lives of 20 minors depended on it and screaming the Little Red Wagon song at the top of our lungs. Turned out we just scared the shit out of a camper who got up to use the bathroom. But we felt like HEROES, dammit.Summary:
Summarize: First off I would like to preface this with I had a horrible day today and have ingested a bit of alcohol so I apologize for any spelling/writing errors. Now onto the problem, but first a little back story. I have been in a relationship since September 2011. My first real relationship since I found out my fiance cheated on me and we broke things off in 2008. I went through a period of ONS (one night stands) and 3 month relationships. I met my current girlfriend and went out with her a year before we started dating. We met online through a personals website and went out on a date. After that I kept trying to set up a second but she never had time due to various reasons. I eventually said fuck it and moved on. One day after drill night at the firehouse we went to our usual hangout and grabbed a bite to eat and she showed up with a few friends from work. We both saw each other but I didn't say anything to her because I was pissed. I thought she was just making excuses to not go out again. I leaned over to the guys at the table, pointed her out, and said something along the lines of "That's the bitch that keeps blowing me off" after that we finished eating and left. A year later I post an ad on Craigslist and she responds. By that point I vaguely remember going out with her since I have continued back on my ONS and short term dating path. Needless to say we have been dating steadily since September 2011 even though our first date was a year beforehand. If you have read this far I appreciate it and now will get to the issue. I was laid off after 3 years of steady work and had to move back home. Since then I have bounced from job to job. It has been that way since we have been dating. Now I am a volunteer firefighter/ EMT so that can seem like a full time job at times. It is surprising how hard it is to find someone that is ok with you running out at dinner or the middle of the night or holidays with family. She has been at the same place since we've started steadily going out. She makes decent money but hates her job. I currently work at a seasonal position at a major hardware store and am making decent money as well. (highest paying job I've had) She has moved in with me into my parents house for the past year due to her mother being a lazy fat witch but that's a story for another day. Quick example is that my girlfriend is a horrible daughter and piece of shit because she will not go to the gas station and pick her mother up cigarettes and junk food to stuff her face with at 9'o clock at night because she has eaten herself into a wheelchair bound existence and gets winded walking 10 feet. That's after my girlfriend has worked a 10 hour shift and been up since 5 in the morning. But I digress the current situation is as follows. We rarely spend time at the house. Essentially we get home and sleep. My mother can be very trying at times as mothers are. Always asking questions etc... I love my mother and father to death. They have stood by me my whole life through very hard times. I have not been the ideal son in laymen terms. When ever I have needed help they were there. THE PROBLEM: My girlfriend wants to move out and get an apartment. Issues: >1. We have a very limited selection of places due to me being in the FD. I could quit and move anywhere but I would be giving up 75% of who I've become and my being. I have doubts after shitty calls but then there are calls where you come back and realize you wouldn't trade it for anything. It's a feeling you won't understand unless you are in it. >2. We can afford a studio apartment for $650 a month but it is the size of our current bedroom. Essentially our bed would leave a 2 foot path around the main part and we would have a small kitchen and small closet. >3. My parents are retiring within a year or so and I will be taking over the house when they leave for warm weather during the winter months. I predict they will be taking a few weeks off this coming winter to look at places. >4. I can almost 80% guarantee they will be leaving the house to me. >5. I just don't get spending almost $1000 a month total for a place that all we do is sleep in when we have a place free. At this point I am looking for another job seeing as my current job is questionable as to how long I will be kept on due to the season winding down. I know at least through July 4th. That is the other issue. Yes for now we can scrape by and afford the place but what happens when I get laid off or take a steady job at a pay cut or hour cut? That is our major thing we fight about. Housing and money. If those were taken care of through magic we would have a perfect or near perfect relationship. We have not had a major fight on any other issues. But ever since this issue has arisen We have fought to the point I have wanted to call it quits and start over with another woman. There is a girl at work that flirts with me quite strongly but I am not a cheater. I have been the other man and cheated on but never the cheater. It's just not something I do.Summary:
Summarize: How the fuck are people upvoting this? Drivers are part of the OS and android is linux based. Why do servers use linux? Because it doesn't need to reboot for updates (like windows). In addition, do you have problems if you take your trusty usb sticks and put them in your pc? It's the same thing, if you buy cheap shit off ebay you're going to have components that fail but surely the important ones will get to be implemented in their android (don't look at me like that, every single phone company has its own modified version of android, it's not a big deal to get the drivers in there). I'll give you that it's not going to be like arranging magnets on a fridge as a battery needs different connectors than a camera, but you don't need more pins between a 2mp camera and a 10 mp camera, especially not if you just upgrade the size of the lens. This would definitely work with some clever engineering. CPU's don't get smaller or larger, you will have a spot for the cpu. Doesn't matter if it's single or eight-core. Same goes for RAM. Then you'll have the battery in a place where you can extend it at the sacrifice of some other components and the rest will just be standard i/o.Summary:
Summarize: Story time! So a little backstory; I had boxed at an amateur level for roughly four years at the time of this happening, this included competing at a national level so to say I was quite skilled in the pugilistic arts would be accurate. Edit: decided to add more about me and the guy Me: 4 years of boxing at the time. 160lbs 5'10, don't know about body fat or anything but I always had a six pack so I wasn't fat. Him: don't think he had any experience in combat sports or martial arts or what have you, but he played rugby and probably outweighed me by about 30lbs at the minimum with a typical rugby player body I.e. Very thick and dense but a bit on the soft bellied side, probably an inch or two taller than me. So i was at a house party which included about 30% I already knew and the rest being made up of friends of friends, everyone was having a good time. I was stood outside the house with a group of about 5/6 guys including myself, and as guys often do when having drinks there was some friendly back and forth, banter if you will, and it would seem one fella couldn't take a joke. I don't remember specifically what it was he had said but I remember that I replied with 'nah shut the fuck up' which got a few laughs from the other guys in the group, I was stood with the guy I replied to to my right about two feet away, and out of the corner of my vision I saw he take a swing at me catching me in the mouth. I instinctively shifted my right foot back and dropped my bottle going into my boxing stance, he threw another sloppy haymaker which I rolled (ducked) under, I started throwing back straight shots in combinations, just simple stuff double jab-right straight-leading to a lead hook basic shit, and by doing this I quickly drove him back to the wall of the house. This was basically my tactic for actual matches; drive them back to the ropes and work the body and head, and this is what happened then I only threw a couple of big shots before my friends pulled me away but as soon as I stopped hitting him the dude started talking shit again which I'll admit was very annoying. We left soon after and I heard from one of my friends who was on a rugby team with this guy that when he saw him a couple of days later he still had a bruised face and split lip, the worst injury I gained from this encounter was a minor welt on the inside of my lip were it hit my teeth mid sentence, along with some sore hands.Summary:
Summarize: I'm in Wellington (where the qualifying game was) right now, and I have to say that it's not "batshit insane" at all. There's waaaay more interest in the fucking santa parade at 2pm than some soccer team....and there's a wine festival on, so most people are at that. The one soccer thing I saw on my way to work, was a bar with a chalkboard outfront which read "congrats to all whites", but that might just be some white supremacist shit....Summary:
Summarize: My friend describes her sexuality as "whatever." If you ask her what that means she'll say "whatever you are, if you sit on my face I'll like it"Summary:
Summarize: I was 8(ish). A bunch of guys were teasing my friend and I on our way home from school the day before. They didn't even know us, they were just being mean, throwing stones etc. One of them called us bitches. When the principal asked about it the next day he asked me what they said and if they called us names. I said one called us the b-word. The principal told me to use the actual word. I'd never said that word in my life! That was the scariest part. I felt so naughty just for saying it! (I'm 22 now and still don't swear often - even typing it feels kind of weird...)Summary:
Summarize: So my parents moved to Hawaii for 2 years for a job, and wanted someone to watch over their house. It just so happened that my friend wanted to get out of the state she was living in for most of her life, so I gave her the opportunity to move up to the lovely pacific northwest and rent out my parent's home (and the home I grew up in) for real cheap (200 a month, pretty bitchin deal right???) Now I know that my friend is a bit controlling, over emotional and moody as hell but I figure we can work through it and she can respect living in my home. This puts me in an awkward position because I have to play landlord to my friend. As soon as she gets here she starts arguing with me about how we're going to decorate the living room. She demands that she wants it to feel like home and not like she's away, I had to tell her that it was my living room too and she got all pissy. She gets angry when I spend time with my boyfriend. We got in another argument because of this, and she said that it was my responsibility to keep her company and entertained. As if she's still visiting or something. I let her know that I'm not going to put off my life because of her, and that if I did spend as much time home as she wanted me to, she would get sick of me. And low and behold, the weekends I stay home she starts being a bitch because she's sick of looking at me. At this point, I don't feel comfortable in my own home. I wake up, go to work or school, go to my boyfriends to spend a couple hours, and come home and hang out with her. But as soon as I walk through the door you can cut the air with a knife. It's like she's angry because I'm living my own life. She threatens to move back to her home state. I don't say anything to her because I don't really know why it's a threat. If she doesn't want to be here, then by all means quit torturing me and leave!!! I go out with her on weekends. I introduced her to my friends and even go and pick her up so she can chill with us and she's not stuck at the house. Just tonight when I got home from work and my boyfriends, she was in a pissy mood. The light in my bedroom burnt out the other day and so I ask her if she minds if i turn the light on in the living room (she's in there watching hulu on the computer). She huffs and puffs and ask me why I need to turn the light on, I say because it's dark in here and I need to do some work. She snaps back with, I HAVE A HEADACHE! So I say, um, okay and go back into my room and turn on the closet light to work by. She get's up, says, FINE YOU CAN HAVE YOUR LIGHT ON! and slams the door to her room. Any ideas on what to tell her? I guess I know what to say, but how do I approach her? This technically is my house while my parents are away and if she's going to continue to treat me like this would it be wrong to ask her to leave? EDIT: To make things clear, there is no written lease, only a verbal agreement and month to month rent. EDIT II: We just "talked." She started crying and playing victim. I told her that she needs to quit treating me like shit and quit making me feel unwelcome in my home. She says that I'm not "home enough" to make me feel "unwelcome..." but then goes on to explain how I come home at night, am home in the morning, and hang out with her on weekends. I think she's a little delusional. I told her if she didn't want to be here then she should move back to her home and she says that she "couldn't." She says she doesn't "have the money." The IRS is fucking her for not claiming her per cap (why the fuck she tried to pull on on the IRS, I don't know. This is the kind of person I'm dealing with.) and she still hasn't found a job despite being here for a month. Why? Because she's being picky. She doesn't even have a high school degree and she's trying to be picky. I can understand that she's getting cabin fever but, I'm done playing nice. EDIT III deleted the stuff about my light bulb because some of you are just as annoying and nitpicky as my roommate.Summary:
Summarize: This is mostly a rant, but I would appreciate any input, advice, or general observations about the situation. During a recent visit to her school's open house/freshmen orientation, my sister managed to describe several people as "creepy". First, we were swimming in our hotel's pool. We were the only two people in the pool, though there were two other women sunning themselves next to it, when a fat bald man walked into the pool area. My sister shot me a look, which I interpreted as "Oh well, it was fun to have the pool to ourselves for a while." I shrugged and we continued to bob up and down in the water, gossiping and comparing our complexions. The man who'd just entered took off his shoes and shirt, put on a pair of goggles, and proceeded to swim up and down the length of the pool. We'd been in the pool for maybe an hour anyways, so when my sister said she wanted to leave I figured she was just done with the water. But as we were walking back to our room she says, "Can you believe how creepy that guy was?" No, I could not believe his creepiness, because I hadn't noticed it, he was just using the pool (just like us!). "But Moxiecontin, he was a fat bald guy, and he was wearing goggles ! That's so creepy!" She giggled and I made some faces but did not continue the conversation, I wanted this to be a fun trip with no drama (and she's 18, she hasn't quite mastered thinking before she speaks). But then we were at a restaurant for dinner, and she feels the need to point out a man sitting by himself at the bar. "Look at that guy" she says, "So creepy! Who sits by themselves at the bar?" I shushed her (didn't want him to hear her!), and theorized that maybe he was hungry and didn't want to take up a whole table or booth. "Yeah, but only creepy people have to eat at restaurants alone , he should just by some ramen." I asked her if she would rather be eating ramen than the (fairly) tasty mexican food we were enjoying, and she just stuck her tongue out at me and the conversation moved on. At about 11pm that night we were hitting the hotel's vending machines, filling up on snacks and soda, when a man walked past the alcove where the machines are. I caught his eye over the pile of soda cans in my arms and he greeted us, while he continued walking, with a "How y'all doing tonight?" "Doin' great!" I replied, brandishing my sugary treasure at him, "Aw, that's nice" he said, never having stopped walking or saying anything bad. My sister turns to me and says, "Holy shit that was so fucking creepy!" Now, this was not a creepy exchange. We live in the south, where if you make unexpected eye contact with someone it's okay (and often demanded) that you politely acknowledge it. I told her that there was nothing "creepy" about that, he was just saying hello. He didn't even stop! But I was wrong, he was creepy because he was wearing a striped tank top and shorts that showed his knees. So in the course of five hours she'd picked out three strangers and gone into detail about why they were creepy. Of course, the next morning it starts again. The man using the waffle machine before us? "Whoa, creepy". I didn't even bother with that one, but I think he could hear her. But then a new development! Women can be creepy too! While I checked us out she stood outside next to the cigarette butt dispenser puffing away on her new bad habit, and another woman came outside and did the same thing. She was middle-aged and thin, and I said hello to her as I collected my sister and headed to the car. "That old lady was creepy" she says once she closes her door. "Why, did she say something to you?" "No, she just stood there and smoked" EXACTLY LIKE YOU WERE?! I pointed that out, and she laughed and said, "Yeah, but I'm not like that." Once at the school she used the word several more times, usually to describe why she didn't want to sit in a particular area during the presentations. "No, that guy looks creepy" "No! That girl's got a wolf on her shirt, she's fucking creepy " "Oh god, that guy's dad is wearing overalls, what a creepy family, we can't sit next to them!" I just tuned it out. On the drive home she even called a passenger in another car creepy! Besides her labeling of other people as "creepy", we had a great time. I generally enjoy her company, and she's a very bright girl with an awesome future ahead of her. She received a "full ride" to the fantastic private university of her choice, and she's talented beyond belief! She has a large group of friends, and a smaller group of really great friends, and things just generally seem perfect for her. But I'm worried that her quickness to put strangers down is going to hurt her in the future, especially starting school without anyone she knows going with her. I'm also starting to think of her as annoying, and I don't want to think badly of my own sister.Summary:
Summarize: You can definitely prove asbestos is healthy (I'm only going to pick on this because we just covered it in Env Chem). Basically asbestos fibres remain in the lungs for a long time. When a number of people who used to work under similar conditions develop similar symptoms and eventually die of similar causes, AND you perform an autopsy and find fibres there, well, it doesn't take a genius to figure this out. I believe asbestos as a directly harmful substance is only one of two supreme court judgements that actually ruled in favour of the defendant. Asbestos acts as a mutagen btw. It basically creates micro cancers at the points of contact. The body can deal with one fibre, but it becomes problematic when the person in question sleeps on the stuff (certain ships used to have hammocks/bedding made of it) or breathes it in daily (workmen). While I do not know about your personal situation, it is possible that you were genetically predisposed towards having shitty lungs, with tobacco smoke/ other factors, only serving to accelerate it. There is no smoking inside buildings in the EU. Most public buildings are also designating a smoking area away from the doorways. I believe this is a pretty civic option. If I'm smoking as I walk down a road, you will only be in contact with my smoke for the same amount of time I'll be in contact with your body odour. If I'm smoking at a bus shelter, I will move a reasonable distance to respect the possibility that it might annoy you. If you ask me (or any other smoker) to please move, most of us would apologise (even though there's nothing to apologise for), and move without question.Summary:

Summarize: Wow holy shit those bad guys are doing a pretty terrible job at pretending to get hit. The last two hits in particular are just not even close to landing. Then there's the dude that gets hit by the tv, and proceeds to raise his head up, then go back down then repeats that process until he needs to start fighting again, at which point he goes from unable to sit up to full steam fighting in like 2 seconds flat.Summary:
Summarize: So yesterday i went to a huge house party with a few friends, we arrived at like 1 a.m so many people were already wasted, and there was this guy in particular who was wasted af, there were people taking selfies with the guy and all,nobody was helping him, so me and a few others decided to call his dad to pick him up(It was the right thing to do, since this guy was SERIOUSLY wasted) we picked him up and went outside to wait for his dad, after his dad picked him up and we all went inside this girl started talking to me, she was telling me that it was great that we helped a guy who we didn't even knew, so she added me on FB, Kik etc.Summary:

Summarize: This is a long story, so bear with me. I really, desperately need advice. Also, we've been dating for about one year . For the past couple of weeks, our otherwise solid relationship has been extremely rocky. She's been super busy, was calling/texting me a lot less than usual. Emotions were on high because we're both so stressed from school and got into a tiff about how we never see each other. Last night I tried making amends with her, so I stayed the night at her place. She wouldn't let me kiss her stomach or do anything sexual. I thought it was because she was feeling self-conscious (a common occurrence).She fell asleep first, and I ended up fiddling with her phone trying to get her noise generator app to work to help me sleep. While on her phone, I got curious and went into her text messages. I know I shouldn't have been snooping but I thought I might find out the real reason that she had been so distant to me. While on her phone, I found a text to her friend about a dream she had where she dumped me for some other guy. Her friend suggested it was a premonition, and my gf replied "I wishhh." I ended up leaving her apartment without waking her up because I was so mad and hurt that she wanted to be with someone else (a close friend of hers...not just some stranger crush). This discovery plus the way she was snapping at me earlier in the night, I drove back to my apartment. Two hours later, I get a call from her. I ask her to explain herself, being as calm as possible. Essentially, she broke down discussing how she was afraid of what would happen to us when we both graduate and potentially end up in different states. I could tell she was holding something back so I pressed her. She then admitted to me that she cuts and is suicidal That was why she didn't want me to kiss her stomach or take her shirt off. She was hiding her cut marks. Apparently she used to cut in high school, stopped for a while when we started dating, but recently she started doing again (last December for a bit and again in the past few weeks). She doesn't deal with stress very well and gets easily overwhelmed. Her major doesn't help at all because she is constantly being judged/and is super busy. After she admitted, I drove back to her apartment, because I was scared for her. And I wanted to keep talking. I told her that needs to be honest with me. This ended up in her revealing every major lie she's ever told me. About cutting , about this friend that she has a crush on (turns out its pretty serious and stems from right before we started dating...she constantly talks to her other friend about she has a crush), how she lied about smoking pot (trite compared to the others but still a turn off and still the lies hurt me). On top of this, she said that seeing me once a week is enough for her (regardless of her busy schedule) but it isn't for me. Also, she revealed that she doesn't want to have sex anymore because she is paranoid about possible repercussions (baby, STD [we're exclusive afaik], etc) and how livid her parents would be if they need she had premarital sex (they are generally pretty controlling and she can never shake them loose...they have financial holds...as well as emotional). This a huge dealbreaker for me as I'm a pretty sexual person. Plus it's irrational because we use condoms, she just started taking birth control, and I pull out. So pretty much no chance of having a baby. All of these lies on top of the emotional strife of finding out about her self-harming behavior are just weighing down on me. I feel like i'm going to have a break down. I love my girlfriend and want to help her but I don't know how. It'd be one thing if I ONLY found out about the cutting...but I don't know if she even really wants to be with me and not some other guy. What do I do? Should I stay with her and help her through this? I feel like we need a break. Some time to think, figure ourselves out, and her get professional help (I implored to talk to a counselor immediately and set up an appointment). But again, I don't want to leave her at such an emotional time. I really do love her and want her to get healthy but in the mean time what do I do?Summary:
Summarize: You're looking at a very rare case within capitalism. Bill Gates just so happens to be a very generous and caring individual. The vast majority of successful capitalists do not share his philanthropic tendencies (I'm not talking about his donations to various causes, although that does speak volumes for his character). The fact that he brought computers to everyone had nothing to do with him. That was a market that was going to happen with or without a monopoly on operating systems. If anything, come late 90s, the existence of Microsoft was inhibiting a lot of new development. Very few An-Caps seem to realize that Microsoft was charged under anti-trust laws at that time, even though they weren't really doing anything evil with their monopoly. Just the fact that they were one was reason enough to break them up and supply Cisco, Apple, and Linux with huge subsidies for development, largely at the cost of Microsoft. We should count ourselves lucky that a man like Bill Gates was in charge of such power. Unfortunately, he's only one in a sea of sociopathic CEOs that care nothing about the market, nothing about their workers, nothing about their customers, only what they can get out of all them for personal gain.Summary:
Summarize: I didn't think it was a waste of money. I don't agree with everything in his book, but I think it's decent. I'm running the program right now, or did day 1 at least. I'm a full time student so I don't have 2-3 hours to spend in the gym. I need to go in, do shit, and get out. I used to spend 2-3 hours cause my volume was so high (pro- I developed high work capacity and can handle a ton of volume and still recover) so this program was different. I got in, lifted, got out in under 50 mins. I'd say if you don't want to look like a bottom heavy person, e.g. those coming off of SS, then pick this up. It's a nice change of pace. I'm modifying the program by adding more sets and reps, as well as some more accessory work (bodybuilder type stuff).Summary:
Summarize: Tested this with a friend. Left him at ten health and he had an ancient watcher on the board. My board consisted of 2 and 1 attack creatures with a 5 attack leper gnome. I then equipped a truesilver (to add to the animation time.) I sent truesilver to the watcher and everything else to face. I sent all minions to face, and leper gnome went last. When i was unable to make any more moves since i had won the game, I conceded. The enemy hero exploded before the leper gnome attacked thanks to the new concede buff.Summary:
Summarize: Bro, I feel thy pain. All my lifting life I've had an easily impinged right shoulder, which no amount of prehab could fix. A month ago, it went away; easily, with no additional intervention. I was ecstatic. But then, the terror began again. Day by day, rep by rep, I developed the mirror opposite weakness in my left shoulder. I was tearing my hair out. I didn't know hwat do; I thought this was going to be the year where I finally brought my bench up to be proportional to my deadlift and squat, but no! As it was offered so it was snatched away. I couldn't sleep. Sleep... SLEEP! That was it! I realised that the change I had made just over a month ago was moving my bed, causing my to sleep on my left side instead of my right. The damage was done by my muscles relaxing in the night, and putting my shoulder in a position that promoted weakness during lifts. Since then I have slept on my back. And little by little, my shoulders have balanced. And now, rep by rep, I will become truly stronk.Summary:
Summarize: Two years ago, I was hanging out with a friend at uni, waiting with him for his dad to pick him up. His dad and brother roll up to us, and ask us if we wanted to go to the casino with them (Mind you, I was 18, as was his brother, and he was 20). We decided to go, because fuck it, what else is there to do? We drive about an hour or so, smoke a couple of joints on the way, and all is going well. We got the casino and started walking around. I figured we were just going to hang out and sight see since we were not of age to gamble. Well, this was not the case. While I had no money on me, my friend did, and he got some chips to play with. He gave me a $25 chip, and we proceed to sit at a $10 blackjack table, high as shit. Now, mind you, I was pretty scared that someone was going to ask us for I.D. as soon as we entered the gambling area. However, we got through and sat down with no problem. After a few hours, I had turned my $25 chip into a pocketful of chips, about $275. We left that table, and went to the higher stakes tables, with $50 betting minimums. I broke even, my friend and his brother were up to about $500 at this point. We go to another table, and boy was that a good choice. We ended up sitting with several other folks, one of whom apparently really knew what he was doing, as he was telling everyone when to hit and when to bust, since it would benefit us all. I'd say about 85% of the time he was correct. This dude helped me more than double my money. At this point, it was about 5 a.m. We decided to collect our money and cash out. I was worried they would ask us for I.D. here, but again, nothing. We cashed out our chips, totaling a little over $2000, and left. Needless to say, I was psyched, I had $650 in my pocket after going with absolutely nothing, and we had a blast. My friend had left with $1100, and his brother had $440. Feels good, man.Summary:
Summarize: Hi all, Throwaway here (24 m); I've poked around the FAQs and have done a little searching and have found some genuinely insightful information. However, my searching skills aren't up to par or my patience ran out too soon; I didn't see any threads that dealt specifically with a dilemma I'm having. I'm truly sorry if I'm beating another tired topic to death with this post; if I am, could you please point me in the right direction to a thread that could help me out. I've been seeing this girl (22) for 2-3 weeks now. She is really into me and I dig her personality because I can relate to her and be myself around her, a luxury that I really haven't had before. I don't think right now that the feelings are completely mutual, but given some time I think we might make a good couple. The first time we'd made out I spent a lot of time kissing the nape of her neck when I found out that was a big turn on for her. She didn't exactly taste very fresh; I chalked it up to a long day including her bicycle ride to work/class, nutted up, and continued with the activity. It wasn't the most pleasant thing to me, but I enjoyed making her feel good. I forget the timeline, but either a few days after or before we had a conversation where she'd mentioned in passing that taking a shower wasn't always a necessary thing for her to go out. I don't consider her dirty, per se, but as someone who won't leave the house without a shower fresh shirt/underwear/socks, it was a slight turn-off. Last night I slept over for the 2nd time; she's been really eager to please me, although she would only give me head while I wore a condom. I guess I'm a bit old fashioned and don't want to rush things, and we haven't gone to get tested, so I let it slide. I didn't make a big deal about it and let her go down on me after suiting up. To be honest, it wasn't pleasurable, she said my penis was too large and didn't fit in her mouth - her teeth were constantly scraping along my shaft and we called it quits in regards to fellatio after a short period. I've had really good head before - without condoms - but I have no idea where to begin giving advice as I've never sucked a dick. Consider this topic B, of lesser importance. I truly appreciated her enthusiasm and her eagerness to please me. We started kissing again and I continued to rub her clit with my fingers and could feel that she was wet. I offered to go down on her (I did not tell her that I have never done it before) and she obliged pending a quick trip to the bathroom. After the bathroom break was over we resumed our activities and I made my way down to do the deed. I spread her legs and went to town. While I was new to using my mouth, I'm not unfamiliar with the anatomy and she really enjoyed the couple minutes of attention I gave her before she asked me to stop. She said nobody had ever gone down on her before and it made me really happy to know that I was able to provide her pleasure in such a fashion. The problem was that her odor and taste were revolting. While I hadn't given oral before, I have tasted other partners' juices while licking my fingers for a bit more lubrication, and they were nothing like what I tasted last night. Looking back now, I realize that she had just used the bathroom and she probably didn't take a washcloth to the area in question after urinating. At the time, I did notice a taste of urine (which should have been a warning sign) but I kept going. At the same time though, I wonder how much of the bad taste might have been due to her just not washing that area as rigourously or regularly as one should in the shower. While I keep my scrotum and perineum shaved and the groin trimmed, she is completely unshaven; she mentioned to me that she could 'take care of that' but not knowing what to say, I replied that she should do whatever makes her feel more comfortable. So topic A, of greater priority, is how do I confront her about the horrible taste I experienced while going down on her. In [this thread]( the descriptions provided for a healthy partner match what I have experienced previously: a somewhat-neutral taste that can even be pleasant if you are compatible partners. Her smell and taste was just putrid, but I feel I'm going to hurt her feelings and make her more self-conscious than she already is about her body if I don't bring it up in the right, sensitive manner. From what I read, it seems that trimming is the best option to cut down on body-odor, should I recommend this to her. So, /r/sex, thank you for sticking with me in this extremely long post. Perhaps it was just a fluke due to her recently using the restroom, next time I will do a taste test before committing to going down. Just not sure what to do. I feel like I should recommend that we both shower together next time before fooling around, but as she has 4-5 other female roommates, this might not be the best option. Furthermore, I don't really want to have to hop in the shower just so that I can enjoy our time together.Summary:
Summarize: I've been always a lonely guy, this year I decided to change this and actually apply some of the stuff I've been reading on the internet since around 2009 about meeting women. So I went to a party back in April and met this girl, I started messaging her right the next day and eventually we went out on a date. Parallel to this I still went to parties in order to get new experiences. When I met her she assumed I was this player who had a crazy sex life and multiple partners at once, which couldn't be further from the truth, yes I went out with multiple girls at once and she knew it, but I never had sex with any of them, this part she wasn't aware off, I played along with her player image she had of me, in retrospect it was a mistake from my part. Here's the thing, she was too inquisitive about my past, other girls didn't even ask half of what this girl asked, and of course, stupid me, played along with the whole player mentality. Then a couple of weeks ago I felt bad about this whole player image I created and decided to tell her about it. Now, here's the catch, I knew she hated lies, who doesn't right? But I feel her hatred towards lies was a little bit over the top considering our relantionship status, e.g. I once "lied" about not talking during sex and after that I told her the "truth", that I actually do talk during sex, she FLIPPED OUT, I almost lost her. Anyway, after I opened up with her and told her that I'm not this player guy and actually lost my virginity with her, which is true, she told me she felt like she has been living a lie for the last 5 months and to a certain extend I agree, I should have been honest with her since the beginning, but it was the whole player image which allowed me, in the first place, to meet her. Then the week after I mentioned some of her weird quirks to my colleagues at college, they aren't really my friends. She found out after using my cellphone to talk to them, yes, I allowed it. She also used my facebook to talk to girls I've gone out with to make sure I didn't have sex with them, again, yes, I allowed it. Thinking back now I shouldn't have allowed it, my words should have been enough for her. That's my part of the history where I fucked up. Now for her part, I would appreciate if someone could give me some pointers if this is acceptable behaviour in a relationship, I personally feel she crossed my personal boundaries. She didn't like that I LIKE going to the gym. She said she didn't care that I went, but the fact that I LIKE going there, makes her feel as she is competing with the gym for my attention. She was jealous of my third grade "girlfriends", shit, I never even kissed them I was a kid. This was 16 years ago and she tells me she feels jealously when I talk about it. She told me she secretly wished that I grew tired of the gym so she could be the only thing that mattered to me. She once tested me with this gym thing saying that if I didn't let go of it I wouldn't get any sex from her. She needed constant reassurance that she was hot/pretty/sexy, EVEN THOUGH she never told me those things, from her perspective I have a superioty complex and calling me handsome/sexy would be bad for me. When we fought, she would tell me that I wasn't the best dude avaiable for her, there were others who were less juvenile. She would also stress that she could get ANY guy SHE wants, followed by "...and I don't even think highly of myself, I'm humble!" I once told her I accepted a cookie from a girl in class. She asked me if the girl offered the cookie only for me, as if offering a cookie is codename for fuck me. I once looked at a girl walking down the street, shit, I just looked, didn't even make eye contact. She later told me she found a guy, looked him in the eyes and bit her lips, in order to get a reaction from him as revenge. I feel she's really manipulative and to a certain extend, evil. I suggested her she seeked a therapist (I do therapy and it's helping me) but from her point of view she doesn't need it. Another curious thing is that we were only boyfriend and girlfriend for a month or so, but she didn't consider me her boyfriend, she would tell me that I was practically her boyfriend or just "boyfriend" (yes, with " ") and after the brake up she told me that I was her boyfriend. WTF? I'm aware that what I did wasn't right and I don't plan on doing it again, but I feel like that if she didn't ask soooo much stuff about my past and focused more on me being with her, things would probably be a lot better. Shit, I wasn't even her boyfriend when I told her most of my "past", why did she need so many details? I personally didn't care about her past boyfriends and what she did in the past, I just enjoyed her being with me at that moment. Thats about it. I'm still feeling sad about the brake up, probably because I'm all alone now, again. I guess the solution is to go out, meet girls, be 100% honest with them (no more lying about sex and stuff), filter the crazy ones and enjoy the others. I just need some exterior points of views, how bad did I fuck up? Was her attitude acceptable? What red flags should I look out for in next relationships? I need some pointers on this whole relationship dynamics as I'm pretty new to it!Summary:
Summarize: I'll try to keep this short because I'm so beside myself. And, just, incoming. Pity party/woe is me/angst/nobody loves me/horrible person with horrible thoughts bullshit incoming... I've been dating my boyfriend (27/M) for close to two years. We've been living together since June of last year due to individual circumstances that lead up to that decision. No one needs to tell me that was a bad idea, as I'm reaping the repercussions. Not even a year after we started dating, because of being overworked and just plain lazy, my boyfriend ignored me for an entire six months and masturbated in secret. Leaving me to wonder why he wouldn't come to bed, why our sex life tanked, why nothing I was doing was turning him on or getting him interested in me. Sex, to me, is important, I love to bond, I love to make my partner feel good, and I would hope they would do the same for me. My boyfriend is very much more of a quality time person, gets his intimacy from day to day pleasantries, eating dinner together, etc. He was getting his needs met during this six month period and, I guess, just never thought to give a shit about me. This whole situation has turned me into a fucking monster. I am sad and angry all the time. I've been very depressed because I just feel fat, ugly, stupid for ever believing him when he said he loved me, and just "less than". Until very recently, I had a serious addiction to alcohol, that sent me to the hospital once, unbeknownst to him. We're in therapy, he recognizes why he did was wrong, and why, he knows he's screwed this relationship up almost irreparably, and I'm trying to work with him and trying to learn to forgive. But, last night, I almost lost it on him. I noticed when we came home from therapy yesterday that his mood tanked. I asked him what was wrong, and he said that he wasn't sure if I'd be sticking around to fix this with him, and ever marry him, because that's what he ultimately wanted out of our relationship. He later admitted he just wanted me to tell him everything would okay. That is what I should have said, 100%. Instead, I dodged his feelings and went on a diatribe about how I didn't have a timeline on forgiving him, that I was seriously, deeply hurt still, and didn't think six months was ample time to get over it, considering I've just only recently decided to get a handle on my health in an attempt to improve my self-esteem. He immediately got upset and yelled at me, "This is why I never fucking talk to you!" And turned his back to me (we were in bed). I kind of tried to keep my cool, but ultimately had an anxiety attack, and started defending myself. I basically retold the story of how he wasted six months of my life, cheated me out of a satisfying sex life because of his own selfishness and laziness. He told me I was turning the conversation away from him, making it all about me. I agreed, telling him it's rather hard to sympathize with someone who willingly ignores his girlfriend's needs because "I was tired, and pleasing another human being is too hard". Yes, he actually said that to me. He tells me two wrongs don't make a right, basically, that I can't suck him dry, and ask for all of this physical attention and yet make no attempt to meet his needs. He says our dynamic right now is unhealthy. I agreed, but, pointedly explained that I was justified, and not just doing it because "it's too hard/It's too much work". You know, I'm not a lazy asshole (or wasn't). I busted my ass and gave him way more than he ever deserves, and he took me for granted, and hell yeah, I'm fucking pissed. We ended the conversation without a resolution, and went to bed. But, holy fuck. I just want to strangle him. When he says things like this, it comes off as, "I apologized, started doing everything you asked,"(that he should have been doing in the first fucking place, but, I digress) "WHY WON'T YOU FORGIVE ME AND GET OVER IT???" I'm so out of my mind, confused, over all of this. I'm pissed that he's making such a big deal about me still being angry about being outright ignored because considering your SO's needs are "too hard", and I don't want him to have the security he previously had, because I feel he just wants something to abuse, again. When he told me that he felt I didn't love him anymore, I had to pause and redirect the focus of the conversation because, I honestly don't know anymore. I got burned, bad. I don't want to go through any of this ever again. He says he just feels like he's paying a debt, and nothing will get better, because it's been six months and I've still barely loosened up about it. I can't help but agree, part of me wants him to suffer what I suffered. Fuck him, right? But, logically, and on an empathetic note, it's 100% wrong to be like this with him. So I'm very lost, reddit. What do I do now? I want to work through this. How do I start to see him with at least a semblance of what I once did? How do I learn to respect him, again? How can I let go of all of this anger? I've gotten so bad since we started seeing our therapist, that she suggested I go on antidepressants because of how much more miserable I look every week. Every other aspect of my life is tied to this relationship. My job, my friends, things I value, and love, and want to be around to cherish. I used to have my boyfriend on that list, but now, every time we're in a room together... I don't know. I'm so tense, I feel like a burden, I feel like he'd be better off married to his hand, or someone he actually fucking loves, and treats them the way he should have been treating me. I'm so lost...Summary:
Summarize: Before anybody says he's "fine" or "overpowered" let's take a look at his statistics. Across the board Yasuo has a very low winrate of around 45-47 after the recent buff making him a better pick than urgot. But what makes him so weak? I feel its in the way riot designed him originally and changed his kit so dramatically. If anybody bothers to look at the history of yasuo you can easily see how much he has been gutted. Originally designed as a mid game carry he is now a lategame carry that is out scaled by yi and the likes. He was also originally designed as a mid laner but now his base stats are so low he can't even compete with many of them. Zed for example scale much better than yasuo with higher bade stats and a much stronger kit for teamfights while being just as mobile. While many can surely say yasuos wall and e are just as strong that's not true at all because of how squishy yasuo really is and how those skills have been so completely gutted since release. I understand my post isn't very coherent because I'm tired but I've really come to enjoy yasuo and I would like riot to give him a little more love than the community that hates him.Summary:
Summarize: I have a few, but not about me. A friend of mine had an internet relationship that ended bad because the other guy was diagnosed with HIV, and he thought it was better to stop the relationship as it was. Even though, they could never meet IRL during the few months they've been together. This same friend had another relationship, but that one ended up badly too. I actually ended up chatting through Skype with them, and, well, the guy fell in love with me instead of my friend. Things basically ended up the next day. Another friend of mine had one too, but it didn't end up well (because the guy was a complete asshole), he started talking bad about us, and my friend decided to cut the relationship down. This friend had another one, that ended up badly too, even though I don't know why or how. In either case, they couldn't meet up IRL, which can be a reason why it didn't last, I think.Summary:
Summarize: STORY TIME! A gf I had in high school was obsessed with GWAR. I was eh about them (not really my type - my Sansa was chock full of Guns 'n' Roses, Aerosmith, Metallica, and Weezer) but I saw a show was coming to town so I got her tickets. We got there early, to get a spot right up front ("more blood!"). Cut to halfway through the concert, and a mosh pit develops about three people behind us. Everyone that didn't want to be in it (or that formed the circle around it) were surging to get out of the way. I locked my arms in the manliest way a 16-year-old nerd can muster, but it was no good. We ended up being crushed against the rail. Soon enough, gf starts having a panic attack. Like a boss, I picked that bitch up, put my hand out like I was the goddamn Heisman, and marched her ass outta there. For those couple minutes, I was Alpha as Fuck.Summary:
Summarize: My boss does this crap all the time. He gets payed 30 grand a year to provide desktop support and a further 40 to do app dev work (which he doesn't do at all), but has gotten into the position where a few of us part time students can do all that work for him. Needless to say, we don't cover all hours of the day (which he does and is responsible for)... and are on extremely restricted schedules due to school. He has no idea what is actually going on with desktop support and constantly hounds us about tickets that were closed hours before because he doesn't actually click the refresh button. Lately he has been taking off 9+ days a month to "work from home" where he occasionally sends messages to us about work we've already done to feel like he's still in control. He also goes swimming for an hour or two every day and attends meetings that have nothing to do with his job most of the rest of the time. <3 bosses.Summary:
Summarize: This kid is ungrateful. $200 and an xbox 360! Dont get me wrong im a big ps3 fan and dont like xbox but the games are almost the same across the board now days. Maybe a few exclusives but otherwise... I wish he could trade parents with me for christmas when i was 16. The best gift i got that year was some roadside breakdown triangles kit. Other than that i got $30 from my grandma (actually that may have been the best gift) some $1 rasors, old apples off the table, my jewelry out of my jewelry box from a few years earlier, mini chocolate bars, and i think that was it. I was not ungrateful nor complained to them. This kid would probably shoot him self. We were really poor. If i had asked for something like a ps3 it would have been totally out of the question. No way anyone in my family could afford that even if they worked together and it was all i got. Some kids today are just ungrateful for what they get. Like this kid:Summary:

I can even help you with your math homework! Well, unless your a math major. Then I might not be so much help. That all probably made me sound like a lazy nerd. Not true! (Well, at least not the lazy part). I love going to the gym and running! We can even go backpacking and rock climbing! I love that shit! Some big stuff I can bring: kick ass sound system. Like ridiculous level. We can listen to some sick dubstep and techno on it. Classic rock is good too. I'll bring a xbox, desktop computer, laptop, wireless router, and a bunch of kitchen stuff. Oh, also really important: I'm not a slob. I do my dishes right after I make them. I clean things up, and wont make a mess. I don't mess with other people's stuff either. If it's not mine, I won't touch it. Send me a message, or email me at osnofla9@gmail.com. I can send you my fb and we can meet up sometime!Summary:

Summarize: So I want to give a little background before I continue on how the breakup even happened. I want to add that she was my high school sweetheart and my first everything. We had been together for 6 years. Around super bowl time last year my ex fiancée decided she was no longer interested in having a relationship with me. It was a complete shock to me just because everything was fine and we were 4 months away from tying the knot. I was trying to make since of everything but it was such a shock I couldn't think straight. Now don't get me wrong I begged and contacted her for awhile. I looked pretty desperate, but things change after I heard she was cheating on me. This wasn't the first time I had dealt with this with her, happened 2 years prior. She cheated on me with the same guy, for the same reason. He was more attractive and well I'm obese so I couldn't blame her I guess. Whatever, but the first time really killed me and I took a long time getting over her and I kept breaking the no contact rule so I was just being strung along the whole time. This time though instead of feeling bad for myself and being depressed. I quit my job, moved out of state and went back to college back home. I forgot to say that I moved a few states away for her and I also put college off so she could finish first and not worry about rent & bills. I cut her off all social media. I changed my number. It was time I gave myself attention and time to heal. Since this has happened. I have been messaged about 15 times on Facebook. I get friend request often even after I decline. Also I get told by my close friends that she ask about me quite often but not many people know what I'm up to since I just moved on from basically everyone and not much of a social media guy anyways. As for me I went back to school. Transferring to a university next year! Lost 100 pounds since, (still have 65 till my goal weight lol). Feeling like I know who I am and what I want to do in life. I stopped letting someone define me and who I was inside. I realized I was over her once I seen she had a new bf, I was genuinely happy for her. I use to get satisfaction that she still wanted to talk but now I don't care. I have few question that I still can't answer myself. Why is she still trying to talk to me, doesn't she get the hint? Am I douche bag for not wanting to at least have a conversation with her? I honestly feel that a real a friend wouldn't treat you like she acted. I wish her the best but should I feel guilty internally for not wanting to ever speak with her again?Summary:

Nidalee needs a laner with CC to really gank effectively (or someone who can combo well), and Lee Sin just doesn't work in silver. Looking for damage oriented, whether they be A/AS/AP.

Nidalee and Lee Sin don't seem good in Silver. Teammates don't ping wards, have bad or slow follow-up. Even with a level 3 double buff lee/nid gank, incompetent teammates don't respond to the gank half of the time or respond late. Being a tank jungler relies on your team following up your initiation, when none of the four that are near you do.

Summarize: How DARE gay people not want straight people in gay spaces that they feel safe in all the time! Most gay folks are more than happy to have straight people come in as the OP of the thread said, but the nasty truth is, sometimes gay people just want to be around other gay people. It's not really a sex thing (although that's part of it) - its a culture thing. I mean, think of it this way: for the sake of example, let's say you're a member of Faith A, and you've been invited to visit your Faith B friend's house of worship. You're welcome to come as a guest, listen, observe, be polite, etc. In fact, most places will welcome you with open arms. But let's say that you start inviting more and more of your Faith A friends to this Faith B house of worship, because you enjoy it so much. At what point does it cease to be a space for Faith B people? There are no gay houses of worship, and the cultural centers are few and far between and usually only in major cities. For gay folks, gay bars serve this purpose - as a community center, as a place to be themselves in their culture, and yes, as a place to meet like-minded people. They're really vital. And having a drunk bachelorette party there to gawk at the sideshow really dehumanizes gays in their own space.Summary:
Summarize: To give some quick background info, I am really prone to canker sores. I am not sure why, but every now and then a sore the size of a bb will appear in my mouth and over the next couple days it will grow to the size of a dime, then slowly fade away. I have played trumpet since fourth grade. Recently I got a job at a high adventure summer camp. During the training week, I saw that they were using a recording for the flag ceremony, and that they had a perfectly fine bugle in the storage room. I figured, "How hard can it be to swap over?" I spent some time practicing, and within the next day or so i could do the bugle call we used to raise the flags in the morning. So I spend the rest of the training week playing for the flag ceremony. There were no problems. the next week the children start arriving. We all line up, and i run to grab the bugle. But once we are lined up I realize that I have developed a sore on my lower lip. I decide to try to play through the pain since it is relatively new, and not too large yet. Apparently it was larger then I first thought. I raised the bugle to my lips and tried to play. Suddenly my lip felt like there was a needle sticking through it, and my embouchure was ruined. The noise I made was not dissimilar to what I think a duck being run over by a lawn mower would sound like. Desperately, I tried again hoping that I could force a good sound out. I was wrong, and I made another duck call. Fortunately they had the recording on standby, so seeing my problem they booted it up. Later I checked the sore and it seems to have skipped the tiny phase and gone right to the part where it seems to take up half a lip. i will definitely wait until the sore is gone before I try again.Summary:
Summarize: I see where you're coming from and I completely agree with you...but at the same time, I'm Disabled with a pretty shitty Neurological condition, and when someone around me says "OMG I have, like. The worst Migraine right now!" it makes me tic a little inside; anytime someone says it, in my head I'm thinking "Bitch you have no clue what a Migraine is like" , so I guess I can see where people that have OCD would have a problem with this. At the same time, if anyone's going to complain when someone says something like that, they better have that condition...nothing is more annoying than someone complaining over something that they have no place complaining about! Example: when someone from SRS tells another person that the rape joke they just made was completely evil and how dare they say that around people that have been raped...when they themselves aren't even in that category. That's annoying! And then what's worse is when someone that actually does fit into that category comes along and tells the SRSster that they're wrong, then the SRSster tells them that they're wrong!!! (example: I went into a thread where SRSsters were yelling at a guy that had just made a rape joke and were telling him that EVERY rape victim that read this is having PTSD and is crying in a corner...so I came along and said "Hey, I'm a rape survivor and honestly, myself and many others find and use comedy as a kind of therapy through this kind of thing."...so they all turned on me and said things like "OH SO HOW DOES IT FEEL TO BE THE VOICE FOR ALL RAPE VICTIMS?!!!" and "YOURE A MAN AND YOU COULDNT HAVE BEEN RAPED BY A WOMAN HOW DARE YOU LIE?!!?!")Summary:
Summarize: Buy a Swedish hooker. Put her through a very good education. Train her to speak perfect English and memorize a backstory of how we met, and how we fell in love. Then take her to my senior prom. Next durring senior week bring her to Loon mountain in New Hampshire ah have her teach me to ski. Then arrange for her and I to get stuck in an avalanche. I would then save her life and she would fall in love with me for real. But our love wouldn't be able to last. My Swedish hooker would be taken away from me because of a falsified visa I created to get her here in the first place. She is deported. I spend the remaning money traveling the world looking for my true love. Only to remember at the end of my journey that she is in Sweden. I travel there -funds nearly depleted- and comb the country side, searching, but to no avail. I, now nearly 80 years old, contract a deadly disease (it dosen't matter what) and I lay alone, in a foreign hospital, no money to my name; only to then see the smiling old face of my true love the Swedish hooker.

Summarize: Some time ago, when Riot remade tribunal with the better interface and stuff for voters, they also added results of the cases you voted on. I have seen people with reports in 5 games, threating other players with death and worse getting a warning. 1 out of 20 cases I vote on gets at least a small ban, the rest is warnings. So the reason is simple, tribunal is too soft. I'm sorry, but I don't think people repeatedly using death threats in chat should get a 'warning' and seeing how useless it is to vote on tribunal, it gets quite demotivating to continue.Summary:
Summarize: theoretically infinite In theory, but not in practice. Bit depth affects the dynamic range and the signal to noise ratio of digital recordings, which are also two very important characteristics of tape. Tape has much worse dynamic range and much lower signal to noise ratio than 16 bit digital recordings. It is reasonable to calculate the calculate the equivalent bit depth of a analog recording based on its dynamic range. The equivalent bit depth of a cassette deck could well be in the 6 to 12 bit range. This is based the 6 db per bit figure mentioned in the link below and a educated estimate that cassette decks offer from around 40 to 70 db of dynamic range.Summary:
Summarize: So I have read the story several times during my life and have always had a different view of the end than the general consensus. In the story she opens the box and all of the evils inside are let out into the world, and the only thing left in the box was hope. Doesn't that mean that there is no hope in the world? That hope is still inside the box that was holding all the evils of the world inside? I was just wondering if anyone else sees it like this, or to see if there is something I'm missing or misunderstanding.Summary:
Summarize: I thought I'd share my little discovery about the topology of X3 space. Every since I started X3AP I've always wanted to try and fly from the Earth to the Moon without using a jumpgate, just to see what would happen. I figured since each Sector of the X3 universe is obviously a separate "instance," that I would get to the moon and find it barren, i.e. with none of the stations or jumpgates parked in orbit as you normally find in the "real" The Moon sector. Like, it would be a fake-o alternate universe moon. But who knows? Perhaps the devs had done something really cool and secretly made the Earth/Moon one gigantic single sector. It would make sense, as these are really the only two sectors in the game in which the planetary objects are visible from each other. ....So anyway, expecting disappointment but curious nevertheless, I hopped in my fastest kestral, switched on some lovely SETA music, and blasted off from near-Earth orbit with the moon in my crosshairs! (I did the math beforehand and found the theoretical journey would be long, but very doable. If the devs had sized and placed the moon/earth to match anything close to real life, my Kestral going 605 m/s would cross the 384,000 km stretch in about 176 game hours....which is only about 30 real hours with SETAx6.) Unfortunately, my hopes were soon dashed, and while what I found was disappointing from a game-immersion perspective, it's interesting nonetheless: At only about 4000 km away from earth, things started to go wonky....objects the should have been behind me (like the jumpgate back at Earth and Terran patrol ships) suddenly appeared to be (far) ahead of me. Then I noticed that when I targeted any of these objects, my console registered the distance very strangely at: "-4294967 m". Also, my ship had inexplicably disappeared from the ship list seen on the sector map. As I was pondering the meaning of these oddities, my ship blew up. Say what? It just blew up, as if I had collided with something. Had there been a rogue asteroid that far out? I loaded my last save and tried again. And again, at around 4000 km out, my ship blew up, with no discernible obejcts nearby. Was the sector surrounded by an invisible force-field or something? Surely the devs wouldn't do something that lame... Well, almost that lame. Only by testing in other sectors was I able to figure out that I had crashed into the Earth itself . Actually, I had been warped inside the Earth, probably about 2000 kilometers underground Argentina. Because every sector in x3 is a kind of cubic torus ( If you travel too far from the center in any one direction, you emerge on the opposite side! In the sectors I tested, each sector is exactly 8,590 km across on the x, y, and z plane. Starting from coordinates 0, 0, 0, if you travel exactly 4,295 km in any of the prime directions, you'll be warped through to the other side heading BACK towards center, without skipping a beat. The background and all objects simply shift position instantaneously relative to your new position, and you keep flying (assuming there's no planet in your way!) So, the sectors of the X3 universe are infinite but bounded. What is still puzzling, though, is the strange transition period somewhere between 4000km and 4295km out, where you scanner goes haywire and you seem to exist in a kind of non-space. And I suppose there are some cool test you could run along the sector boundaries. What happens if you build a large complex straddling the border? Are the two halves really 8000km apart? Is it possible to transfer wares using a transporter device across this boundary? If you went to one of the "corners" of the sector, could you nudge your flight direction slightly and cause the background to swirl around crazily as you ship warps through four different borders every second? ...anyway, you can't fly to the moon. :( And incidentally, I don't think it is scaled correctly. At only 3000 km away from Earth, the moon was already becoming visibly larger, maybe by about 20 or 25%. And really that shouldn't happen until well beyond 100,000 km, I would think.Summary:
Summarize: I am currently in college after graduating high school a few months ago. I am not a dumb person. Up until the end of sophomore year of high school, I was always one of the smarter kids in class. I learned easily and gave a shit. I got mostly A's and some B's and occasionally a C. Towards the end of my sophomore year, I started to become a slacker and stopped giving as much of a shit. I wasn't as motivated and my outlook on school negated more and more as time went on. I got a C- in math because I hated it and it made me feel like shit every day because I refused to pay attention for some reason. Junior year, I basically failed Pre-Calculus (well, my teacher passed me with a D) both semesters, I was failing Chemistry at one point second semester (I was planning on dropping it, so I didn't try, but they ended up not letting me) and I didn't read my books on time in English. Senior year, I still don't give a shit and don't pay much attention in class, but it doesn't really matter that much because my schedule was easy and I didn't reallt have to try that hard. Now I'm in college, like I said, and I still have a shitty work ethic. I don't want to put effort into subjects I don't care about/have no interest in. I was supposed to read a chapter out of my anthropology book, which I'm not going to do because maybe we really won't have to ( yeah yeah yeah ...) and I really don't want to. I am dropping my stats class tomorrow because I don't want to go through math class again because it drives me insane and frustrated the shit out of me when I get behind (which is because I don't pay attention). I am aware that I sound like a complete loser, but that's how I feel. I can't seem to get it through my thick skull that I need to succeed at this. Maybe it's because I don't have an end goal (I don't know what I want to pursue for sure). Is all this normal? How do I get motivated and give a shit? Do I have ADD? Do I need adderall? Is college not for me?Summary:
Summarize: I've tried most of these "tips". But nothing actually works better, than having at least 5-8 hours of sleep, 6 being the sweet spot. You wake up feeling rested and you automatically just WANT to get up. Also don't turn on your lamp. Go from darker to lighter gradually, your eyes will hate if there's a bright light after solitude in darkness and you'll just hate everything and hide your head under the pillow and sleep in. If you wake up, open your eyes and stare at the ceiling or something, until you feel like your eyes are open, then you can turn on the light and proceed with morning activities. So if you're dead tired, and you only have 3 hours to sleep. I'd just recommend getting coffee or use some energizer and go in like a zombie and sleep properly the night after. Otherwise you're potentially risking on sleeping in, no matter what the trick is, in addition to not feeling rested. **Summary:
Summarize: A large majority of it is how much hipsters deny being hipsters, because of how much people in general seem to dislike them. A lot of larger cities (e.g. Madison, WI or the entire states of Washington and Oregon) seem to have large populations of hipsters because larger cities seem to beckon those who want to fit into recent trends. Oddly enough, the one time I was in Indianapolis, for such a large city, a surprisingly small population of hipsters. I don't think I ran into a single one while I was there. But back on topic, hipsters tend to be rather hypocritical, in that they claim to want to be unique and non-conformist, but they aren't unique, and they are conforming to a rather popular trend. And, often "uber-hipsters" will do things like, type-writing in a park, listening to vinyls on portable record players, or listening to lots of Mumford and Sons while pretending they're some kind of underground musical group (those of you who listen to, and enjoy, M&S without having some delusion that they are an unheard-of musical group, I'm not calling you a hipster, and are likely not one at all). Also, those examples I listed are all things I have witnessed hipsters do. It's an obnoxious trend, and many do these things to be counter-cultural intentionally, but have instead become part of a much larger culture. Now, in defence of hipsters, I have yet to meet a hipster, who also willingly admitted to being a hipster, that I didn't like. Those willing to admit they are hipsters have been, in my experience, very pleasant people, and don't tend to be as obnoxious about being a hipster. I don't know how prominent it is in other areas yet, but I have noticed a new growing trend within hipster culture of self-labeling as "indie" in order to separate themselves from hipsters, because, again, they aren't willing to admit they are hipsters, and want to separate themselves from the culture. Right now, if I knew anything about sociology, I would think hipster culture would be extremely fascinating to study.Summary:
Summarize: Hi reddit, My LDR (300 miles) bf (m/21) and I (m/21) have an almost perfect relationship (1 yr, 9 mos) in so many ways. Our personalities mesh extremely well, we share the same values, our families like each other, we're committed to each other for life (I am to him and he tells me he is to me). The other week I surprised him for 9 days and it went beautifully well. He took me in with open arms and it was clear that he has always been loyal and faithful to me. He showed me off to his friends and spoiled me rotten with both affection and good food. We have a lot of chemistry and the sex is normally very good (with some bad days because I was jetlagged coming straight from Asia when I saw him). I could only speak for myself when I say that I'm very attracted to him and it seems that it's mutual. The problem is that he sucks at communication. I mean, he's not AWFUL at it, but on a scale from 1-10 I'd give him a five. He goes through periods where he is excellent, and then drops off the face of the earth for a few days at a time, out of absolutely nowhere, and he's completely unreachable. Like, it's honestly impossible to tell when he's going to disappear, he just does, and it usually doesn't correlate with mood or anything, it's just completely random. I really don't get his psychology. Like, he appears to care about me but then vanishes. I learned about the mancave argument, but men who are entering caves often show some kind of hint, like, "I'm feeling really shitty, i need to get things sorted out." But his vanishing is not always to go into a cave, especially since when he's having a hard time he usually vents to me about it instead of going into a cave (he more often than not takes the traditionally female route with problems). When he emerges, I like to pretend nothing happened as he usually does, even though I feel like interrogating him in order to understand why he'd disappear like that. Note that I notice a positive correlation between him disappearing from facebook and disappearing from me. (When he goes NC with me he never does anything on fb). But since he talks to me so much more than his LD friends and family, you can't even compare, but his parents say he doesn't talk to them either during these moods, except during their prescribed Sunday night chats, during which he usually keeps the chats quick and still ignores me if he's in a "cold phase" (though sometimes that's when he breaks the silence since he's on skype anyway.) He always gets mad at me when I question his loyalty or ask him where he's been, because it upsets him that I "don't trust him" (It's not that, I really do trust him, I just want to understand why he disappears because it toys with my emotions). He tells me I overthink things. It's never been because of something I did wrong. Normally when I do something wrong he's very good at lambasting me about it (I like that about our relationship - he tells me what he feels so that resentment doesn't get a chance to build). My friends say (and my intuition too) that he disappears because he's simply not a thoughtful person about people who aren't around in person. He doesn't think about talking to me, he just thinks "oh, I can hang out and watch TV in the common room with my friends, [insert name of show] is on!" He doesn't think about me when I'm not around, doesn't consider me in his small decisions (but usually weighs my opinion heavily in his big/important decisions) he doesn't care about how I'm doing on a day-to-day basis - he assumes I'm a strong woman and can hold my own, doesn't want to indulge in missing me in fear of ruining his grades... I've heard a whole range of explanations. I just want answers and asking him just gets him so frustrated with me, telling me that I overthink things and am being ridiculous. It's not a "busy with work" thing. He has loads more free time than me. My bf is super quick and efficient with getting work done. While I was with him he got a 15-page report and powerpoint presentation done in around 10 hours total (over the course of 3 days) and he's done with class so he has all day free, and has zero extra-curriculars or jobs, so work is not a valid excuse. I know he has projects due but it's doubtful he'd ditch me for them, esp since he almost always procrastinates by talking to me while he's working. I left his place on Tuesday morning and the last time I heard from him was Tuesday night when I told him I got in okay and he seemed distracted. Normally after we visit each other he usually sends me a sweet romantic text, email, or fb message about how much fun we had and thanking me for coming or having him at my place, but this time there was nada, just one text asking me if I had enough money to get from the train station to the airport. It's surprising because I organized a nice surprise, brought him lots of gifts from where I was in Asia, we had a great time, and I was able to lift him out of a slump. Based on our visit though, I wouldn't say the spark is gone at all. It's alive and well. Our relationship is otherwise perfect. He just sucks at communicating. I spoke to some of his female friends (all are very genuine, honest people, and either gay or in committed relationships, don't worry) and they all totally sympathize with me and don't understand his behaviour either. They said if they were me they'd do the same thing (try to chase him) or worse (hit him upside the head, one girl joked), one of them even suggested I post it on reddit, so here I am.Summary:
Summarize: HAHAHAHA, guys this was the most fucking pathetic thing that has ever happened. So I've got one of these urges right, like fuck. Somehow, my monkey brain convinces me to go look at some pictures, which obviously led to a video, then I'm like "just a couple strokes bro", don't worry nothing will happen < the biggest deception ever. Then I get aroused so quickly I'm like fuck, ok stop now, now now now. I stop and then its like OH SHIT man OH SHIT I can't hold this in, I'm gonna fucking premature ejaculate after like 20 seconds man, never have ever I ever felt so demasculated, nor have I lost this quickly. As it came out, I was just watching my dick unload itself, and started laughing hysterically, like almost dying. It was just like that, streak was broken. No war, no battle, just boom, I lost so quickly. It's like I lost to my monkey brain in chess through scholar's mate. It was sadly hilarious. All in the span of like 5 minutes, from the urge to the orgasm (wouldn't call it that, more like cum-release). Anyways bros, that monkey talking will try to convince you somehow that looking at 'the latest porn', 'just to be reminded', and all that rationalization is pure bullshit and a trick by your mind. You are your own worst enemy. This hilarious mistake tonight is probably one of the best experiences I could of asked for, I will never trust my mind with any of this bullshit again, I've gotten away with it a couple times but your mind is always out to get you. The best route to take after an experience like this is laugh, as you were fooled but you will not be fooled again! Feeling bad about relapsing is absolutely useless, no need to feel bad, you fucked up. Now you know, you regret doing it but you're better off now. Regret over remorse. This is all a process of learning bros, a process of learning about how your mind is out to get you. It's not just about the streak, it's about the discipline you have after you relapse. Do not relapse multiple times, this is the worst thing and its your monkey brain trying to drag you back into the darkness. Your mind WILL rationalize that 'since you already did it once, what difference does it make if I do it 8 more times today, I'll start the streak again tomorrow, what's the difference anyways'. This is DANGEROUS, you must realize that every single time you PMO you are fading to black. We all make mistakes, but continously making those mistakes is a sure-fire way to lose all motivation and all momentum. Anyways, best of luck and keep fighting bros. This isn't just about NoFap but about discipline. You are subconsciously disciplining your monkey mind each day that passes.Summary:
Summarize: To resolve these issues I'd suggest 'Ask once, then deal with it appropriately'. Take clothes that are lying around and pile them in front of their door. If they don't move them for a week, throw them outside. Same as above, throw in front of their door or throw outside. Let milk sit out for a week. Then label it as yours. See if they enjoy it. Same with other food that is difficult to tell if it is bad or not. Ask for compensation. Ask them to wash the towel. If they don't, take one of theirs. Tell them that was a wise investment. Was it your pre-amp? Tell them negligence doesn't excuse destruction, and not paying attention to the road and hitting another car doesn't excuse a ticket and consequences. They're not 6, 'I didn't know' is not a viable excuse anymore. If they don't know, ask. There are noise laws, and if it exceeds the decibel range for the time of day or exceeds a time of 15 minutes (at least in my town) where it is disrupting your life you can get quite a few fines racked up against them. Ideally, pick your roommates better. I've never had a problem that lasted, and I've lived on my own for the past 9 years (29 now) in dorms, houses and apartments. Speak with authority, be up front, don't be an ass but be firm with how things need to work. Remind them if they're not going to play nice you have no reason to either.Summary:
Summarize: I was 8(ish). A bunch of guys were teasing my friend and I on our way home from school the day before. They didn't even know us, they were just being mean, throwing stones etc. One of them called us bitches. When the principal asked about it the next day he asked me what they said and if they called us names. I said one called us the b-word. The principal told me to use the actual word. I'd never said that word in my life! That was the scariest part. I felt so naughty just for saying it! (I'm 22 now and still don't swear often - even typing it feels kind of weird...)Summary:
Summarize: There's a Festival of India every year in downtown Charlotte. When I was about 13 I attended the festival on a Sunday, which took place in the Wachovia (now Wells Fargo) building. I got bored and being the reclusive idiot that I was, I wandered around the building alone and ended up in the main bank lobby. For some reason the lobby was empty - no security of any kind. I ran behind the counters and tried to open the main vault. Locked, of course. I was about to leave when, out of the corner of my eye, I saw a small vault on the floor against the wall. I walked over to find....an open vault with stacks of $20 and $50 bills. So, I did the obvious thing. I ran away. I was deathly scared someone would find out where I was and I'd end up in trouble. Out of breath I told my brother and a few of his friends what happened. Of course, no one believed me, but it still felt like I'd somehow stumbled into some secret passageway.Summary:
Summarize: My brother Tom, has been in a relationship with Julie for a few years. They moved in together at the beginning year, and shortly after Tom was arrested. He ended up breaking probation and spending 30 days in jail this past summer. After serving the 30 days, Tom was put on probation for 6 months after which his record would be expunged. Tom is a recent college graduate and until the arrest was planning on going to graduate school. I recently found out from my father that Julie in insanely controlling and emotional/physically abusive. I met her at my brother’s graduation, but don’t know her very well at all. On several occasions, Tom called dad crying after Julie had hit him telling him how stupid he is. Tom says he wants to break up with her but also says he’s so in love with her that he can’t. Tom had planned on applying to graduate schools once his record was clean and getting any old job in the meantime but claims it’s difficult to find a job because he’s constantly chauffeuring her around and she doesn’t let him go places alone. She keeps him from his friends and always goes through his phone, but won’t let him go through hers. Anytime they fight, Julie threatens to go sleep with other guys. My father helped support Tom the past couple months while he was looking for jobs and trying to get his stuff together, but dad started to feel like Tom was manipulating him and wasn’t actually trying very hard, so he’s been cut off financially for a few weeks now. Julie is a year behind Tom in school, but also has plans to go to graduate school. After they moved in together, Julie quit her job, so neither one of them is really bringing in any income at this point. Tom recently explained that he hasn’t been applying to graduate schools because he wants to wait another year to see where Julie is going to go. Dad has told him time and time again that he could always move back home to get on his feet, but he won’t leave Julie. Dad found Tom a job opportunity that paid amazingly well and was only part time, but Tom didn’t take it because it would have required him to be a 3 hour car ride away from Julie for two months. Despite his recent poor decisions, my brother is a smart, capable guy. Maybe his self-esteem is crushed and he’s afraid of being alone? Maybe he thinks no one will want to be with him since he’s been in jail and that he deserves someone like Julie? Maybe he’s just lazy? He talks about wanting to talk to a therapist, but won’t commit to actually doing it. Julie and Tom are going to my dad’s house for Christmas day, and dad told me he plans to have a “come to Jesus” talk with both of them. I advised against this, because I figured it would just push them closer together. I should also mention that my dad and Tom have always had a great relationship, and despite being financially cut off, they still talk regularly. My brother (technically half-brother) and I have never lived together and have always been several states apart, so while I love him and care about him deeply, I don’t feel that it’s my place to really start meddling in a situation that I’m not really part of. I’m worried about my brother and wanted to see if anyone had any advice I could pass on to my dad or brother about this situation. How should my dad and stepmother handle Christmas since Tom and Julie will both be there?Summary:

Summarize: The Neue Ziel is technically the strongest machine here in terms of raw strength, but has the distinct disadvantage of being designed explicitly for space combat. In the atmosphere it cannot use its bits and, more importantly, doesn't have any goddamn legs. While an extremely experienced pilot, like probably Anavel Gato, could pull off using it in gravity by cleverly manipulating its massive thrusters, Xerxes will be lucky if he can get the damn thing to move. The ACs on the other hand are designed for combat on Earth and will be far easier to manipulate. Speaking of ACs, did you know that the 4th generation ACs are controlled via a [nerve-machine interface]( Technically Leonidas and Spartacus don't have to actually learn to pilot at all since the machine will just do whatever they think for it to do.Summary:

You died? 80% of the time that's just bad positioning on your part. Yes, there is the occasional horrible team out there, but lets be honest, most of them aren't half bad. Instead of thinking about how horrible your team is, try thinking about what you're doing wrong that's getting you killed a lot. Also remember that your pistol ^^Deals ^^a ^^surprising ^^amount ^^of ^^damage isn't completely useless, and you can usually kill that tracer/genji if your aim isnt horrible. A widow is constantly asking you to heal her? Well how about, I dont know, healing her? Just because someone is asking you to do your job, doesn't mean they're being jerks.Summary:
Summarize: Honestly, im not sure if Bant control is very good anymore. Each of the four main types of control, Bant, Esper, American, Azorius, all had something that made them strong pre rotation. Bant had lifegain, fatties and ramp,Esper got killspells to deal with whatever they cant counter, American had burn and strong aggro finishers like Thundermaw, Azorius lacked all that but had two color consistency. Problem is, Bant control lost their core in rotation, which was the Rest/Thrag combo and farseek. So did American control when they lost Thundermaw. In my personal opinion, its best to run Azorius or Esper as control. They're the best positioned,as they maintained what made them good with rotation. Azorius is still consistent and Esper still has good kill spells. As a player of a successful bant control deck pre rotation bant to me now feels...weak and lacking. Taking my successful Bant Control list I ran pre-rotation (Top 4'd every FNM for 6 months straight), The only two green cards I ran were lost in rotation - Farseek and Thragtusk. These were good enough to warrant adding green to the deck, although they were only 8 in the 75. Post rotation, there isn't really a good substitute... Sylvan Cariyatid, while okay, is nowhere near as good as farseek. There's no substitute for Thragtusk. Thus there's no reason to run green in a control list in this standard, especially given the shakier manabase now that checklands are gone. If I were you I'd go back to a bant midrange tempo list with sylvan caryiatid and prophet of kruphix. Throw some monstrous creatures and cyclonic rifts and it could be really good. The one weakness of Bant is that it lacks good spot removal to deal with monoblack devotion. All the best answers are in at least azorious or esper colors. Ive ranted a lot butSummary:

The girl isn't seen as guilty of anything in this situation, just drawing a line in the sand (like you did). When it comes to a guy being friend-zoned the guy can't simply cut off the relationship because they aren't getting what they want, they look like dicks if they cut off the friendship, even if they are doing so to keep their emotional stability in tact (just as the girl was).Summary:

Summarize: So lately I've been pretty fed up about having never been in a proper relationship. So with so little success thus far, I've been trying various apps to meet people. One of the apps in particular I've tried is grindr (being bisexual), and I've started probably in the region of about 400 conversations with people on there. Of which about 20 actually responded. Goes okay for a little while... then when I ask if they want to meet, I get blocked or just a wall of silence. Sometimes I don't even need to ask that, and things will go silent/blocked anyway. Same thing has happened on other apps as well. So what is that I'm doing wrong? Am I coming off as creepy? Desperate? Simply unattractive to anyone?Summary:
Summarize: By now this comment probably won't be seen, but I have to add my story. I was working at a movie theater when a girl (whom I knew) came in drunk beyond belief. She was screaming, crying, laughing, going through the whole mood spectrum. I told a couple people, and it got back to her mother. Fast forward a couple weeks later, her mother sees me in the store and proceeds to rip me a new one up and down every aisle I visit because I was "spreading lies about her daughter who doesn't drink". We finally reach the checkout lines and "everyone" is staring. Most of them giving me the evil eye because I was around 19 at the time and she was a grown woman. Right before we split up into separate lines I looked her dead in the eye, said "I'll be praying for you" and looked away with a sad shake of my head. Every eye turned to her with the utmost detestation. She stuttered a couple times, couldn't find the words, and finally turned away to put her groceries on the belt. It was glorious. note We live in the bible belt, I'm atheist, she knew this and didn't think to use it in against me in my moment of triumph.Summary:
Summarize: Wow holy shit those bad guys are doing a pretty terrible job at pretending to get hit. The last two hits in particular are just not even close to landing. Then there's the dude that gets hit by the tv, and proceeds to raise his head up, then go back down then repeats that process until he needs to start fighting again, at which point he goes from unable to sit up to full steam fighting in like 2 seconds flat.Summary:
Summarize: If you want to be happy for the rest of your life never make a pretty woman your wife. So from my personal point of view get an ugly girl to marry you.Summary:
Summarize: Story time! So a little backstory; I had boxed at an amateur level for roughly four years at the time of this happening, this included competing at a national level so to say I was quite skilled in the pugilistic arts would be accurate. Edit: decided to add more about me and the guy Me: 4 years of boxing at the time. 160lbs 5'10, don't know about body fat or anything but I always had a six pack so I wasn't fat. Him: don't think he had any experience in combat sports or martial arts or what have you, but he played rugby and probably outweighed me by about 30lbs at the minimum with a typical rugby player body I.e. Very thick and dense but a bit on the soft bellied side, probably an inch or two taller than me. So i was at a house party which included about 30% I already knew and the rest being made up of friends of friends, everyone was having a good time. I was stood outside the house with a group of about 5/6 guys including myself, and as guys often do when having drinks there was some friendly back and forth, banter if you will, and it would seem one fella couldn't take a joke. I don't remember specifically what it was he had said but I remember that I replied with 'nah shut the fuck up' which got a few laughs from the other guys in the group, I was stood with the guy I replied to to my right about two feet away, and out of the corner of my vision I saw he take a swing at me catching me in the mouth. I instinctively shifted my right foot back and dropped my bottle going into my boxing stance, he threw another sloppy haymaker which I rolled (ducked) under, I started throwing back straight shots in combinations, just simple stuff double jab-right straight-leading to a lead hook basic shit, and by doing this I quickly drove him back to the wall of the house. This was basically my tactic for actual matches; drive them back to the ropes and work the body and head, and this is what happened then I only threw a couple of big shots before my friends pulled me away but as soon as I stopped hitting him the dude started talking shit again which I'll admit was very annoying. We left soon after and I heard from one of my friends who was on a rugby team with this guy that when he saw him a couple of days later he still had a bruised face and split lip, the worst injury I gained from this encounter was a minor welt on the inside of my lip were it hit my teeth mid sentence, along with some sore hands.Summary:
Summarize: When I first started dating my girlfriend she was a little chubby. Now, I didn't start dating her only for her looks... but her losing weight has drastically changed her personality for the worse. As a result she's gained quite a bit more self confidence and is being more aggressive with me. She will tell me things like "get off your lazy ass and start making some money". She never used to be so bossy with me. I make $120k/year.Summary:
Summarize: There was Ancap Minecraft. It was interesting. There was 1.0. It was apparently more interesting. Then some guy released the map. That guy was called Hamster. People xray'd diamonds and things, so the admins gave us 2.0 We are in 2.0. "HCF" is a general term for people who come from Faction servers, namely the HCF server on the Shotbow network. There was a lot of HCF invasions and big vaults and fighting. lots of hacking and world downloading, too, so people were banned. Some people didn't like other people so they used the HCF to settle their mature issues. they collaborated with the HCF and supplied them. It was a huge problem to accuse someone of collaboration whether it was true or not. It was like a communist scare in Cold-War America. I think at this point the World Police existed. They did stuff in 1.0 and 2.0. They pearled a lot of people in a war against Bloodcrew and a guy named Dill. Then they became the LADS. People didn't like what the LADS did. The LADS moved to Duck City and the people who didn't like the LADS sided with the HCF in what was known as the "Duck Roast." The LADS then went and pearled those people, too. Lots of people were caught world downloading and interesting stuff like that and got banned. Then the Recharge came at some point and broke LADS vault and people were upset. Recharge geared themselves and stomped Duck City. Recharge made River's End and the server turned it into a massive waterpark after Recharge got banned/pearled. Then some people griefed some cities because they were scared of pixel horses. Then this summer came. Mexicans scared us. Some Brazilian bystanders almost were permavaulted. But so far it's peaceful between all cities, which is surprising because summers are usually hell.Summary:
Summarize: A few years ago I was working as a camp counsellor for poor/troubled kids from inner city LA. One of the kids was evil incarnate. He would threaten other kids, generally disrespect everyone, and for multiple nights in a row try to run away into the woods. All of this culminated in me not getting any sleep for 3-4 nights in a row. Now, the camp was only a week long for his session, but he ended up getting kicked out halfway through after he got in a fight with another camper. However, prior to this, everyone in my cabin was supposed to do a fun tower climb activity. Everyone wanted to do it, including him. It comes time to do the climb though, and he refuses to listen to safety instructions/causing every other camper to not be able to do it. He then proceeds to try to run away (again, into the woods where he would basically die from being miles from nowhere). I tried to reason with him, but he started pushing me and baiting me to do something. After a few minutes, my co-counselor got there and took over, but I've never been closer to hitting a child (he was around 13). I was so shaken by it that I had to go off on my own, at which point I broke down in tears. I was so ready to haul off and cold clock this little shit stain of a kid, and I couldn't believe that I could have even gone that far. It doesn't seem that much, but it made me really think about myself and what kind of man I am.Summary:

Summarize: The only reason that this could be impacted is if you have a double hub/spoke architecture with the fileserver on one hub, XBMC on the other. This would clutter the single link and if you were attempting to transfer other large data streams simultaneously, possibly be detrimental to playback. That being said, 1080 (as Anand999) mentioned does not saturate a 100 Mb line completely.Summary:
Summarize: I want to call attention to this, utterly dark reason why I DREAD people right up until Gold who lock in as support. and yes I did just lose for one again. The worst type of support player, the type I see up until Gold every time then vanishes (thank fuck) is the type who picks it not to win, not because they like the champion, not because they trust their ability to carry or even be carried. It's because they realised they can't carry, pick a role at low ELO that they know nobody expects them to carry from, and proceed to instantly flame the moment something goes wrong because they know - they KNOW - they're probably losing anyway. The support by default, because then they won't be challenged (mostly) on their flaming opinions as the REAL cause for the loss. This Blitzcrank literally intentionally fed because of our Graves though, so slightly different. This type of player arises because of three misconceptions about the role at lower ELO: The Support is expected to be just that, a support, and thus is not expected to be the team's carrier. The Support is not, at lower ELO's, seen as the deciding factor in lane. Actual support mains fly out quickly because of this. The Support's deaths do not matter. Seriously. Those of you in low ELO know this, those in high ELO may have forgotten this but below Gold people believe it is OK to die as support . Seriously. You realise you mke the trade 1-1 or leave your adc 1v2, and are STILL WORTH GOLD RIGHT? The support ends up being the default role fro two types of people (excluding last pick). Either the guy expecting to be carried by his duo, or the guy who wants to be in the prime position to blame his team. After all, the support can never be the reason for the win, so how can he be the reason for the loss? This is an attitude in lower ELOs I continuously see. I''m on my third time up to Gold because I can never get motivated to jump a tier unless there's a time frame or an extenuating circumstance but really, now that supports can have high gold incomes, these poeple stick out like a sore thumb. It's not often referred to in the troll videos I see, but it's seriously common. The support is a great role. It CAN carry, it fits a specific niche of play style and if you're going to undertake the role, respect it . It can hold so much power is played right.Summary:
Summarize: My boyfriend (22), well, now ex-boyfriend and I (19f) broke up yesterday. Our relationship was both awesome and terrible. Awesome in the fact that we both cared for each other passionately and had very similar interests, including music, movies, etc. I loved him. He was my first love, first sexual partner, first everything. I was his second everything, but that's another story. Anyway, the relationship sucked due to many reasons, including, but not limited to: lack of trust, habitual lying, physical and emotional abuse, mental health issues. We were best friends for about 4 months before we were officially "together" and were friends with benefits for about 2 of those 4 months, leading up to us making it "official." We were officially together for 10 months. So yesterday, he quite unexpectedly tells me that we are now breaking up but he wants to stay friends. We've had many, MANY "break-ups" in the past, but every time, we decide we can hash it out and that we love each other too much to let it slip away. This time, I don't give a fuck and it seems, neither does he. I love this guy, so much, and honestly, I think he's my "soul-mate," but a break-up is much needed for us right now, and possibly forever. What I'm wondering is, can a couple who has been through a lot together and has both sexual and romantic energy between them, go back to being "just friends," especially if there is unresolved tension due to issues in the former relationship? I don't think we can. I value his friendship and his love, which is why I don't think I can separate the two now that we've been together as lovers. However, thinking back to when we were "just friends," I seriously valued him and loved spending time with him. I'm just not sure I can imagine what it will be like not to touch him or hug him or kiss him when we're doing simple "friendly" things like watching a movie. Anyway, just wondering if anyone has any thoughts and/or experience on the "just friends" situation after a break-up.Summary:

Summarize: TommyPickles1987 is faggot_emo_kid and I will tell you the story of how this all came abut: faggot_emo_kid used that username for his reddit account for 8 months and generated a good amount of karma. He posted this on reddit, and it was upvoted to the high heavens instantly. Being more of a 4chan user, he just posted this without thinking about his username being an issue. Keep in mind the letter and money are more than likely legitimate, and this issue of the stolen charizard card is probably known by various other people. The OP got in contact with his friends who were there during the theft, and directed them to the reddit post instead of the 4chan post. His friends from his past looked at it saw the post, but couldn't help but notice the username. With this picture also being on facebook, many people he is friends with IRL had access to his reddit account, including the person who sent him the letter. With a large number of his comments being racist comments in r/circlejerk, it led me to the conclusion that the person who sent the letter is an African-American (Let's call him Tim) individual who has recently turned his life around. Tim saw faggot_emo_kid's post and a number of his past racist posts in r/circlejerk, and realized that OP was not the type of person he thought he was. Tim confronted the OP, and told a few other people about what he found on reddit, and so TommyPickles1987, formerly known as faggot_emo_kid, needed a way to quickly cover his tracks. He then came up with the brilliant idea of salvaging his reputation IRL, and on reddit. He makes a new username that he knows people will love, and posts this bogus story. He posts 2 separate links that he knows will be instantly upvoted, and makes sure to comment as much as he can, so he can go ahead and collect both comment and link karma that was not accumulated from r/circlejerk. Ladies and Gentlemen of reddit, what took place here was a karma heist, a very well thought out karma heist, that was nearly foolproof.Summary:
Summarize: I'll try and keep this short... edit: OOPS not short. I have been dating this amazing girl for almost 2 years now. We met on a job together and after that we have been inseparable. This is a somewhat long distance relationship, we live (give or take) 75 miles from each other... About her... She is very mature we are both in our early-mid 20's. She pretty much makes the bread and butter in her family so she does not have much time to do anything else. She does not really have any friends because of this. I pushed her to go out and meet some people because I felt it would be good to step outside of her "situation" aka family. She did this... She started hanging out with a girl she was friends with on facebook. Here is where it gets saucy... This girl regularly cheats on her boyfriend, and she made it apparent that while my gf is with her hanging out she doesn't want her to talk to me on the phone. She sighs turns up the music etc. whatever. The first time they hung out they went to a bar, and the girl started flirting with guys in order to get them to buy them drinks. Then she wanted my gf to "hang out" with one of them "alone". Once I found out I told her I wasn't comfortable with this so she told her friend that she doesn't want to go to bars to "pick up guys". My girlfriend does not drive so she is at the mercy of her friend. A few weeks ago my gf and I made plans to hang out. I drove the mileage and was prepared to meet my gf, we had a specific time. Her friend was going to drop her off to meet me. So I'm waiting and waiting, and calling her and she's not picking up the phone. Then an hour later I get a text saying she's on her way and I would see her in 30 minutes. I waited an hour and a half and called again. My GF told me they have not left yet because she's hanging out with a guy and he keeps buying her friend drinks. So I continued to wait and finally decided to go pick her up myself. So I drive all around town looking for this bar. Around 3:30 (we were suppose to meet at 11pm) I get to the bar they are at and they are just leaving. So I tale them home. (she knows this, I told her I was going to pick her up myself but I guess her friend wanted to leave before I got there). So I finally get back with her around 4:30 and my gf is plastered (she never drinks). This is a cycle, ever week she hangs out with this girl and they go to bars. I know this is normal but this girls intentions in my opinion are just to find guys to cheat on her boyfriend with and my gf has become her wingwoman. Now while they are out my gf does not answer her phone or texts because her friend doesn't want her to talk to me while they are hanging out. My gf is very respectful and in my mind would never cheat on me. But the fact is this girl she's hanging out with (has many problems) and is using my gf to feel better about herself, and I am not ok with that. Lately whenever I have said anything negative towards her friend she has been sticking up for her which I double do not like. And now I am at today... They have kicked up their friendship a notch and started hanging out a lot more. I warned my gf that this friend she has is not a good person and shes using her to get with guys but she won't have it that way... Anyway I am moving 300 miles away while my gf is staying behind. So lately I have been more and more wary of this friend because now she will have a lot more time to hang out with her. I told my gf to get out more and find more friends than her current "friend" but her excuse is, since she doesn't drive she feels like it's a burden to the other person. Am I justified in not approving of their friendship? All I want is my gf to be around nice normal people when I'm gone, but she is content with this girl.Summary:
Summarize: You punch the computer wall of your makeshift hive again in frustration as your husktop proceeds to freeze up. You were damn sure your programs would actually succeed at preventing stuff like this freezing up your computer, but you have to admit to yourself, you were always a lousy programmer. You were far more mechanically-minded. You stare blankly at the familiar fist indentation in the machine next to the husktop for several more moments before you go about and begin to captchalogue most of your possessions. You were about to embark on a trans-Pacific voyage, after all. As you marked a spot in the archaeologically potent environment your sylladex always automatically generated, to store one of your --Dooms--Day --DeviCes in that spot, you pondered the ways you might arrange for transporation to Australia. If you remembered correctly, Australia was across the largest ocean that could possibly divide two continents on this planet. This meant swimming was far too time-consuming an option, as was waiting for an Alternian transport ship or searching for a teleport pad. This planet was very backwater, and seeing how it hadn't been conquered yet, neither of these extraplanetary resources were abundant yet. You suppose you could travel to the big airport at Human Albuquerque or the big seaport at Human Los Angeles and stow away on one of the primitive means of human transport. Yes, that's what you'd do, and you were always most efficient at avoiding detection, so infiltrating either port would be no problem whatsoever. As you automatically bury your collection of books, you look fondly at the spot you always hid your DATA-WIPER, the small remote control-like device you used to wipe any signs of your presence from the primitive, easily manipulated human technology. This had to be your proudest and most prized invention yet. You then proceed to captchalogue your BROKEN RC LEGO MILENNIUM FALCON (piece of shit that it was), your entire collection of skulls, bones, and other archaeological artifacts, various machine parts, other half completed projects of yours including several incomplete doomsday devices, the INCOMPLETE PROTECTIVE SPHERE GENERATOR, and the INCOMPLETE JESUS JUICE SERUM. Unfortunately, for both of these latter two, positively aligned projects, you'd hit major blocks while constructing and were stuck. You simply couldn't build any more doomsday devices without completing any protective devices as well; without protective devices as well, not only would your doomsday devices potentially kill you as well as their intended planets, but your KARMATIC EQUILIBRIUM would be thrown completely out of balance. You had to take care to guard both the gates to hell and to heaven equally, lest uneven devils or angels escape and achieve dominance. Now that you're at the bottom of this overly-wordy post, you're pretty much completely packed prepared for later archaeological rediscovery, save your Husktop, which you left out just in case it decided to cooperate. As you check on you husktop's responsiveness, you try to sense where Wolfmom has gotten off to, carefully listening and sniffing the air to see if you can detect her.Summary:
Summarize: I had a friend argue with me today because he got temporarily banned for saying, "GG Ez" at the end of a bunch of games. When you put down the other team right after they just suffered a loss, you're still going to cause them to be upset. Just because you're not calling them bad or directly insulting them, you still lower how they already feel. My friend was arguing that the league community sucked so badly they couldn't even handle things like being said, "GG Ez" and too me, he was the one that was the problem with the community. The snobbery/putting down of others is the problem with the League community, not the people who are offended by it.Summary:
Summarize: Dashers are a new movement concept for flying bots. They are a lightweight compromise between rotors and airfoils. They combine the agility of airfoils with the stability of rotors and have a large building cone similar to walker legs and take up a very large amount of space on a bot. In order to move, they flap up and down very quickly similarly to dragonflies. Here is a short video showing how dragonflies actually fly and how it might be like in Robocraft. Stats: (T10) Health-20,000 CPU Load-30 pFLOPS Heal Rate-2.00 Resistivity-15% Barrier Protection-25% Max Carrying Mass-400 Max Speed-300 mph Overclocked Max Speed-400 mph Max Ceiling-900m Overclock Max Ceiling-950 m As you may have noticed, the Dashers have very little health, but they also have a relatively low resistivity to allow them to survive around 2-3 SMG rounds. They are also extremely fast but have a very low carrying capacity and will be destabilized by thrusters and Helium. Along with this, they also have a higher flight ceiling to allow them to escape both interceptors and SMG tanks. Pros: -Most agile movement part in the game. Able to move far faster than average planes or even sleds at 250-300 mph and possibly 400 mph on OC 13. -Can stop mid flight, vertically takeoff and land, and have the stability of rotors. -Extraordinarily maneuverable. -Relatively low CPU load to allow for extra gear -Somewhat high heal rate for quick healing Cons: -Very fragile and have a large, bulky hitbox similar to rotors. -Take up large amounts of space on bots with a large building cone similar to walker legs. -Very low weight capacity. Can barely hold 6 weapons. Only meant for extremely light stealth bots. -Low speed gain from thrusters and helium. Thrusters and helium will make them highly unstable and hard to control.Summary:
Summarize: Ok we all know that Madara is Op as hell with may i add, Only one rinnegan. How will he die you may ask? Even Kishimoto (As i recall) said he is having trouble thinking of a way for him to die. I have a theory about how he would die. We all know that Obito when he became "Juubito" Almost lost his mind to the juubi. What if my some shear luck Madara does lose his mind to the Juubi, lets face it Madara with both rinnegan, power to destroy any Jutsu, and a juubi jinchuriki at full power i may add, is just OP, So if he loses his mind it would still be on another level but wouldnt be as godly.Summary:

Summarize: Posted this on another thread but it is more relevant here Last year, to celebrate the new year, my friends and I went to the beach, a friend has a house there... We have done this a couple of times, but this time was "special" because our friend turned 18... So his parents serve us a little bit of wine, they have a toast and then leave us to eat dinner... Another friend says "tonight will be just like The Hangover....lol jut kidding." Little did we know he was right... We go down to the beach, and get our drink on... Needless to say we all got super hammered. Our friend who turned 18 though was really sad, because he said he wanted to hook up with this girl and then another friend made out with her... So he was shitfaced, and making a fool of himself, so I tell him " hey lets go sit" and he got mad and grabbed a thick ass stick and threw it and it just so happenned to land on my face... Drunken me of course thought he did it all on purpose... So I let him be and storm off pissed as shit... Then, at 6 am we all decide we were going up to the house to get some rest... So we all up gather at the disco but wait... Our just recently turned 18 friend, lets call him Mike, was MIA, he was the one who was sad and angry because another friend hooked up with a girl he wanted to hook up with... Anyways, we all knew of what he was capable of doin drunk... Reckless shit... We searched for about an hour, nowhere to be found. We call his cell, someone picks up, we are all glad cause we think it is him, it is not, he had left his cell back at the house... We all seriously thought he had gone to take a swim drunk as shit in the ocean ( he did this last year, luckily we were all there and able to stop him from getting in ) and he mightt have drowned or something... About and hour later, a friend who had stayed back at the house because he had gotten sick said Mike's dad found him passed out on the balcony... His father did not make a big deal out of it... But we did not want his mother to find out because she would throw a fit... In the end, I was supposed to go back home with Mike because he lived real close to my house, ended going back with another friend to his place which was in no way close to mine, becuase his dad adviced me to becuae his mother was going to question me... Scariest moment of my life....Summary:
Summarize: I was tripping more than I thought could be possible with weed, I can only imagine that I was at least at an [8] whereas before I had only been able to hit a good [4] or [5]. So, in detail, this is the story of how I got there and what it felt like, enjoy my leap to adulthood! Background: Yesterday I asked my friend to stay the night at my place and we could hang out. This friend we can call "Z". Z is the friend I always smoke with, he is the one who provides the bud, in fact, he's the one who introduced me to it a couple months ago. To his best ability he had tried to explain the effects of marijuana to me but every time we smoked, I never felt what he was talking about. I would usually get to a, still completely functional human being, kind of high, just a little more than a buzz even after an entire bowl. For a while though we only smoke Sativa. But last night that streak ended. Yesterday: Z shows up at around 9:00 and sets his bag down on the bar. Instantly he begins pulling out his bong, grinder, pill bottles, and a few other things. I didn't even expect to get high that night but since he insisted, I started preparing the bong with some ice and water while he pulls out a sweet nug and tells me that it's straight Indica, (Which I knew I had never smoked before).I was pretty excited. Grinded, packed, and prepared we took the bong to the back porch and sat down on a couch. ~9:45 Straight into it. I took the first hit, cornering the bowl (thanks to the 420 code), and coughed that shit out like a pussy. It had been a few weeks since I last smoked, plus I'm no veteran so yeah I have my excuses. I felt it though, I knew it was a good hit [2]. I passed it to Z and he took his, bigger than mine of course, but he didn't clear it. It sat for a few seconds when I noticed it wasn't cleared so I took the opportunity, coughed even worse after that. Z took another hit whilst I grabbed a couple waters and sat back down. After that I only took one more hit and cleared one of his and that's all we smoked. Later we would realize that it was merely the top of the bowl, but shit that's all it took to blast me. Stage 1. Within seconds of my last hit everything went weird. [6] I remember feeling like everything was moving at about 5 fps (for all you struggling PC gamers who know the feel). Z started the deep conversation and as much as I wanted to listen and partake, I was freaking out. I had never felt this before. My heart was racing, everything felt slow, and paranoia hit and I began telling Z, "Let's go inside, I'm having a bad trip." Z being the bro he is, calmed me down and informed me that I'm okay, I'm only on drugs, which now seems a bit counter-intuitive but it helped then. I began to think of how long this was going to last and how stupid I was to get this high. We eventually moved inside and sat on the couch watching TV. ~10:05 Stage 2. [8-9] I feel like I'm out of my body, floating somewhere, then I would come back and realize where I am. I kept forgetting where I was and what the hell was going on about every minute. But I would look at Z and be reminded of everything. I remember explaining to him what was going on somewhat like this, "It's like all that I see and know is our conversation, like you and me here right now connected. Then I look around and it's like I remember life, and I keep doing this every 5 minutes. Like holy shit there's a whole life out there and I just learned about it...again!" It was really cool to that this was happening. I was amazed at something that I literally live everyday. By this time I had remembered some advice I read on /r/trees saying not to worry, and just sit back relax, and enjoy it which is exactly what I began to do at this point. I was loving it. Although I realized my stupidity in how I was speaking and I apologized to Z saying sorry I'm not being deep right now and I'm talking really dumb. for example I kept thinking it had been DAYS when it had only been a few minutes. To which he replied, "Bro don't worry, I know for a fact that you're actually really smart." This got me more excited, I couldn't wait to get back to when I was going to be smart again. I was ripped. I got so excited that I was this high that I told Z we needed to watch some Lucas Bros. Moving Company since it's practically made to be watched while high. I ran upstairs to grab my laptop. ~10:30 Music. Glorious fucking music. At the top of the stairs I noticed my keyboard(Digital Piano). Instantly distracted I began playing. At first the keys seemed to be moving and I wasn't able to keep up, but I just trusted my instincts and began playing Fur Elise. Oh my God I was lost in the notes. I could see and feel the music. That feeling was seriously the most awe inspiring feeling that I had ever felt. I played multiple songs for fifteen minutes straight, which to me then felt like forever, when I noticed Z behind me laughing his ass at how high I was and recording me with his phone. He loves messing around on my keyboard sober so I asked him if he's ever played high. He took over and began to play. It wasn't any real songs but to us it was the voices of angels singing in our ears. I lied down on the floor and enjoyed it thinking, this is the best time of my life. Contempt with everything I wished I could had stayed there forever. Although, our piano play came to an end sadly. But we moved into the upstairs game room where I have a large Bose sound system I just couldn't resist. I plugged up my phone, opened Spotify, and cranked it up. I believe the song we played was Holiest by Glass Animals. It felt like I was at the concert. I was completely lost in the music and enjoying it when suddenly my logic kicked in. It's 11:00 and the neighbors have kids. If they call on a noise complaint, It probably wouldn't end well. So I stopped the music and finally grabbed my laptop. ~11:something We were back downstairs. I set up my laptop to the TV and afterward rewarded myself because I was amazed that I could do such a thing.(I'm pretty tech savvy and know more about computers and stuff than the average computer user so I don't know why I was so surprised by me plugging an HDMI cable into my laptop and being able to see it on the TV screen). By now I was still tripping but not nearly as bad as before. I'd say I had dropped to a [6-7]. We enjoyed the rest of the night watching some Lucas Bros and eating chips and snickers then crashed upstairs on the couches. In the morning I got up at 6:30, shaved, showered, and even cooked some sausage that we both ate before we left for school. I gotta say I expected more of a hangover but I was surprisingly productive. Anyways, that's the story of how I experienced my first real trip. It was fantastic, and wouldn't have been that great if it weren't for Z to be there with me the whole time. Thank you for reading if you did, please tell me if you enjoyed it or if you have any similar or bizarre experiences when reaching a new high.Summary:
Summarize: Men in western culture are attracted to boobs basically because society tells us they're attractive. Even from a young age guys are bombarded with media and observation that shows breasts as sexual objects. As for how they were considered sexual in the first place, its because we go to such great lengths to cover them up. In societies where breasts are completely exposed, they're not considered sexual. In some African cultures that expose breasts, men consider thighs to be sexual because they are covered up. In strict Islamic societies, ankles, as well as other female parts, are considered obscene because they go to great lengths to cover them up. When a culture demands that women cover up some part of their body, men associate it as a forbidden fruit of the female anatomy. In nudists communities, simply walking around naked is not considered sexual, because everyone is just desensitized to it.Summary:

Summarize: Honest to god, Mark Henry during that mid-2000s, red singlet, pre-Hall of Pain, Kool-Aid Man phase. I remember being like 14 and channel surfing past Smackdown in time to see him in some random throwaway squash where he no-sold all of Chavo Guerrero's shit and World's Strongestly Slammed him to death. It might have been part of the Chavo/Hornswoggle feud. I didn't know anything about wrestling at this point, I just remember thinking, "wow, that dude with the dreads is badass." It was funny to me how clearly out of his depth Chavo was.Summary:
Summarize: This code comes up because the ECU is trying to run in closed loop, and is having to add more then a certain amount of fuel to achieve Stoich (14.7 AFR for gas). It only does this durring idle and cruise. Your fuel map under load/boost runs in open loop and does not take direct feedback from the O2 sensor. So you might have a good tune but a faulty sensor or other issue might be causing this issue in closed loop. The real problem is the ECU is having to add more then a certain ratio of fuel to achieve stoich which is triggering the CEL. The danger is that it will also apply this ratio to your fuel map across all loads and will cause your previously good tune to run rich and possibly cause damage.Summary:
Summarize: You should learn to "adjust gears" - it's basically a requirement of long term training anyway. If you're going balls to the wall every time, that's your issue. I (a featherweight male) was training with a newbie yesterday who had 30 lbs on me, and he was blown away, claiming "You're so strong!". I was going ~10%, simply feeding him the responses so he and I could work on what we learned in class. With your attitude, I would've smashed the shit out of him, and he wouldn't have learned a thing. Instead, he got to work the two things he knew, and I got to work my escapes.Summary:
Summarize: Okay boys lets get this shit started, yesterday I was at a party, with some friends. To our group of friends / aqauaintances belong three girls. One of these girls is in a relationship with a good friend of mine, the other isnt important for this story and THE OTHER is the one I am / was interested in. So we were getting pretty drunk and she started talking to me. Although I ain't the MOST experienced guy, you could tell... there were some hints (talking about sex, other guys, girls.. you name it). For the rest of the evening we were running around together, drinking from one cup, her two best friends telling me (if in a joking way or not I CANT TELL SINCE I WAS FUCKED UP) to make a move, while she heard it and laughed in a positive way. All these events led to me taking her aside after 2 hours or so and asking her whether she has a boyfriend (now this is interesting): she said that INDEED she does have one, but instead of shaking me off, she kept bugging me, kept asking me WHY I asked her this. I basically kept replying "you know exactely why im asking" and she kept saying "no i really dont", I would then go with "its quite obvious isnt it"... she: "no i dont understand". After that I regrouped with my friends and she with hers to talk about this shit and share my defeat. Having talked to them I still decided not to face the defeat and make one LAST TRY. Went to her best friend (which I have a relativly good relationship with) and asked her if what she was talking concerning her boyfriend is actually true. Her friend didnt really confirm it, its basically 50% of a relationship over a long distance, but she doesnt know much more. So I really dont want to piss you guys off with this wall of text, but the last part is inbound: With this knowledge I proceeded to re-open a conversation with the girl I was intersted in and I basically admitted outright that I am interested, but at the point at which she asked if the interest is momentary and just for the evening OR has a deeper root her stupid other friend intervened and I couldnt answer. After that I didnt get another chance to isolate her in order to clear things out and its pissing me off because ... i dont know... I dont get why she just didnt tell me that she has a boyfriend and keep it that way OR tell me that shes single allowing me to kiss her with a clear consciense. EDIT: Just remembered that there was another situation I initially forgot about: just before we left she was talking to 5-6 younger guys (idk about what, thats not the point) and they were CLEARLY hitting on her.. well anyway fast forward when we were just leaving she said to me: " why didnt you save me from them haha?" . ... just thought this might be important for the entire story, to put things in place. Tonight we are going out alltogether again. HOW SHOULD I PROCEED? WOULD IT BE DESPERATE TO CONTIUNE MY MOVE, OR DOES IT NOT MATTER SINCE I ALREADY REVEALED MY INTENTIONS? THE END. Cheers if you read all this shit ;)Summary:
Summarize: Hey! I think you should totally go for it and it sounds like you're getting your shit together early on! I'm a filmmaker in my early 20s and knew a BUNCH of people who came into film school saying the same thing you're saying. After graduating I can count on one hand the people who may actually have a chance at that. I'm not one of them, and I am very happy not to be. Keep in mind no matter how hard your work or how much time you put into it you aren't that Oscar before you're 25 if you don't have a genuine passion for the art of film and filmmaking. I'm not saying you don't have passion, you clearly do, but I firmly believe that you have to be willing to let the work be its own reward, and potentially give up the oscar in favor of making a film that you are happier with. I know a guy who's directed a ton of shorts and had an internship in LA and is probably one of the most disciplined filmmakers I knew. He got the drive, but he doesn't explore his art, and his films suffer for it. PM me if you need help with any post production/animation!Summary:
Summarize: I'm a twenty-four year old female and my boyfriend and I are becoming more and more serious as time goes on. We have been together for one year now. Here is the problem: his brother, who he lives with, is an absolute asshole. Before going on to describe why this is such a problem for me, I want to talk a little more about his brother, who I will call Josh. Josh regularly describes the shitty ways he treats women and the shitty ways he tries to sleep with as many women as possible. Now, while I don't necessarily think it's bad to sleep with a lot of people (if it's consensual and done respectfully on both parts), he intentionally manipulates women to get what he wants and then is really mean to them after things are over. He admitted to having left a girl in the middle of the woods when she was high on ecstasy and he was drunk (he was driving) because she annoyed him and he no longer felt like getting in her pants. Another example: this summer he knew this one girl who he had met online wanted a relationship from her online profile, yet he went out on a date with her solely for the intention of having sex with her and never sleeping with her again. He hadn't slept with anyone in four months, so he really just wanted to get laid. Now I know a lot of people do this, and I can understand his sexual frustration, but the way he did it was really shitty. He slept with her, then the next day talked to my boyfriend and I about how fat she was and how disgusting she was and what bad lay it was. These things are possible, but the way he discusses them is rude and uncalled for. It's simply indicative of his general disrespect for women. He has a technique he has called the "machine gun makeout" which is basically to keep leaning in to kiss a woman, and each time she turns away, he tries again, and keeps trying until she gives in. He combines this technique with his "drink technique" of buying girls a drink, letting them drink half, then slamming the rest himself and buying them another one. This one is based on the theory that girls drink the first half of their drink really fast and the last half slow. He is honestly this manipulative. One time Josh made a pass at me about two months after his brother and I were official and I (obviously) turned him down. I told him "I couldn't be less attracted to you given your shallow personality", yet when I told his brother about it Josh claimed I had been wanting him all along and was asking for it. Josh spends all his days off work smoking weed, drinking, and trying to use more women for sex. I don't have any problem with weed and drinking, but both of those things are pretty much all he ever does. He has no ambition. No wish to find someone he cares about and settle down. No wish to ever have kids. He just wants to go to work and then party on his days off. Lastly, Josh is terrible with money. He makes almost $100k a year but lives paycheck to paycheck, spending it all on buiyng more "toys" (e.g. dirtbike, jetboat, truck). Again, I'm not against buying nice things for yourself as long as you budget and save for the future. He once asked me (I'm in medical school), "What kind of STUFF are you going to buy once you are a doctor?" I told him that I was going to buy a house first of all, and he laughed and said, "NO. COOL stuff! Mercedes? Mustang?" He really doesn't understand that there are things to life other than money. He asked my boyfriend to go half and half on a mortgage so they could buy a house together. I did not give my opinion because I felt it was none of my business, but was secretly SO relieved when my boyfriend told him no. I think it's a terrible idea to enter into such a long-term financial commitment with someone who is hugely in debt and can't hold onto money even with a great paying job. Anyways... back to the beginning. I hate this person more than I've ever hated anyone. I haven't described the half of it because I want to keep this short enough for people to read, but I hope you can understand the situation. My question is... would this be a dealbreaker for anyone? Up until this point in the post I haven't talked about my relationship with my boyfriend, but let me just say it is INCREDIBLE. Amazing communication. Amazing sex. We are seriously perfect partners. He makes me laugh so much that I cry sometimes. But sometimes I imagine the future and I feel sick. His brother's financial habits seem to influence him somewhat. He isn't as terrible as Josh is, but he definitely doesn't save money. I am a huge saver (seeing as how I had to put myself through medical school) and I could see those mentalities conflicting. Also if we have kids one day... his brother will be their uncle. And I couldn't keep the kids away from his brother, that would be unfair to my boyfriend. So my hypothetical children would be influenced by this man (who trust me, will never change - he never wants to get married or have children, so he will always be that creepy uncle josh). I think it would be even worse if I had boys because he would want to do things with them and teach them his "techniques" with women. It makes me want to punch something imagining these children who don't even exist yet having to be around this man who I despise with a passion. So anyways. Despite this perfect relationship with my boyfriend, do you think this sort of thing (hating one of his family members so much) could ruin it? I know that typical answers on this thread are "end it, move on", but I would appreciate some input other than that because it's not realistic. It seems silly to end a great relationship because of someone who isn't even one of the members of the relationshp. It should just be about me and my boyfriend, right? At this point it's easy to ignore his brother as we're doing distance while I finish my last year of medical school. But at some point in the next year we will be hopefully living close by again and I will once more have to deal with his brother on a regular basis since they live together. And potentially deal with his brother for the rest of my life. This pains me. Any thoughts would be appreciated, especially if anyone has ever been in a similar circumstance!Summary:

Summarize: Hey guys! I'm currently in a fairly early Naga Transmuter of Cheibriados and I had a couple of questions since I know how easy it is to fuck up and die with a build like this. The Man : My main question is, how/should I go about getting into better armor? One of the main reasons I picked Chei is for the stat boosts in getting my utility spells online and being able to wear heavy armor while maintaining good EV/spell success. My armor skill is 12.5. How much higher does it need to go to mitigate the unarmed penalties? My main form of attack is blade hands right now, and I feel like having low attack delay and higher EV is better than having high AC/high attack delay. Also, how high should my unarmed be for reasonable attack delay with blade hands especially with plate armor? Also I really want some good armor because I have 10 scrolls of enchant armor, so I can make myself some incredible armor. I was planning on purchasing plate armor of fire resistance from Orc 4 and enchanting it to peak condition. That said, should I save a few (lets say 3) scrolls in case I skin a dragon or two in the vaults? The Plan : The second question I have is, where now? I have access to ignite poison (harder to cast in heavy armor but it's down to 21% in my artefact leather armor, keep in mind this is with 0 in fire) and I can get that online pretty easy. That said, my main offense is blade hands, and casting is harder with swords for arms. It is worth spamming ignite poison in Snake Pits before switching to Blade Hands? I don't have it purchased yet, but I do have access to an amulet of clarity for sirens and repel missles for projectiles, but I'm a bit worried about the shoals. Sirens suck when they skirt away from you, and I don't know if my spit poison will be able to get them before I get drowned by souls. Merfolk I'm fine with, I figure I can just temporal disturbance them until they get within blade hands range, but sirens move away from you. Also, I'm worried about movement in shoals. Flight has historically been my go to movement plan, but it is basically worthless to me since I move so damned slow flight runs out after 4-5 tiles of movement. I'm also a bit worried about the tide. I know this is pretty early into a run, but this type of build takes a lot of experience and skill (probably more than I have) but it's very powerful and unique and I don't want to muck it up. Thanks in advance!Summary:
Summarize: So, I am 26 and have an above-average penis size -- at least from what I have read in various publications. I'm a little over six inches, good girth, never had any problems with my tool. I've been in a relationship for the last eight months, give or take. My girlfriend is great, the love of my life. We get along amazingly and along with that comes the best sex of my life. Really, sex with her just keeps getting better and better -- and we do it a good amount. Some days we will have sex two or three times, but every time we are together (we don't currently share a residence) we usually fornicate at least one time. In the past couple months, my girlfriend keeps saying that my penis is getting bigger. I always say, "Ha ha, yeah right. I wish," but I am not a physiological expert nor am I one to just let things go and not think about it. Her reasoning is that nowadays, I get really hard all the time. My penis is like a cobblestone, or a jackhammer -- whichever you prefer. It's on another level and I am actually wondering, is my penis growing or is it just functioning at a sexual peak? My girlfriend must have a lot to do with this. I honestly don't masturbate all that much (couple times a week), but I have been having sex since I was 18 and I have never been this hard this often. My penis feels like a super penis, at least to me. So, is it crazy to suggest that a penis can grow after 26 years of living? It's almost like one of those things, when you hear it so much for so long, you start to wonder if it could actually be true. If I'm crazy for even thinking that, I would appreciate that feedback as well.Summary:

Summarize: I haven't really bought/stayed up to to date with new hardware for a while. Recently I've seen a lot of devices coming out that can fire at 100w, 150w, and (in the case of the Cloupor w/ firmware update) 200w. I've been using a mech setup with a dripper at around 0.16 ohms for a while now. So best case when I hit it on a fresh battery, I'm pulling a little bit over 100w I believe. Whats the attraction for these new mods? I can understand the 200w and 150w mods - more power. But when you're firing it that high, can you even really get a good vape? Or does the heat just kind of kill it? As for the 100 watt mods, I guess the attraction would be battery life and you could keep firing at 100w, rather than sinking down to the 80's as the battery loses charge. SoSummary:

Summarize: I've tried most of these "tips". But nothing actually works better, than having at least 5-8 hours of sleep, 6 being the sweet spot. You wake up feeling rested and you automatically just WANT to get up. Also don't turn on your lamp. Go from darker to lighter gradually, your eyes will hate if there's a bright light after solitude in darkness and you'll just hate everything and hide your head under the pillow and sleep in. If you wake up, open your eyes and stare at the ceiling or something, until you feel like your eyes are open, then you can turn on the light and proceed with morning activities. So if you're dead tired, and you only have 3 hours to sleep. I'd just recommend getting coffee or use some energizer and go in like a zombie and sleep properly the night after. Otherwise you're potentially risking on sleeping in, no matter what the trick is, in addition to not feeling rested. **Summary:
Summarize: I also had a similar incident when I was 3 years sober so I can provide you with my experience. There was a girl who came in that i was attracted to and knew it was a dangerous thing to get involved with someone newly sober. She got one of my friends to be her sponsor, and began hanging out in the same 'meeting after the meeting' crew as me. I tried to make sure that I was never alone with her, and strictly hung out with her in a group setting. I also felt the need to conceal these feelings from my fellows because of the 13th step stigma, but i think that was the worst thing i could have done. I felt guilty just for thinking and feeling these things, but the excitement of the idea was still appealing. So i kept my mouth shut and we hooked up the first time we were alone together. After that, the guilt multiplied and i felt horrible. It was the first time in a long time that i became uncomfortable with who i was. Meetings were unbearable. I felt distant and insecure. I got 'looks' that i interpreted as 'shame on you, you're disgusting'. After a few days, i finally decided to tell my sponsor. He was compassionate and caring as usual. He suggested that I quit beating myself up and focus on the solution. So we did. If I wasn't comfortable with the situation, then something needed to change. Her and I decided to break until she finished her 9th step. In that time, we were able to become friends. In the beginning, i would also get jealous when she rode around with other guys, or sat next to someone at dinner, which all revolved around my insecurities. She was not my property and could make her own decisions, even if they were decisions i didn't like. These are all very important things to consider before getting into a relationship with someone. If i am unable to handle situations like this, then i am not in a good place to begin a relationship. I watched as she worked the steps with her sponsor, and her life began to get better. I continued to be a part of aa and service, and my insecurities lessened. I was comfortable with who i was again. I think it's important to note that we did not do this perfectly. We had some 'slips' and they were always when i decided to leave my sponsor out of the decision making process, and those are the decisions i regret. I do not regret letting her focus on herself and figure out who she wants to be, no matter who she is with. Through this process, we both reached a point where our sponsors and friends were both supportive of our decision to try and be a couple. This is a decision i do not regret. We learned to be friends before being a couple, and it has been far better than any relationship I've had in the past. We communicate as friends and don't bicker like lovers. When we harm, we make it right. There are no hidden intentions or agendas. Suspicion is not a part of our lives together. Other girls i have crushed on and gotten to know first before pursuing a relationship, and all of those i do not have regrets about, and it eventually became apparent that it was just lust and nothing to do with their personality or anything that i would want long term. So, if any of that sounds like something you want, then try that.Summary:

Summarize: Background: We've been going out for a little longer than two years. We are both 18 and I'm the guy. I asked her out on her birthday since we were going to college together but lived in separate sides of the state. The first year was pretty magical but I guess it started to deteriorate. Yes, we fought a lot over stupid things and have broken up a few times but only for a few days. I don't have enough money to live on campus during the summers so I don't see her alot during the summer. I finally book a ticket to see her since I wanted to take her to the Cedar Point because its been her dream since she was little. A week later she breaks up with me since she's tired of all the fighting. I finally get it out of her later on that someone kissed her on the lips for three seconds but she didn't pull away. Obviously its just done right there and here I am ranting against it. She said she couldn't do it afterwards and was kicked the guys apartment apparently... i don't know the details since I didn't want to ever talk to her again. She still likes hanging out with him and plans to hang out with him still... I don't get how someone can just throw it all away. My question is how can people just throw away 2 years of their life so quickly? We were always together for each other, even if through the bad times... there were no signs of her ever liking anyone else... This is probably poorly written due to the rage burning inside me How can I get over this? What should I do if I ever see her on campus? My heart hurts so much... Did i react right by breaking all ties with her?Summary:
Summarize: I first met her a couple years ago working at a summer camp that I work at each summer. She's the type of girl that always has guy friends around her; not the typical girly girl. Last summer she helped me match up with my current roommate, who, coincidentally, had an apartment in the same complex as her. I've always had an attraction to her, but it was never more than a crush, until recently. As I've been spending more time with her, I've noticed so many commonalities that we share. We always get along so well. the thing is, I can't tell at all if she is seeing what I'm seeing. I like to think that I can read people and situations pretty well, but she's different. On Halloween, I offered to drive her back home to see her family since she doesn't own a car. It was a ton of fun, her family is crazy, and I got a lot of one on one time with her. Honestly, it was the most fun I've had on a Halloween in years (I associate that date with an ex-gf of mine so it's usually a day of bad memories for me). When we got back, we spent hours working on a puzzle (she loves puzzles that are just ridiculous, you should see this monstrosity on my table right now) and flirting. She left for the night because she had to get up early today for a flight, where she is visiting friends for the weekend. I'm going to ask her out this coming week, when she returns, but I don't know how to go about doing it. She's super busy all the time, because of her work and school, so I'm worried that I'll get turned down just because of that. Also, she's over at my apartment a lot because both my roommate and I are good friends with her, so I don't know how to make sure she knows I'm asking her out rather than just asking her to come hang with us. I haven't asked a girl out in just over six years, because I had a long-term girlfriend. I don't feel like I even know how to begin.Summary:
Summarize: I should probably post this in /r/Ihaveissues) Here's my extensive list: 1st date: (both of us 16) (This wasn't technically a relationship but it explains future ones.) Mr. Quarterback - 5'11", blonde, blue-eyed All American Boy. I was kind of an ugly duckling, so when my braces came off and I got a padded bra, I was thrilled to be going out with my long-time crush. He got handsy and I told him I wasn't going to give it up. The following Monday, he told the entire school that the reason he didn't get in my pants was because I stunk and had crabs. This was also the week in Biology that we studied crustaceans. This completely altered my high school experience. 1st BF: (both of us 16) Best Bud - 6'3" and Blonde. After my disastrous 1st date, I disappeared into myself and ended up hanging out with a group of goofy boys. Best Bud was sort of a loser and had a crush on me. I figured I was out of his league but he made me laugh and I didn't think he'd ever spread ugly rumors about me. <- teenage girl logic. He turned out to be a psychotic, insecure, controlling cheating liar (including a suicide attempt). I got pregnant at 17, married and divorced him at 18, married him again at 20, another child at 21, divorced again at 23. 2nd Husband: Okay. This is where it gets interesting. (Both of us 23) One-Armed Man - 5'9", looks like Macauly Culkin. After years of trying to leave my marriage, I made the drastic decision to cheat. My 1st husband always said if I ever cheated on him or if I'd even had sex before him that he would want nothing to do with me ever again. This sounded like the best news to me so I made a plan that included new underwear. I went out for my 23rd birthday with some gfs of mine and ran into the One-Armed Man. I'd known him for years, even before he lost his arm and had always thought he was cute. I was one Long Island Ice Tea in when I looked him straight in the eyes and asked him, "you want me don't you?". He said yes so we went and fucked in his car. That's about all we had in common. He was a hunter, obsessed with it, even. I am not and we didn't work out. Divorce... Marriage.... Divorce... Younger Man: (me: 25, him: 19) Mr. Unfriendzoned - 6'2", skinny balding brunette with blue eyes. Ian Somerhalder-y. After my final divorce, I decided to give up on relationships. I was sharing a big house with my oldest friend who'd also just gotten divorced. We both waited tables and tended bar, I babysat her daughter while she worked nights and she picked mine up from school/daycare in the afternoons. We had a pretty good set up. One day, she got her ex-bro-in-law hired as the dishwasher at the restaurant where we worked. He had just gotten out of the brig for possession so he also needed a place to stay. We rented a room out back to him and I became his ride. I already knew the kid through my bestie's ex-husband so it was cool. He was cute and he cracked me up and I admittedly enjoyed his crush on me. He talked me into smoking pot and we'd get high before work. Soon, our time spent together became more flirty and touchy and his persistence (arguably) paid off. We were best friends and lovers for close to 4 years after and are still friends. He was young, I was (am) immature. We had good times. Some drama unfolded during our relationship though. Turns out, while he was in the brig, his ex who lives in Alaska sent him a picture of an ultrasound and Mr. Unfriendzoned's parents were in the middle of a custody battle for the child. His parents won custody but soon after, moved the entire family about 12 hours away. Mr. Unfriendzoned had to go too. (longer story) White Knight: (me: 29, him: 31) Juicebox - 5"9', blonde, green eyes, muscles. Ugh....mistakes happen when you're depressed. Shortly after Mr. Unfriendzoned left, I found myself unemployed and sinking into depression. A friend of my mom's called me about applying for a job where she worked and also mentioned a single guy who worked with her. I told her it was cool to give him my number and within a week, I had a boyfriend and a job. Juicebox completely swept me off my feet...he might as well have been wearing a cape. He was all abercrombie-looking and it was obvious that he worked out. He made lots of money and took me on weekend getaways that included massages, tattoos, food and drinks...spoiled more than my trashy-ass could imagine. He was from another state, though and that made my controlling mother nervous. Since having children at a young age and being such a flibbertygibbit, I relied on my parents' support. My mother in particular, has an opinion on every single detail of my life and no matter what I'm doing, I should be doing something else. She means well, but I could never have gotten her approval, especially on my parenting skills. Anyway, while I was piecing my life back together with my new job and boyfriend, my mother was plotting with my ex-husband. She was scared that I would move 5 hours away with my 2 kids so she told my ex that she'd speak for him in court if he would file custody papers. At the time, I had a house a few doors down from my parents. My dad had co-signed the loan and they'd helped me out with a few payments before I'd started working again. Without going into too many more issues, let's just say that the idea of going to court against my mother was more than I thought I could take. I signed the custody papers without a fight and the next week when my parents' lawyer called me, I also signed over the deed to my house. Now homeless and childless, I moved 5 hours away with the Juicebox after knowing him for 3 months. The juicebox turned out to be a roid-raged liar and cheater. Online Bf #1: (Both of us 30) I'll call him The One because I've referenced him as that in other posts - 5'9" brunette, blue eyes. I saw The One holding a guitar in his profile pic on match.com and of course I had to contact him. We had the most perfect relationship: Talked online everyday, all day long, saw each other most weekends (he lives an hour away), our kids seemed to get along really well and he plays guitar!! I always had the feeling that he wouldn't like me when I'm angry. He is patient to a fault and a super responsible single father. He's also the cute, nerdy type that I have a soft spot for. He made a wall out of my name in Minecraft. <3 Everything was perfect until he "invited" my children and I on vacation with him and his kids. (I made a rage comic about it: please excuse all the "le"s used. I made it a while back) The day after we returned from vacation, he said, we "handle stress differently" and dumped me. This relationship has been the hardest for me to get over, I think, because The One is basically imaginary. Since we were a LDR, we didn't have to deal with each others' annoying habits. We didn't get tired of each other so it kind of made him unfairly perfect in my book. Online BF #2: (me: 32, him: 34) The Mighty Oak - 6'6", curly mustache, tattoos, gauged out ears. This poor, huge fella. Within a week of The One dumping me, I got laid off and slipped off into another depression. I was out of town getting a 13 tattooed, when The Mighty Oak, who's also a tattoo artist, contacted me on okcupid.com. An hour later, I got a job offer from a restaurant called The Black Cat...it all seemed like some kind of black fate to me so of course, I jumped on him. Literally. On our first date, I told him that I was wondering if I would be able to wrap my legs all the away around him...turns out, I could. I feel like, in retrospect, that I was like a tiny hurricane headed straight for him and he was weird enough to look forward to it. At one point, I said, "this is a bad idea but how about I move in with you and work in your studio?" and he agreed to it. Obviously, he has issues too. Three months into our relationship, The Mighty Oak hurt his back and it was up to me to take care of bills, home, cooking, children, and all the other stress that comes with being an adult. I broke. The Mighty Oak wasn't the sweetest of patients and I am no caretaker. We crashed into each other and didn't have any foundation. It seemed like we handled stress about the same way so I had to leave. We were both pretty ugly to each other. So that's my wall o'boyfriends. Hope this answered OP's question.Summary:
Summarize: Worms. I don't think you understand how deeply rooted this phobia is. I will go out of my way to change sidewalks if I see a worm in the street. If there is a worm in the room (or somewhere I can see) I MUST flee. I would miss a test, a job interview, a lottery prize if there was a worm near. I hate the beach because I could touch a worm when I'm barefoot in the sand. I literally cannot sleep if I think about a worm. I feel them creeping in my skin and must find something else to do. I cringe when I type or read the very word "worm". When the Yu-Gi-Oh! fad started, some of my friends gave me a deck for some secret santa, and I got the standard, basic Yugi deck. There was a worm warrior card with a very graphic image of a worm, which I immediately threw on the floor, picked it up in such a way that it would face against me so I could not see the drawing, and took it to the bathroom and burned it with a friend's lighter. I refused to give it away in the slim chance someone would use it in a game with me. In the fifth grade, a piece of the roof fell next to me*, and some larvae fell on my desk. Now, larvae aren't really worms, but I hate them all the same. In that same note, centipedes aren't worms either, and again, I hate the fuck out of them. So, this huge nest of larvae (as I remember it, my friends say it was just ONE larva that fell on my desk) fell on my desk, and I must have made some kind of record, because I didn't even know it and I was already outside of the room. The teacher was angry because she didn't know what had made me leave the classroom, but I explained and she calmed down. Which proved to be futile when she was enraged again when I refused to be in that classroom any more, even after they disposed of the larvae and offered me a new seat. They had to call in my parents to pick me up. When I was 13 or around that age, my cousin threw a worm on me. My cousin was a bitch. She knew I didn't like worms, but maybe she was just curious of how much I hated them. I screamed in some ear-breaking frequency, got it off me as if it were AIDS-infected blood on top of an open wound, and ran as fast as I could into the beach house. I had to cross a busy street to get to my house, but I didn't give a fuck about being killed. When I got into the house I found some hose and scrubbed the place it touched me until I drew blood in some sort of obsessive Macbeth-like washing panic. And I only stopped because my parents found me there, hyperventilating and scratching at my torso like a madman.Summary:

Summarize: First, you do realize that you are the one slandering him and he kept his views on your racism private and just banned you and only mentioned it in mod mail when you asked why he banned you, right? Do you feel a tad hypocritical. This guys an ass, but he just banned you, you've obsessively stalked him. Second, I can't read the post since you didn't link to it, but the title does sound racist. Why mention that someone of African descent attacked the girl? Why not just say a girl was attacked for wearing a crucifix? Does it actually matter that it was by someone of "African descent?" Also, do you realize that "African descent" is almost always not the right way to refer to a black person unless you're referring to someone who literally migrated from Africa in their lifetime and are acting in a way informed by that? Giving you the benefit of the doubt I'd imagine it's just a misstep, but realize that specifically calling out race is race-bating a bit when it has nothing to do with it. Why not call out the other kids religion? This is like saying the girl was attacked by someone of Irish descent...unless it's a protestant/Catholic English/Irish related attack it serves no fucking purpose. You should ask yourself why you'd mention someone of African descent and not if they were of Irish descent.Summary:
Summarize: ok, this is the first player of a four man premade i got paired with, the vi, after 5 minutes, complained i never ganked top and called me fu**er. so i refused to gank top due to the fact im not helping someone who is gonna call me names and say stuff like that. Later on in the game she /all chat to the other team to report me for being racist, flaming and raging when i did nothing. she said i spoke about hitler or something. when i said nothing to her all game. The next player was the lux. I tried ganking her lane a couple of times but it didnt work out. she persistenltly called me a noob. so i refused to gank her lane due to the same reasons as before. throughout the rest of the game she called me a noob and a feeder. even though i was 1-0-3. she complained i never ganked any lane even though i got bot lane a double kill twice. the bot lane didnt say anything to me. it was a four man premade, i checked lolnexus to make sure. to be honest. this has happened to me before. it makes me mad and completely ruins my experience of this game. its people like this that make me wanna quit this game altogether. why should other people have the ability to make me feel this way. its not fair. why should they take the enjoyment out of this game for me? if these two players dont get banned then there is something wrong with the tribunal. so the main thing im saying is that solo q players should NOT be paired with a four man premade. it ruins the whole bloody game when four people who are completely WRONG can seem right due to the fact that they have everyone defending them. they can pick on you and make you feel like dirt even though they are lying and you have done nothing wrong. it happens frequently. get rid of four man premade altogether. make it 2,3 or 5 man only. that way you can always have a friend with you to back you up when people try to pick on you for their own mistakes. DONT PAIR SOLO PLAYERS WITH PREMADES! its not fair. my day is ruined. thanks riot, thanks vi, thanks lux. i just want it so that if someone queue's on their own, they will ALWAYS be with 4 other solo queuers. if two people q up. they will be paired with a three man premade (and vica-versa). if 5 q up then they should be AGAINST another 5 which is already what is happening right now. its SO stupid to be paired up with a four man premade.Summary:
Summarize: I knew this kid back in middle school through high school. His first time masturbating was in the shower, he used shampoo as lube and it got in his eyes he slipped in the shower clinging to the shower curtain as he fell ripping it and the pole it was off breaking them and then banged his head on the tub. To top it all off his mom came in because of all the loud noises to find him covered in blood with sudsies in his eyes and his lubed up dick in his hand.Summary:
Summarize: I came to terms just how toxic my mother was this past year. I've all but removed her from my life but I won't cut the ties completely for the sake of my siblings and keeping thing cordial for their life events; I'm honestly not sure I want her there for my life events and it hurts to type that but the truth is that she is very much a trigger for me and I don't want anymore lies or forced smiles headed my way. I'm going to work my way backwards a bit a hit the major displays of negative behavior or what I perceive as negative in my personal experience. This does not include what my siblings have gone through because that gets....really personal and it's not my place to say but they certainly cement this view in my mind about her. My college graduation. My mother, father, stepmother, sister, brother, boyfriend, aunt, and 2 of my high school friends all travel to my location for the occasion. My mother's friend decides to invite herself along and my mother turns it around on me when I ask her why this friend is coming that, "Oh YOU invited her with your Facebook event page" - what I did was place an event up on Facebook and invite all my FB friends to the page to say thank you and share the event pictures, I did not invite everyone to actually come as those people received card invitations. Not only does this friend come but my mother leaves with her in the middle of photo taking to go buy shoes....yeah. Now she's angry with me because we don't have many photos together after the ceremony because she left. She also makes the celebration dinner very awkward by bringing a TON of gas station gifts to the table and more gifts back at my place because my father bought me a small bouquet of flowers. Oh, she also leaves to go to Florida with the self-inviting friend and go fishing.. on a trip where she said it would be about us... She went insane and started berating me and cursing me out on Facebook when a group conversation turned into her bashing my father to her sister. I asked her to move it to a private location and she made a snippy comment about my father and I asked her again to do it and mind that he never spoke about her this way in front of us so she should show the same courtesy. It turned into a month long verbal war and she still hasn't apologized. She NEVER apologizes for anything and always takes the victim stance. She once tried to use the "your father cheated on me" card to which I responded that I knew of 2 instances where she did cheat on my dad but I've never seen him show these behaviors. I didn't discredit the accusation I was merely saying that she needed to stop displaying it in front of me and my younger sibling, I'm now the daughter that calls her a whore and her boyfriend chastised me. My mother lives overseas and I don't get over there often (or at all) because of the fare costs. I did go over once, it put me in the red financially and my apartment lease in jeopardy because instead of giving me the money to help with that like she said she would, she spent it on Christmas gifts. This was after I stated that we WON'T be exchanging gifts, the trip is the gift and I just want time with her. I left her house when I was 18, at 26 I still haven't received any of my belongings and she left my cat behind when she moved away..right before I got the money to fly him over and AFTER I got her another cat to keep her company. She still has the cat I got her. High school graduation. I found out my parents were getting a divorce; she had been dating a man for an entire year beforehand (I had no idea how to handle the situation...none) and my father found out they were getting a divorce the same day I did. Throughout my senior year I lived at my friend's house because she was never home and the only way I was getting fed or any social interaction was by the kindness of my friend's mother. This mother is also married to the man my mother tempted to run away with. Nearly destroyed the greatest friendship I had and nearly ruined two families. My mother admitted to me that if she could do it all over again she would never have had children, she would have gone to music school. She took all the cash I had saved up for prom and spent it. It took several arguments to get anything back to pay for the dress, my hair and makeup had to be done by myself (which I had 0 idea on how to do) because she forgot to make the salon appointment. She also left before seeing me and my date off so she could be with her boyfriend. I had to set the camera up on a table with a timer to get a photo. My mother promises that my father will move overseas with us as soon as he finds a job there. He does and she tells him not to come (this was before I found out about the boyfriend) because I'll be graduating soon and need someone in the states to help me for college. My mother sent my away on the weekend's to my friend's house with a bundle of cash. We hardly spent a weekend together. My mother kept taking me out of school and I thought it was great at the time because I had anxiety and depression issues, I came to realize it was to keep her company when she should have helped me overcome it. My mother sat me down and told me she and my Dad were getting divorced when he came back from deployment because it wasn't working out. He came back and the subject was never brought up again. My mother would tell embarrassing stories about me at her workplace that reached my school and she wouldn't stop after several pleas because it helped her career though it killed my social life. She'd forget about picking me up on several occasions so I'd be left waiting until dinner time when the family realized I wasn't at the table. I couldn't call my Dad because his work wouldn't allow personal calls. I felt the need to post this because it's still very much a sore point in my life and she's such a trigger. It's so frustrating because my siblings still maintain a relationship with her so I have to hear about what she did now and I don't want my relationship with them to be fueled by her. It's also so hard because recently she came to me saying that I was "distancing myself from the family" and I explained that I'm not, that I speak almost daily with my one sibling and at least once a week with the other (who has a crazy work schedule). She said that it feels like she's been distanced and I explained that she's doing that to herself by being the only member overseas where it's difficult to visit, expensive to call and she never gets online to chat or if she does she'll spend 2 minutes there then rush off when the conversation gets off of her passion (she ONLY talks about theater and no one else has any relation or interest in it). She won't accept that she's doing it to herself so once again I'm the horrible daughter doing it. I'm done. My relationship with my brother, sister and father are stronger than ever. I spent so much of my childhood trying to keep us altogether, I clung SO TIGHTLY to everyone because I was so alone and they ignored me. Now we've finally come back together and it's not the traditional family structure but it's perfect for us and she tries to destroy it. She's a trigger for me, my brother and my sister and I will be DAMNED if she ruins any of their life events.Summary:

Summarize: This will get buried, but once when I was about 25, my stepdad and I were on our way home in the last hour stretch of a road trip in his old beater of a pickup truck. My mom had been waiting up for us, and I think it was about 12:30 in the morning when we realized that we were about to run out of gas. We called AAA and they said they'd locate us and bring us some gas within the hour. As such, we pulled over and decided to call my mom to let her know we were going to be late. Then, my stepdad had the bright idea of playing a prank on her just to see what she would do. When I asked him what to say, he said "I don't know, just make something up!" So, I put my phone on speaker and dialed the number to my parents' house. She answered the phone and asked how everything was going. Said we needed to hurry up because she was tired of waiting and wanted to go to bed. Blah blah blah, bullshit for a minute, until I tell her "oh, we're going to be a little late because we ran out of gas and are waiting for AAA to show up." She asks what happened and we say we just misjudged how much gas it would take to get home, and forgot to stop at an appropriate point before there wouldn't be anymore gas stations for awhile. She flips out a little bit, asking if we're okay, which is normal I guess for moms who are just waiting for the rest of their family to join them safely in the nest. She was concerned about how much food and water we had, in case we had to sleep there all night (?? I don't even know), and during her billions of questions, it dawned on me: I told her -- "Mom, we're going to be fine. AAA said they'd be here in about 45 minutes, and that's plenty of time before the oxygen in the cab runs out. My stepdad crammed his fist in his mouth as best he could to stifle his laughter, because my mom audibly gasped and said "WHAAAT?? How long does that usually take?". So, I ran with it and said "It depends on the make and model of the vehicle, but since this is an old truck, it has a failsafe mechanism that when the gas tank is emptied, all the windows and doors lock and seal so they can't be opened. At some point that means that if there are people inside, they'll run out of air. We're guessing we have about 90 minutes before we should start getting worried." At this point, she is totally crying and we are barely able to contain our cackling, because she starts giving us tearful, desperate tips on how to conserve oxygen: "Try to take slow, shallow breaths! Or go to sleep!" "Don't talk on the phone too long or you'll use up the oxygen faster!" "If worse comes to worst, just break the window!" Anyway, by the end of it she's hysterically crying and begging to talk to my stepdad, since she believes it's possible it'll be the last time she ever talks to him. Tears are absolutely rolling down his face, and he does his best to regain his composure long enough to pretend like he's really worried and will really miss her if anything bad happens. He starts telling her how much he loves her and has been thankful for all the years they've spent together, that she changed his life and he could never love anyone else as much as her. I am positively DYING by this point, because he's incorporated a skillful wheeze into the conversation after every other word, which is serving the dual purpose of driving my mom completely batshit with worry and myself deeper into the throes of laughter. After about 20 minutes of them having this super heartfelt conversation, the AAA guy shows up. My stepdad, without thinking, rolls down the window to talk to the guy, and my mom could hear it happening over the phone. All of a sudden she screams "WHAT THE FUCK?!" and my stepdad and I are completely helpless to the power of how funny it was. We burst out laughing so hard and tried to breathlessly explain what we told her to the AAA guy, who also started laughing. After she heard that, she was PISSED. She started screaming obscenities at us and told us not to even bother coming home because she would call the police. When we finally got there, she had taken all of the winter boots and shoes out of the hall closet, scattered them all over the foyer, and turned all the lights off so that we'd trip over them and fall on our faces when we got in the door. It has never, ever stopped being the funniest thing that has ever happened to our family. There were other incidents too, just not as good as that one. She didn't talk to either of us for a week after that. It was hilarious.Summary:
Summarize: Let me start off by stating: I am a Republican. But my conservatism goes only as far as the economic policy and the ideology of government who only steps in when laws are broken. I dont agree with how many republicans justify their political stances with religious ideas. For example, I am against gay marriage, just because I personally feel like it is wrong. This does not mean that I would do anything against those who are gay. Some republicans are against gay marriage because they say the Bible says it is wrong. Basing laws off Biblical morals I think is a violation of the separation of church and state which I feel alienates many people who might support the pure political aspect of conservatism but are held back the idea of legislated morality. This is not meant to be inflammatory, I am just stating what I think. If you feel that I am wrong, please let me know why. I would like this to be civilized and not reiterate the ass raping I got when I challenged someones ideas in /r/liberal.Summary:

Summarize: I don't feel petty about it, it just seemed justified. My team mates trusted another guy from class and decided to work with him. He later on back stabbed us and copied our idea and even the guest we were going to use. But we didn't bother with him and actually reworked our concept, shot it and got better results than our old script. Our planning was bang on and we were able to utilize the newly bought HD Cameras. They're quite difficult to configure if you're not familiar with settings and we booked them a week ago. Once our shoot was finished his group demanded to get access to the same cameras even though we did the hard work and actually did the paper work to get them, he bullied his way into it. So, before handing them the equipment, I changed the recording settings and other hidden controls and handed the equipment back. For anyone competent enough rolling back the changes wouldn't be an issue. But considering what they're capable off, they would now be shooting in Standard Definition while the Camera is easily capable of HQ HD. And the image would be off balance and stretched. The superintended even asked me to revert the changes and I just removed few changes and handed it back. And I told him I was practicing with the camera hence the weird settings. I think he bought the story. In any case they're still trying to shoot using the cameras.Summary:
Summarize: It was kind of a bittersweet meet up honestly. Definitely not anything special or at all what we had discussed, but not exactly a disaster either. I'm not sure how to tell this story so I'm just going to start... My birthday is this month and he had been discussing what he wanted to do for/to me. How he wanted to just make the day all about my pleasure, sort of like the first time we slept together. He told me he got massage oil and and had been telling me he couldn't wait to get his hands on me, to tease me, and to taste me. That he wouldn't let me have his cock until I came for him. On his lips. That plan definitely went out the window. When I walked in he wrapped his arms around me and kissed me. My lips, my ears, my neck, and I was doing the same. Before I knew it he picked me up, my legs were wrapped around him, and he carried me to the desk. My dress was up around my hips and I could feel how hard he was through my thin tights. He pulled each of my legs up to his chest, running his hands the entire length, to remove my shoes as I laid back. I thought he was going to take me right there but we made it to the bed. We barely made it to the bed. He was pulling my tights off and on top of me in seconds. He left my panties on to tease me, letting me feel his hard cock against me. I reached down an pushed my panties aside and with one firm thrust I had all of him. That first moment always feels amazing. I feel so full, so tight around him. He fucked me like that, half of our clothes still on, moaning into my ear and neck, until he came. We relaxed still wrapped up in each other before finally stripping off the rest of our sweaty clothes and having a drink. We had somehow knocked the box of chocolates off the bed and wasted half of them. He laughed about how I ruined his plan and I told him there was still time. As we were talking and laughing and grazing what was left of the candy we we ended up discussing his wife and how jealous she is of one of their single neighbors and an invasion of his privacy that she did recently. I didn't know what to say and half hoped he wasn't making it up because of our communication talk recently (which we came to an agreement on anyway) and half hoped he was because it was a little crazy. Despite that awkward moment he soon had his hands on me again. I was the little spoon and he was caressing my body. Running his fingertips down my side, over my ass, gently kissing the back of my neck and nibbling my shoulder, until his fingers found their way between my thighs. He growled into my ear, mmm, as he does, "you're so wet for me" and I moved my ass against him so he could get inside me. I responded with a soft moan and told him I wanted him. He kept massaging my clit with his figers, his other hand across my chest holding me close, as he slowly but firmly pushed himself into me over and over, sending little waves of pleasure throughout my body. I could hear his breath quicken, even over my own noises, feel it against my neck. I was pushing back against him, my legs trembling, mumbling incoherent "yes"s between moans as he kept his pace. The perfect pace. As I started to cum he forced himself as deep as he could get and held his cock there, his fingers making just the right movements to take me over the edge, the arm over my chest held me tightly as I shook. After enjoying that for a few moments I rolled back against him, throwing a leg on each side, without losing his cock I was riding him backwards. This always makes me laugh a little because it reminds me of the "crab walk" game in elementary school. So, as I can't believe that is sexy, I sat up into reverse cowgirl. He loves looking at my ass and squeezing it and seeing me take him in. After what I believed was a good workout I hopped off and wrapped my mouth around him. I sucked all of my juices off of him. But I could only go so long wothout it and I started riding him again, leaning over to nibble his ears. The way he was grabbing me, the almost grunts I could hear, I knew he wanted it harder so I gave it to him, but before long he had me on my back again, with a pillow underneath me and my legs over his shoulders. He knows I love this, the slow deep thrusts and the way it makes his pelvis rub against my clit. It wasn't long befire my knees were buckling again and he started riding me hard, pushing my body towards the edge of the bed. By the time we finished my head and shoulders were hanging off. We didn't notice this but the clock in the room was an hour ahead so we didn't think we had much time afterward. We layed there relaxing and laughing and snuggling until he got into the shower. I watched him get dressed longingly and he came back to bed. It is always so hard for either of us to leave, and he started teasing me again. He was kissing my neck, which drives me crazy, and I alid his hand between my legs to show him exactly how crazy. Once he felt how badly I wanted him he started using thise fingers. Moaning and writhing he asked "can I make you cum like this?". I had to be honest. The answer was no. No one can, I barely can make it work myself. So he left me like that! All worked up wth no release. . . . . .Summary:
Summarize: A couple years back I was traveling Europe as part of a Contiki tour, I was doing two tours back to back with 1 week in between the two. If you hadn't heard about Contiki it has been said to be a sex romp where everyone is there for a no strings attached good time.... in other words sex to you can't sex no more. The tour started in London and this is where the meet was for the first tour, I was traveling alone and am generally a shy bloke but everyone was friendly and there were other single travelers so I didn't feel as alone. We went through the meet and greet and everyone was cool, there were some great looking woman in the group but the two that stood out the most were these two Asian twins from Mexico, they were the talk of the group from both the men and woman and they had the accent to match their looks. I spoke to them briefly at the start and they were very chill, they were just there to sight see and take in the different cultures and spend time together as they both study in different locations. As the tour went on I became friendly with both, they both came across as very innocent and nice girls, I didn't think I had a shot and even if I did they were always close together, like they never left each others sight, always stayed in the same room as each other so there was never a chance for me or anyone else to attempt to make a move. In the group they were the only ones not getting down and dirty. Anyways, the 1st of my tours (2 week tour) was ending and everyone became pretty close to each other sharing such a great experience, it was pretty emotional knowing I won't be seeing any of these people again. As I was saying bye to the twins one of the twins said we've got a bit more time free then expected so we're thinking of continuing on after they visit Spain, she said she heard I was doing a Greece tour and asked for details and said I might see them there. I wasn't sure if they were going to show and I was impartial either way as it would be nice to know someone from the start and I didn't think I'll get anything so they could potentially end up being just cock blocks. Skip ahead 1 week, tour time comes and they are there.... hugs, nice to see you gals again, they were looking cuter than ever as they spent their week in the sun getting an amazing look tan... meet the rest of the group everyone seems cool. The tour was great and the twins were sociable but avoiding the extra "interactions", heaps of guys on the tour tried but didn't succeed. Skip ahead and it was our last night as a group together, Contiki had setup a private function party for us and another tour in one of the Halls on the Ship... It was all going pretty normal until I seen the twins skulling shots, I got a laugh out of it as I didn't expect it and just continued on outside talking to a couple girls from another tour I'd just met. The girls I just met were being very flirtatious and we were having a good laugh.....then one of the twins walked up to me mid conversation, sat in my lap and whispered, I want to see your cock tonight and walked away..... my eyes lit up, I was surprised and overly excited, the other girls asked me what she said I just nodded not paying attention to what they were saying but more focused on what do I do now, I was sitting there in a state of disbelief, I snapped out of it and had that confidence of knowing my night is sorted. Five minutes later the other twin walked up to me, then looked at the girls I was talking to and said he's mine tonight and walked away. WTFFFF the girls could not stop laughing, they were switching between shock that this little Asian bitch (In their words) had just tried to put it over them but at the same time laughing and saying props to the girl for claiming her intentions.... in the middle of all the laughing they realized that the it was a twin and not the same girl that had sat in my lap earlier and whispered something in my ear and then pushed me to tell them what. I told them and they were near pissing themselves, so much so that one of them had to cross her legs and lean forward. I was stumped, I had threesome with hot Asian twins screaming inside my head, that's something I had only ever imagined of typing into google. The girls I was talking to could not stop laughing and I have to say extremely cool as they knew I was in a unique predicament, they calmed down and gave me a bit of banter but were trying to give me advice on how to obtain the best possible scenario.. being a threesome ofc. I told them i don't think it's possible but I'll love it to be but would hate to think that if I hit them up for it they will both be disgusted and tell me to fuck off and I'll end up with neither. It was decided I should walk up to them when they are both alone together as ask, who's up for a good time in a joking manner, that way If it's on I will know if it's not I will know and would not have ruined the chance. The twins had made their way outside and were sitting by themselves, I walked up to them and sat near them and said who's up for some fun tonight.... lol they both instantly gave me the look of a cute smile which said me but....shhh and changed the topic, that pretty much answered my question. I stayed and sat with them and we were having an innocent conversation, each time i tried to steer in another direction one of them will change the subject. All while each was giving me smiles which were smiles I hadn't seen before and one was rubbing my leg under the table. I was in a state of mind fuck and was getting pretty frustrated with it all as they both were keen but were trying to keep it a secret from their sister. I told the girls I was going to get a drinks and asked if one of them wanted to help me carry since I only had two hands, it was a plan to get them separated, once of them popped up and said I will. We went to the bar and I told the twin that came with me, you know I only came to get a drink to get you separated from your sister, she had a laugh and said yeah I've been waiting for you to make a move, I told her well it's hard when you both have glue for clothing, I thought it was a lame joke but she found it funny.... she then said, what if it was my sister that offered the help lol I was thinking we would be having the same conversation but I told her I would have had to think of something different. I then told her I find her crazy sexy but this level of tease isn't healthy, is something going to happen? She said I hope so and then told me once we get back to the table, she's going to play of tipsy and ask her sister to stay out and enjoy her night, she told me her room number and then told me to meet her there. Boom, that sounds like a solid plan. We make it back to the table, have a couple drinks and as planned she says sorry guys I feel pretty tipsy, I'm to have a early one. Her sister asked if she was ok but was looked pretty excited by all this and told her she was going to stay up for a while and to call if she needed anything. Helping hand twin began to walk away, and before I could think of how to get myself following her. The other twin told me, how far is your room and grabbed me. They both had a switch that went from innocent to bad girl, it was such a turn on. I felt guilty but what was I to do, I wasn't going to tell her sorry I can't your sister is faking head spins in hopes to separate from you to sleep with me. We ended up going back to the room, It was magic but I had some guilt in the back of my mind... I was thinking what the fuck is her sister thinking, does she know? We went at it for around an hour between foreplay and solid action. We had some post sex talk, and laughs and I then jumped in the shower and when I was done she had fallen asleep. I changed my underwear and threw on the same clothes and went back out and joined the others, I told the girls I was speaking with at the start what had happened... I was the highlight of their night, they couldn't stop laughing and I told them that the helping hand one could still be waiting for me and joked that I should go, and didn't plan on going as I'm sure she would either be pissed off, know what happened or most likely be asleep. They told me I better go and If i didn't then it will be slack to her, and kept saying better late then never and what's the worst that could happen. I think they just pressured me so that can have this random story to tell their friends. I ended up going, scared to knock on the door but I did and she was ready, she didn't ask or want to hear what took me so long but was she was very happy I came. It was amazing, even though I was tired they were both very special girls that gave me a night never to forget.... She told me I better leave before her sister got back, which i did and then got back to my room as her sister was getting dressed, gave me a kiss and said I better get back to my room before my sister wakes up.Summary:
Summarize: Way back when, a buddy I had recently graduated from high school with became a ex friend. This ex friend started going to raves and eating whatever drugs he could find, eventually he got ditched at a rave and ended up eating 2 drops of acid for the first time while alone. Well, he had a really bad trip and sorta messed up his head to some extent. A few days later, a mutual friend's mother called his home lookng for her son (this was right before everyone and their dogs started owning a cellphone), and he decided to break down and confess than he and her son were doing lots of drugs at rave. Funny thing was that these two didn't go to that many raves together, and certainly wasn't part of the group of people who ditched him. Shit sorta hit the fan, our mutual friend ended up getting tossed out of his house. She made calls to a few other friends parents. I personally had not been attending these raves, I didn't like the music, wasn't interested in the wide variety of drugs available, and didn't want to spend all night around such things. Next thing I know, I am being asked questions about raves and drugs that I knew little to nothing about. While I told the truth, I had never gone to a rave or eaten the various "rave drugs", those asking didn't believe me. Relations with my mom were damaged to some extent, and it took a long time to earn trust and respect again. Meanwhile, he continued to go to raves and eat drugs, while many of his friends were kicked out, had to drop out of college, or ended up forced into rehab.Summary:
Summarize: Sorry for the wall of text, thank you to all who read and give their input So a few weeks ago friends and I went to the local bar where we are local regulars and stayed for a few hours, we all left together to go smoke cigars. I came back after an hour or 2 to meet up with a girl I knew, we went in and the cocktail waitress was working, her and I started up a conversation and she pulled up a chair and we kept talking while the girl I was with just got out her phone and started texting. We talked about a local brewery and their beer. I felt bad so I ended the convo and turned back to the girl I brought. We later left girl I brought asked me to come home with her but since I wouldn't have a ride home in the morning I declined Went back to the same bar the next week and started talking to the cocktail waitress again. Walked in and was met with other regulars that all got up and gave me hugs etc. One of her coworkers was off for the night but in to have a few drinks asked me to dance so got up in the middle of the crowded bar and danced for a few mins before sitting back down. As the night ended I asked the waitress when we were going to have the beers we talked about the weekend before. She vanished into the bars kitchen for a second and came back with a piece of paper with her schedule on it, so I handed her my phone and got her name/number. Texted her about 20 mins later saying it was me and she texted back when she got off how I made her night better. There was small chat through text the next day set up a date on monday for thursday of last week. Her texts are always slow which is fine just different than what normally happens. Fast forward to Thursday I show up to pick her up from work about 10 mins early, sit in the back pull out my phone and jump on reddit. She gets my attention and has me sit by her while she finishes up her shift. Go out to dinner and it was awesome, Sat at dinner had steady conversation about everything, eye contact, kino the whole works. Get done with dinner ask her if she wants to go out, she does. Wants to go back to the bar where she works (think this is to test me to see if i can handle the attention she gets since it was a busy night at the bar) We stop by her place so she can change out of her work clothes, met her sister. On the way to the bar she talks about how she can cook all my fav food and wants to. Went to the bar talked to her friends and regulars. Walking in I let her go up to the bar and grab a seat while i stood and talked to one of her regulars about sports then came up and sat next to her. At the bar she said the guy next to her creeped her out so i pulled her closer to me, when i left and came back squeezed her shoulders as i cut in and she gave me that omg dont stop look. Anyways we leave around midnight her and her friend are going to another bar and I declined since I had to work at 5 and had a 30 min drive home. She gave me a hug and as I pulled away she kept her arms tight and looked up at me and I tilted my head she mirrored me. Think I could of went for a goodnight kiss but didnt since half of her coworkers were out on break and I went out with one of them and she was hating on me all night. So this is where I get confused I texted her the next day about how I had a great night and I'm excited to try her cooking. Heard nothing back until I went up there and we ran into her on break outside the bar She smiled and waved but no one wanted to pay cover so we kept going then she started texting me about how we should fix this food craving I was having lol So as the night goes on I get a little sloppy and we start texting back and forth pretty quickly no more hour long waiting periods for her to respond. Talk about how I am going back up at 5 to tailgate the football game and I should try to wake her up to come along with us. Texted her around 10 never heard from her then my phone died and when I got it charged I had a missed text from her. From then on havent really talked Tried to set up a date for tonight on monday said she would check her schedule, then she had to close so I asked when she didnt have to close and havent gotten a response back from her since. I know I will see her at the bar this weekend and I am really into her, shes one of the coolest girls I've metSummary:
Summarize: He's a troll. Look through the full two days of comments he's made and it is crystal clear. Hell, just look at his name. And should he actually be from Texas, which I doubt, then I apologize on behalf of the rest of Texas. It is clear someone moved a rock somewhere and this slithered out. Your average Texan does not hold such ridiculously ignorant views. We are generally a progressive, accepting people. The problem comes from the fact that those progressive, accepting people don't go around shouting their views or trying to force their views on others. We are typically live and let live. But those that hold toxic views feel the need to spread those toxins. They do so in the most obnoxious and disputable ways and that unfortunately leaves the rests of us looking bad, too. Now, do we have assholes? Of course! Texas is 268,500 square miles or 695,621 square kilometers and we border four states. Assholes are bound to happen.Summary:
Summarize: I have been with this girl for almost 4 months, and I have stronger feelings for her than I ever have for anyone else. We were friends for a while, and I was honestly an asshole to her. I would lead her on for a while before breaking it off suddenly and chasing some school whore, before repeating the cycle. But I finally decided to date her after asking her to prom, and it's been the best (almost) 4 months of my life. And so, I have huge regrets about the way I treated her before sometimes. And she tells me it's okay and that all that matters is where we are now, but I just cannot forgive myself. I've noticed more and more that when I am talking to her, I read way too much into things. I constantly question in my head whether or not she is mad at me, and I apologize for nearly everything if I get even the slightest hint that she may be mad. But the thing is, she's never once been angry with me. Sometimes I might say some things that will frustrate her a little and she will tell me, and my first thought is to begin apologizing. It's like I lose all sense of dignity, and just do my best to keep her from being angry with me. I can't stand myself when I do this, and I don't know why I can't help it. It's like when I talk to her, I watch what I say to prevent her from being mad at me (she doesn't notice that I do this) rather than just speaking freely and honestly like one should in a healthy relationship. Also, if it's significant: I've had several relationships/attempts at relationships before this one, and they have all ended in an awful way. It would take me another post entirely to explain even one of them. But the moral is that in all of my past relationships, whoever my girlfriend was would get mad at me, and for 99% of the time I wouldn't know why. I would always thing I did something wrong, and apologize for nothing in particular (just with the intention of making it up to them somehow), even though they would stay just as angry at me. This would always make me feel awful, especially about myself. Looking back on it now, I feel like that was its own type of abuse. I feel like this is a question I shouldn't even have to be asking. Can anyone relate to this? Any advice would be greatly appreciated as well.Summary:
Summarize: Hey, guys Sorry for all the information I'm about to give you. I just really want some help from people who know all the facts. I am 21f and my boyfriend is 22m. We go to the same college, and have been dating for over a year, and we live together. When we first started dating, we had sex a lot. It seems like everyday that we hung out ended in sex. It was awesome. Things started to slow down a little bit a few months ago. When we started living together... He is a Christian dude, except not very extreme. He turned to religion when his mom passed away last year. He was "saved" at a church camp he chaperoned over last summer, and is truly believing and passionate about God. He used to sometimes cry and say he wished I would just be "saved." I've told him that I feel silly about it and that I'm just not ready for it. So he has put it behind. I go to church with him and never try to disrespect what he believes and we are both okay with that. Except when it comes to sex. I am on birth control. It has been 2 years since I had an implanon put in. I never get a period. At first my sex drive was extremely decreased. I went a year without sex and was completely okay. But now my sex drive is through the roof. I constantly think about sex and am always horny and ready to go! Me and my boyfriend have great sex and I love it. The only problem is now that he won't have sex with me. The first month we lived together, our sex was normal as ever. It was everyday and sometimes twice a day. Now it is once every two weeks if I am lucky. Every time I try to prompt sex with him, he says that we do it too much and he is "straying from the lord." He will keep saying this until he reaches the brink of his horniness I guess. Then he'll have me give him a super quick blow job, but no sex usually. And that makes me all the more horny. But he never messes around with me or anything. I feel like he looks down on me for being so weak/horny. I have to beg and beg for him to have sex with me, but he will never give in until he wants it. And I can't deny him when he wants it, because I already want it so bad. He says all I care about in our relationship is sex, but it's not true. It just builds up inside and it's all I can think about. I feel like a horny man or something. Like other girls aren't like this. He says the devil is tempting me and I need to speak with God. I don't agree. He will have a HUGE boner that I can feel whenever I'm trying to seduce him, but he will still say no to me! I don't get it. Why is it so hard for him to do? :/ I also find that I masturbate way too much. It can be from at least 3 to 10 times a day. :( It doesn't even calm down my sex drive. At all. I just keep going and going. After sex though, I feel relieved and 'finished.' I can achieve an orgasm through masturbation, but I never feel finished, and can go right back to masturbating a minute later. I'm so embarrassed about it, and he doesn't even know I do it. He doesn't masturbate, (unless he somehow does it at work) because I am with him all the time at home. We shower together, sleep in the same bed, and everything. He will have a boner in the shower and won't let me anywhere near it. I just don't get it at all. Am I pushing him? I feel like if genders were reversed here, it would be really bad. I just don't know how to calm myself down. What should I do??? Other than our sex life, our relationship is amazing. He is everything I ever wanted, and I love him with all my heart. He makes me soooo happy, and I definitely do not want to end things with him over this. He doesn't want to get married until he has finished college and has a steady job. He wants to have a huge church wedding or something and be financially stable. That could be 4+ years before anything like that happens. I've suggested no sex at all until then if it makes him uncomfortable and he said "WHAT! No? I just mean we need to slow down. Not stop." But he doesn't realize that I'm not getting anything. So if this all has to be slow "until marriage" is it going to get worse? How should I talk to him? It's very embarrassing to me, because I'm very shy, especially about sex. So I don't know how to approach this. Especially when he gets all Christian on me. Side note - If it is my birth control that has driven me to being a nymphomaniac, it won't be another year until it is removed. But I'm not sure if it is the cause or not. If so does anyone know a way to counter it or decrease my sex drive?Summary:
Summarize: Let's be honest here, even though we're all atheists, it kind of sucks that once we die, we merely cease to exist. How awesome would it be if sometime in the future they were able to "upload" our consciousness onto some type computer program with a "virtual heaven". Don't stop reading, lol. Hear me out! But yeah, it would be awesome, right? Everyone would be uploaded onto the same computer so it would basically be like you never died. And because it's virtual, they could add tons of cool shit like flying and teleportation (basically anything you could ever imagine). It would feel exactly like real life except with unlimited amounts of perks and awesome features. If for whatever reason you would rather cease to exist, I'm sure they would have a feature that would allow you to do that. Anyways, this is something I've always thought about because I've always been depressed by the fact that once we die, that's it. Hopefully some crazy smart scientist/programmer reads this and gets started ASAP.Summary:
Summarize: I'm a guy of slightly larger than the "average" genital size (~6.5-7" length, 4.5" - 5" circumference)going by wiki , but just a bit over. The smallest porn star would easily put me to shame. Even so, if I wear standard-sized condoms my bits get so constricted width-wise that I can only wear them for a short time without being in real pain. They almost act like a cock-ring(keeping all the blood inside and keeping me erect even after intercourse) but a cock-ring that is too small. I've tried trojan/durex/lifestyles and just about any other brand of regular sized condoms I can find in stores. The only couple I've tried that actually seem to fit properly are Trojan Magnum, lifestyles "XL", or lifestyles SKYN "XL" I think they are called. Buying them has problems too because of the stereotypical person that buys a magnum condom (the usually young, immature type that wants to show everyone he has a big dick, sharing it on facebook and anywhere else he can post a picture). Even in the military I think it was they had to reissue condoms with sizes renamed because the soldiers would only take magnum-sized condoms when passed out for free which lead to the magnums running out and no one taking the regulars. There is also a great deal of hate both off and on the internet for anyone buying magnums b/c hate the above-mentioned stereotypical buyer and people feel the standard size fits all because condoms can stretch. Well, yes, they might stretch if you apply some real force to them, but they don't stretch like that simply by putting them on your penis. Does anyone else have this particular problem? Are there condoms out there that are just a bit wider without me needing to buy the less-than-modest Magnum packaging?Summary:
Summarize: It was the name of someone I was sorta dating, which is strange. My internet friend asked me what my name was and it was the first thing I could come up with - and it stuck. I also told her my "last" name, which happened to belong to this other person I had feelings for.Summary:
Summarize: Except the girl who's being fuck-zoned can put the dude in a situation in which he has to ultimately decide whether to date the girl or lose it all. The girl isn't seen as guilty of anything in this situation, just drawing a line in the sand (like you did). When it comes to a guy being friend-zoned the guy can't simply cut off the relationship because they aren't getting what they want, they look like dicks if they cut off the friendship, even if they are doing so to keep their emotional stability in tact (just as the girl was).Summary:
Summarize: I went out one night and invited a long-term buddy (let's say Hans). He showed up with a guy none of our usual group knew (let's say Kevin). Kevin kept hitting on my girlfriend and I tried to play it cool and redirect attention elsewhere. Fast forward 3 hours, I (and my SO) get tired of the relentless passes made by Kevin and end up in a scuffle. I knocked him out in front of ~6 cops (busy, bar-side of town). He comes to, I'm in hand cuffs, he decides to "let it slide" and we all go home after a miserable night out. This is where the story of friendship goes full retard. One hour after we got home, Hans shows up with Kevin to my house (complete opposite side of the tracks from his/their house) where Kevin proceeds to scream obscenities, threatening to kill me and waving a gun around. At that moment I realized my long-time buddy had terrible decision making skills. We say hi if we end up in the same place (mutual friends and shit).Summary:
Summarize: First, background info: My wife can't travel outside of the US yet. We have been married 5 months. She met me when I was at the peak of my "party" period. At the very beginning of our relationship, we started dating but didn't quite say that we were monogamous (it was assumed though). She had to go to San Francisco and was unsure if she would return. I went out one night (while she was in San Francisco) and a girl pulled me in for a kiss that I was lightly flirting with, it even surprised me. Two mutual friends were supposed to come there that night but cancelled last minute :( . Still my fault, should of cancelled the whole thing. Ever since we met, I have told her that I plan to travel the world, take some adventurous trips and try some crazy things. Fast forward to now, and I bring up the idea of me going to central america or somewhere similar for a backpacking trip with the guys. She responds negatively, and asks "why I don't want her to go" or if "I would be ok with her going somewhere with friends". I tell her I am completely fine with her going to Las Vegas, New York, etc to see her friends, I completely trust her. The reason I can't go with her is her heart condition (which acts up even when we go out to dance), which would be very dangerous if we are in the middle of a 3-4 day hike on a mountain. I also bring up the visa issue and the fact that time is running out before she want's kids and it's going to be hard for my to travel after that. My wife also brought up the fact that " I can't trust any guy friends! Guys don't care what they put their dick in, and they'll just keep it a secret", etc etc. Her father was a compulsive cheater and I think this is why she can't trust men in general, and also the incident from early in our relationship. Anyways, this leaves me in a tough place, she doesn't want me to travel with guys, she will kill me if I travel with any females haha, and she wont trust me to travel alone (which I also don't want to do - seems boring). This morning she even said "you don't even know how girls try and seduce guys", I wish that would happen atleast once when I was single.... I have explained it to her like this "sometimes I want to have a beer with you, and sometimes I want to have a beer with friends only to talk about random shit you don't like, same with trips/vacations". I honestly don't want to hide any details of my trips and want to be as open as possible. Since the incident I have not done anything for her to lose my trust, I have been everywhere with her, blown off the few girls that message me on occasion with typical messages, and haven't violated her trust. She even checked my skype messages and got mad at a "Ashley" i was messaging but never read the messages... it was a Chinese supplier that is actually a guy with the name "Nick wu" and I was getting quotes on items. Apparently having a girls name and thumbnail is good for business, which I explained to my wife. I haven't even been able to talk to lifelong friends in Ukraine (some female) because she tends to get jealous. Also, my friend DJ's for a local club and I promote for him through my network of friends - she also gets jealous when I come up to friends that all know I am married and with my wife at the club... My original plans were Thailand when I was single, as I have a lot of friends there with places to stay and people to show me around. As a result of marriage I have had to cancel that because of the infamy. Then again, if a guy wants to cheat, he will find a whorehouse anywhere (shiiit, I work on my cities whore street). Since then I have changed my travel plans to Central America as it is still interesting and not so infamous I guess.Summary:
Summarize: A raccoon. I'll be walking home in the early morning through dark alleyways, imagining the horrors hiding just out of site in the shadows and trashcans. Of course, nothing happens, but when I finally get home and flick on the lights, a pack of coons comes at me. One comes from the bathroom on the right, another from the room on the left, and each grabs an arm. I try to shake them off, but it's useless as several more come from each side and hold me back. Then their leader comes out from the darkness at the far end of the room, laughing maniacally and mocking me with his careless, masked eyes. By now I'm imagining the worst Clockwork Orange scenario possible, fearing I'm about to get coon-raped while being serenaded with Singing in the Rain. Suddenly, a group of raccoons grabs all my trash, and though I try to react as an instinctual response, the coons are still holding me firm. I feel a blow to my skull and hear glass break, then blackness. I wake up, who knows how much later, in a bathtub of ice with scars where my kidneys and appendix used to be. Exploring the house, I realize they have, indeed, stolen all my trash. The phone rings and it's the coons trying to sell my organs back to me at a huge markup, so I have to go to Walmart and buy store brand organs even though they're lower quality.Summary:
Summarize: I'll try to keep this short because I'm so beside myself. And, just, incoming. Pity party/woe is me/angst/nobody loves me/horrible person with horrible thoughts bullshit incoming... I've been dating my boyfriend (27/M) for close to two years. We've been living together since June of last year due to individual circumstances that lead up to that decision. No one needs to tell me that was a bad idea, as I'm reaping the repercussions. Not even a year after we started dating, because of being overworked and just plain lazy, my boyfriend ignored me for an entire six months and masturbated in secret. Leaving me to wonder why he wouldn't come to bed, why our sex life tanked, why nothing I was doing was turning him on or getting him interested in me. Sex, to me, is important, I love to bond, I love to make my partner feel good, and I would hope they would do the same for me. My boyfriend is very much more of a quality time person, gets his intimacy from day to day pleasantries, eating dinner together, etc. He was getting his needs met during this six month period and, I guess, just never thought to give a shit about me. This whole situation has turned me into a fucking monster. I am sad and angry all the time. I've been very depressed because I just feel fat, ugly, stupid for ever believing him when he said he loved me, and just "less than". Until very recently, I had a serious addiction to alcohol, that sent me to the hospital once, unbeknownst to him. We're in therapy, he recognizes why he did was wrong, and why, he knows he's screwed this relationship up almost irreparably, and I'm trying to work with him and trying to learn to forgive. But, last night, I almost lost it on him. I noticed when we came home from therapy yesterday that his mood tanked. I asked him what was wrong, and he said that he wasn't sure if I'd be sticking around to fix this with him, and ever marry him, because that's what he ultimately wanted out of our relationship. He later admitted he just wanted me to tell him everything would okay. That is what I should have said, 100%. Instead, I dodged his feelings and went on a diatribe about how I didn't have a timeline on forgiving him, that I was seriously, deeply hurt still, and didn't think six months was ample time to get over it, considering I've just only recently decided to get a handle on my health in an attempt to improve my self-esteem. He immediately got upset and yelled at me, "This is why I never fucking talk to you!" And turned his back to me (we were in bed). I kind of tried to keep my cool, but ultimately had an anxiety attack, and started defending myself. I basically retold the story of how he wasted six months of my life, cheated me out of a satisfying sex life because of his own selfishness and laziness. He told me I was turning the conversation away from him, making it all about me. I agreed, telling him it's rather hard to sympathize with someone who willingly ignores his girlfriend's needs because "I was tired, and pleasing another human being is too hard". Yes, he actually said that to me. He tells me two wrongs don't make a right, basically, that I can't suck him dry, and ask for all of this physical attention and yet make no attempt to meet his needs. He says our dynamic right now is unhealthy. I agreed, but, pointedly explained that I was justified, and not just doing it because "it's too hard/It's too much work". You know, I'm not a lazy asshole (or wasn't). I busted my ass and gave him way more than he ever deserves, and he took me for granted, and hell yeah, I'm fucking pissed. We ended the conversation without a resolution, and went to bed. But, holy fuck. I just want to strangle him. When he says things like this, it comes off as, "I apologized, started doing everything you asked,"(that he should have been doing in the first fucking place, but, I digress) "WHY WON'T YOU FORGIVE ME AND GET OVER IT???" I'm so out of my mind, confused, over all of this. I'm pissed that he's making such a big deal about me still being angry about being outright ignored because considering your SO's needs are "too hard", and I don't want him to have the security he previously had, because I feel he just wants something to abuse, again. When he told me that he felt I didn't love him anymore, I had to pause and redirect the focus of the conversation because, I honestly don't know anymore. I got burned, bad. I don't want to go through any of this ever again. He says he just feels like he's paying a debt, and nothing will get better, because it's been six months and I've still barely loosened up about it. I can't help but agree, part of me wants him to suffer what I suffered. Fuck him, right? But, logically, and on an empathetic note, it's 100% wrong to be like this with him. So I'm very lost, reddit. What do I do now? I want to work through this. How do I start to see him with at least a semblance of what I once did? How do I learn to respect him, again? How can I let go of all of this anger? I've gotten so bad since we started seeing our therapist, that she suggested I go on antidepressants because of how much more miserable I look every week. Every other aspect of my life is tied to this relationship. My job, my friends, things I value, and love, and want to be around to cherish. I used to have my boyfriend on that list, but now, every time we're in a room together... I don't know. I'm so tense, I feel like a burden, I feel like he'd be better off married to his hand, or someone he actually fucking loves, and treats them the way he should have been treating me. I'm so lost...Summary:

Summarize: One night I could not put my GBA down, so I nearly pulled an all nighter playing LeafGreen. I'm basically grinding in the Cinnabar Mansion before I challenge Blaine. It's around 3 am when I get into another battle with a wild Pokemon. It's a Muk, so it's rare to begin with and would get me a lot of experience if I defeat it. But wait, what is this? I thought I saw a weird animation, and that the Muk was not its normal color. Am I just seeing things because it's 3 am? Turns out I have actually encountered my first shiny Pokemon! I go to check on my Pokeball bag, and wouldn't you know, I have literally ONE POKEBALL to try to catch the shiny Muk. I managed to get its health low enough, and then I tossed the Pokeball, crunching away at the A button out of habit. The Pokeball shakes once, twice, three times, and then seals. Shiny Muk was mine! I feel like I should have had a Master Ball at that point, but I can't remember for sure...Summary:
Summarize: So I've been to two different therapists. Both were different from the other and neither helped. If anything they made it worse. My parents asked me if I needed a new one and if I needed them to talk to me and I should talk to them and blah blah blah. But that's the problem. I don't want to talk to anyone. Especially face to face. I would much rather talk to someone that I don't know and over the internet where I can be anonymous. It just makes me feel better. I feel like the therapist is judging me or something. It's not just the therapist though. I can't talk to literally anyone about my feelings if they know me personally (or face to face). So that means my family and even closest friends. It's just awkward. I honestly just wish I couldn't talk. That would make things easier for me..at least I think.Summary:
Summarize: Funny.. But I'm against the whole, 'throw the ball back' thing. I have season tickets to my team, one of the reasons being, I want a damn ball. I don't care who it comes from, I want one. It's a bucket list item of mine to catch a home run/foul/whatever. So I put myself in a position to have the most chances to catch one. You can boo me all you want, I'm keeping the ball even if it is a home run from the opposing team. Take for instance, last years world series. Pujols hits a record setting home run at the Ballpark in Arlington. The girl who ended up with it, under pressure, threw it back. Fuck that. That was a history making ball. Not to mention it was worth tens of thousands. You would have to kill me to take it away, I sure as hell ain't throwing it away.Summary:
Summarize: Safe answer: "I'm not against a god... I just believe that if there's a god out there, there's a pretty slim chance that it's the god of the hebrews." To be a bit more technical: "Okay, remember 2Tim 3:16, all Scripture is inspired by God, etc. etc?" "Yes?" "What if it's not true? I mean, what if someone, say... a Catholic priest in the 4th century added that verse to the Bible so that the Church could add all the bullshit they wanted?" If you want to be a bit more technical: 2King 22:8 and following: > 8 Hilkiah the high priest said to Shaphan the secretary, “I have found the Book of the Law in the temple of the Lord.” He gave it to Shaphan, who read it. 9 Then Shaphan the secretary went to the king and reported to him: “Your officials have paid out the money that was in the temple of the Lord and have entrusted it to the workers and supervisors at the temple.” 10 Then Shaphan the secretary informed the king, “Hilkiah the priest has given me a book.” And Shaphan read from it in the presence of the king. So what if Hilikiah didn't actually FIND the book of the law, but wrote it himself to gain political power? I mean, there's a bunch of hebrews each one with its own religion, and then the king says: Hey, I have an idea, let's make up some myths and pretend that all our suffering happened because we didn't obey some commandments that the people don't even know that existed?" Then you can go on the Deuteronomy and recall all the ridiculous laws that were put there, like no eating shellfish, no pork, not mixing crops, not wearing clothes of different textures, the mysoginy... and then ask: "Don't you at least feel that these laws aren't actually inspired by God? Them being made up by some jewish priest thousands of years ago actually makes a lot of sense to me."Summary:

Summarize: When it comes to talking to girls there are two pieces, state and articulation. State is all about your status. How you are projecting yourself, how the girl is responding to you. If you go up to a girl and think she is going to think you are creep then you are going to have that anxiety and project that on to her and that will in turn make her feel uncomfortable and want to leave. If you believe the conversation is going well, it will. If the conversation went well, ask for her number. The worst thing that can happen is that she would reject you and then you go on your way to talk to another girl. Articulation is like a puzzle of a famous painting. if you are able to do it fast and well. You won't have any problems flattering any girls. I was depressed for a long time, It wasn't something that ever got easier. But I taught myself how to articulate myself. Smoking weed also helps teaching yourself how to articulate better in conversations. The thing about language that is amazing is that there are many ways to say one thing. It takes true restraint to really take a step back and think about what you are saying when talking to people. I prefer to think of articulation as the art of provocation. When you think about some concept it helps to break it down into its parts and think about it, mess around with it. When we know in our brains what we need to say it makes composition and words choice and all that stuff so much easier. Articulation requires a larger than normal vocabulary, reading helps a lot. The words you use to craft the message is the conduit to that girls brain. The goal is to get her brain to go to the same place your brain, the same concepts, the same flow and feel of how the transition went in your brain. If your message was a drug, you want that drug to have a purity as high as possible. Now here is the part where it gets tricky, body language. Body language has more power than any words you could possibly use. If you tell a girl she is wearing a really pretty dress, but you are frowning, she can feel the loathing in your voice, you aren't making eye contact. It doesn't matter if you compliment her, if you don't have the proper state and stance to back up your words so that they are genuine it won't matter. she will think either you are weird (in a bad way), something is wrong with you or anything other than what she is supposed to feel. Maintain state, make sure she is getting a clear message.Summary:
Summarize: I actually had a gay porn scout try to recruit me once. Bad news, he's not going to get paid more than $500 to jerk off on camera. Guy on guy is $5000+ Girl on guy, the guy makes 0 dollars. My guess is they're really lowballing him for guy on guy, either that or he has a 12 inch cock, because that's the only way he'd make that kind of money for jacking off or as they call it "a sneeze shot". It's a very horrible business to get into. They fly you out of state, and once you get there, you're the porn companies slave until they send you home. You can't leave early, as they won't pay for the plane ticket. They try to make it sound like it's all fun and games... Kindof like a military recruiter. From what I hear, when you actually get there it's a nightmare. Ever seen those videos of pornstars having absolute breakdowns on camera? Well if you haven't, there's plenty of them out there. I have to stress the fact, that you're boyfriend is going to be tortured the whole time he's there. It's borderline rape. Kind of like "if you don't want to walk home from California to Florida put this dick your mouth". I will personally talk your boyfriend out of it if you want me to. It's a fucking nightmare in a half and I don't want those stupid ass gay porn people making money off of torturing someone. If he does decide to go through with it tell him DO NOT LISTEN TO ANYTHING THE RECRUITER SAYS.Summary:

Summarize: I once had a fuck buddy that clearly was in love with me, she was overly attached and was getting very fussy so I suddenly chose to ignore all her phone calls and SMS to get rid of her. She clearly was upset as I could understand from her last SMS, which told me what a douchebag I was etc. A few months passed by with no contact, and one time while being drunk I wanted to get laid. I messaged this girl and asked her to come over. She then asked me what the fuck I wanted and why I had been ignoring her. I then told her, out of pure horny, that my dad died when I broke contact with her and the reason to the ignore was because I was in a deep depression and could not talk to anyone. She came right over and I fucked the shit out of her. After that one time I went to ignore again, never spoke to her since. I feel bad.Summary:

Especially as melee you should not let him poke you and aim for all in fights (with champs that are stronger than him early, obviously.)Summary:
Summarize: To start off, I'm 18, F, lesbian (it becomes relevant). I've just graduated high school in a town I've lived in for 10 years, and I'm a little sad about the state of my life right now. Basically I feel as if my entire world here has cut me off for some reason. About a week ago, I was looking through some photos from the final high school band concert. There was a picture of all the seniors with our conductor, and I realized I'm not in it. No one even told me about it. I'd like to think it was just a mistake. I've had some debate with my conductor before, some of it kind of serious. We're generally civil to one another, but I'm pretty sure he's happy to be rid of me. This might be relevant, I don't even know. Despite living here for ten years, I was a really, really quiet and awkward child, so I only have two close friends that I made in high school (one F17, one M19). I'm terrified at the fact that we will probably never speak to each other again. We're usually a "tri-force of debauchery" (I love that we refer to ourselves as such), but we all seem to hate each other at the moment. Here's why: I know M19 friend and I simply tolerate the F17 friend. Honestly I don't like her behavior a lot, but we don't have major issues. Sometimes she just needs to excersize self control. As for the M19 friend, he's a little bit ignorant to the way real life works. He went to Christian school, and made no effort of rebellion (really, I'm not an asshat atheist. I just see that Christian school and public school are very different, and my friend is a human example). Its somewhat endearing, but at times frustrating. He once asked me 'how do gay people work'? This was funny, but in normal conversation, there are remarks about how I'm 'not really a girl anyway', and touching me a lot is 'okay, because it's not like you like it', etc. etc. Yeah, that sounds kind of creepy. More than I previously realized. To make matters worse, when we were closer/younger, people would joke about us being madly in love. (Background: M19 and I are talented. We were put in the highest ranking band as freshman, and when this happens, older members like to bust your chops.) I found it amusing, and he'd generally get angry or defensive about it. I don't understand this, either. I've asked him about it out of sheer curiosity, literally three years later, there are more questions than answers. Sort of. I don't think about it much. Despite flaws, I like these people a lot. I don't want to leave without spending some time with them. To accomplish such, I have phone numbers, but they've both blocked my facebook. I know that M19 has because his girlfriend doesn't like me (it still seems weird). The reasoning he gave me is that she is uncomfortable with us spending a lot of time together, likely because she's away at college. Though, she has no reason to suspect anything. He could never cheat. He can't lie to save his life. Besides, I'm gay, and she knows that. As for the F17 friend, I don't know why she blocked me, but I'm less distraught over that one. As a result of these things, I opted out of attending graduation and had my diploma mailed to me. Nobody asked or cared to know why I didn't show, except for my band conductor, because he needed to remind me that I owe money for a charter bus fee. I don't understand any of what's going on. Perhaps I'm socially inept, or I've offended everyone to some great degree. I'm not overwhelmingly rude. I say some "colorful?" things from time to time, and people call me witty for it. If everyone has such a problem with me, you'd think somebody would at least tell me I'm an offensive sack of shit. I'm moving to San Francisco in less than 3 months, and I'm going to be completely alone. It isn't something I fear necessarily, because Bay Area people are friendly and I'm from there anyway, but I'm leaving literally everything behind, and I don't really want to. The people, that is, at least my two friends that seem to give zero fucks. I might just be overreacting, as my facebook is riddled with graduation photos of classmates I don't even know. I know its just high school and in the grand scheme of things, unimportant, but I'm still incredibly depressed right now.Summary:
Summarize: And I wanted to talk about it! Background: I live in Canada, I'm 22M, and this is (jackass!) a throwaway. I'm not particuarly gay and I read that anal has been more and more common among heterosexuals lately so I don't feel weird or anything about it and I always wanted to try it. I've always had a very low level of prudishness(?) and am willing to try pretty much anything at least once and wanted to share my experience with everyone, particularly other males who are considering anal but don't know what to expect. Not that I am an expert or anything, this was only my first time too. There was no partner involved, just some toys I ordered online. It took until now for me to realize that I'm an adult with my own apartment and credit card, and I can finally buy some toys to try out. My haul included: A 9" Blue Jelly Rubber Dildo ( which I found out after the fact was not the best choice, see here for details but my gag reflex was too strong, so that idea was out since I wasn't going to try it again after I'd used it anywhere but my mouth no matter how much I cleaned it. Up to that point I'd already loosened myself up gradually with other toys so that when I finally inserted this one, there was next to no discomfort in the penetration. I was surprised to find I could take all 9 inches up to the hilt on my very first time (is that normal?), and having all of it inside me was very satisfying. The only downside to this toy, besides learning later about the rubber thing, was that it had a very poor suction cup on its base, making mounting it on the wall or anything dificult, and no form of adhesive like tape will stick to it for very long. In the end I constructed a sort of holster out of tape folded in on itsself that the rubbery balls portion docks with and remains locked tightly. I hope I can find a pthalate-free alternative/replacement. If anyone has any suggestions, please share! A Generic Wireless Remote Vibrator . It has one speed and seven options for the rhythm. Pink and waterproof! It's starting speed was a bit strong at first, but became very enjoyable after I grew acclimated to it. A second hard plastic vibrator , this one long and thin. It has a dial for speed at the base and goes faster then anything else I bought. Stimulating! A Small (possibly jelly, I should double check that) Vibrating Buttplug . It wasn't very satisfying since at its widest it was still smaller then pretty much all the other toys I got, but still nice for getting used to having things inside me. **[An Aneros Helix]( This didn't really work all that well for me because I don't have very strong muscles down there. I was not able to clench or unclench very hard, long, or often enough to achieve any significant sensation, but I won't rule this out until I've had more practice with it. An intimidating clinical-looking metal thing called the Pure Wand (formerly Jupiter Wand.) I haven't actually tried this one yet but I've read nothing but positive reviews about it. If anyone here has one, please share your experiences with it. Hard Plastic Anal Beads . They're a weird wavy shape but I am eager to try them out soon. That concludes the penetrative purchases, other things I bought were a rubbery red cock ring (It's kind of tight but I think that's the point. I didn't particularly enjoy the feeling of all the blood trapped down there or seeing parts of me turn red, coupled with reading about the risks , and a pair of nipple suckers (black PVC cylinders with a sphere the size of a Mirabelle plum you compress to create suction. Hair gets in the way so its good to be clean shaved anywhere you plan on using them, but otherwise they offer a very strong suction feeling and rarely fall free.) Last but not least, bottles of a silicone-based lubricant , a water-based lubricant , and a toy cleaning disinfectant type deal ([which I am now having second thoughts about after reading this comment]( I found the silicone-based was not as lubricating as the water-based, but lasted much longer. Water-based was very slippery but required more and more often applicated to yield desireable results. As always, take care to avoid using silicone based lubricant in conjunction with silicone based toys. Kind of a lot for first time buying, right? In the end it came out to be about 200$, since a lot of it was on sale. The metal Pure Wand dealie is usually around 100$ on its own so I'm pretty happy with what I got. The only product I didn't get in this initial spree I was interested in was an inflatable buttplug. If anyone has any experience with these, please feel free to share! Enough stories from me though, I do have questions too, beyond the ones asking about the specifics of various toys I mentioned before! Most of all my biggest concerns are about keeping myself and my new toys clean, avoiding any common problems, infections, or injuries I as a newcomer may face (are there even common injuries?) and most of all, I'd like to hear about others experiences with toys and their recommendations of products I might consider in the future.Summary:
Summarize: So, askreddit asked me what advice I had for the younger crowd and this was my contribution. I was too late to the party and nobody will see it, so I'm shamelessly copying it here. Not only does venting feel that much better when someone actually reads it, but I WISH I read a post like this two years ago. So here it goes; I'm not really old, but I'm sad to say that when it comes to buying a house I've grown old out of a bad experience. So, I'll give you; "How to buy a house" . Option 1 : You're buying a new house with all the warranty that comes with it. Well, it's going to cost you, but it's great. Good choice. Make sure the company is a serious one because if it goes belly up during your warranty period you might get fucked. There's not much else that can go wrong here. Spend the extra dollars of having a professional go through the house before the warranty expires just to be sure. No problem Option 2: You're buying a really old house, it looks like shit, and your getting it dirt cheep. Hey, you got a big job ahead, or money set aside to pay someone to fix it up. Either way, that's not a problem because you know this place is a shithole and that's what you're paying for. Option 3: You're buying a old house, but it's partly or completely renovated. Who cares if it's old right? It looks so great, and even though your paying a lot for that newly renovated standard it's still a tad cheaper than a new place right? Great deal right? NO, WRONG . Now is the time to be fucking careful my friend. Anyone can pick up dog shit, wrap it in foil and put a nice little ribbon on it. Looks like fine Belgian chocolate now does it not? Well, it's fucking dog shit. Anyone can paint old rotten wood, and it will look great for about six months. Then you can enjoy the sweet taste of dog shit as it seeps through the tin foil and between your stupid teeth. Anyone can put down some fine ass tiles on a old bathroom, but you won't know if it's really well done until a year later when the bedroom downstairs is either dry or wet as fuck with Winnie the poo and all kinds of shit living in a moldy forest between your floors. But Warcraft MD are you saying I should just stick with option 1 or 2? That really limits available houses. Yeah, it does. But a moldy fuck forest behind your bedroom walls will really limit your lungs, and your wallet if you ever wish to try and resell the godforsaken peace of shit house, that is. So if you HAVE to go with option 3, here's what you do: You can't see the important parts of the house, so be really up tight about the parts you can see. Is there a piece of missing paint at the bottom of the wall by the corner? Who cares right? You can pick up a paint brush and fix that shit up in no time. Probably just some old damage from a kid or a dog or something right? Does not matter, right? FUCKING WRONG . It means the people who live here do not care about details, if they could not pick up a paint brush before selling their newly renovated house they sure as hell did not do a proper job on all the other shit they did either. Is one fucking tile slightly miss-aligned? Don't buy that fucking house or that tile will forever stare you down while your sitting on your throne trying to force out a shit into your shitty house with shitty pipes knowing that you will forever be in a shitty place economically because of he shitty decision you made when you bought a shitty ass house with a shitty ass tile that tried to warn you about how shitty your life could become.Summary:
Summarize: I met a guy through work who I really hit it off with. Nothing happened for a while because I knew he was married but one day he stopped wearing his wedding ring and told everyone that his wife had moved out. After that we started seeing each other in a romantic context. Eventually after we started sleeping together it became obvious that his wife did not actually move out, as all of her belongings were still in the home, but he assured me that they were getting a divorce and that she was just staying there until she found somewhere else to go. We continued on like for about four months and everything was great. The age gap never bothered me and he became my best friend. He told me he loved me after about a month of dating. We used to go out with his friends and drink and they always seemed a little uncomfortable but it was still a good time. One day we were medging up at a bar and I got there early. I ran into one of his friends and she pulled me aside to ask me if I knew that he was still married. I told her yes but that they were divorcing so I had no issue with it. She then informed me that she knew for a fact that they were not divorcing and were living in domestic bliss. She showed me his Facebook (I guess he blocked me so I wouldn't know) and lo and behold, he is "soo in love with his wife jane!!" I confronted him and he admitted to everything. He assured me that he was in love with me and was going to leave her to be with me. I should have known this was bullshit, but I was blinded by what I thought was love so I believed him. This was 3 days ago. I didn't hear from him for two days straight after that. I tried calling him, emailing him, everything. Nothing. Then I found out he quit at work. Yesterday I got a text that said "I'm sorry for leading you on but I love my wife." I got so drunk last night and called him 26 times and cried. I feel like I'm being a crazy person and I know that he's a liar and I shouldnt care anymore, but everything I felt for him was so real and I'm absolutely heartbroken. How do I deal with this, /r/relationships? Why am I such a fucking idiot?Summary:
Summarize: It was kind of a bittersweet meet up honestly. Definitely not anything special or at all what we had discussed, but not exactly a disaster either. I'm not sure how to tell this story so I'm just going to start... My birthday is this month and he had been discussing what he wanted to do for/to me. How he wanted to just make the day all about my pleasure, sort of like the first time we slept together. He told me he got massage oil and and had been telling me he couldn't wait to get his hands on me, to tease me, and to taste me. That he wouldn't let me have his cock until I came for him. On his lips. That plan definitely went out the window. When I walked in he wrapped his arms around me and kissed me. My lips, my ears, my neck, and I was doing the same. Before I knew it he picked me up, my legs were wrapped around him, and he carried me to the desk. My dress was up around my hips and I could feel how hard he was through my thin tights. He pulled each of my legs up to his chest, running his hands the entire length, to remove my shoes as I laid back. I thought he was going to take me right there but we made it to the bed. We barely made it to the bed. He was pulling my tights off and on top of me in seconds. He left my panties on to tease me, letting me feel his hard cock against me. I reached down an pushed my panties aside and with one firm thrust I had all of him. That first moment always feels amazing. I feel so full, so tight around him. He fucked me like that, half of our clothes still on, moaning into my ear and neck, until he came. We relaxed still wrapped up in each other before finally stripping off the rest of our sweaty clothes and having a drink. We had somehow knocked the box of chocolates off the bed and wasted half of them. He laughed about how I ruined his plan and I told him there was still time. As we were talking and laughing and grazing what was left of the candy we we ended up discussing his wife and how jealous she is of one of their single neighbors and an invasion of his privacy that she did recently. I didn't know what to say and half hoped he wasn't making it up because of our communication talk recently (which we came to an agreement on anyway) and half hoped he was because it was a little crazy. Despite that awkward moment he soon had his hands on me again. I was the little spoon and he was caressing my body. Running his fingertips down my side, over my ass, gently kissing the back of my neck and nibbling my shoulder, until his fingers found their way between my thighs. He growled into my ear, mmm, as he does, "you're so wet for me" and I moved my ass against him so he could get inside me. I responded with a soft moan and told him I wanted him. He kept massaging my clit with his figers, his other hand across my chest holding me close, as he slowly but firmly pushed himself into me over and over, sending little waves of pleasure throughout my body. I could hear his breath quicken, even over my own noises, feel it against my neck. I was pushing back against him, my legs trembling, mumbling incoherent "yes"s between moans as he kept his pace. The perfect pace. As I started to cum he forced himself as deep as he could get and held his cock there, his fingers making just the right movements to take me over the edge, the arm over my chest held me tightly as I shook. After enjoying that for a few moments I rolled back against him, throwing a leg on each side, without losing his cock I was riding him backwards. This always makes me laugh a little because it reminds me of the "crab walk" game in elementary school. So, as I can't believe that is sexy, I sat up into reverse cowgirl. He loves looking at my ass and squeezing it and seeing me take him in. After what I believed was a good workout I hopped off and wrapped my mouth around him. I sucked all of my juices off of him. But I could only go so long wothout it and I started riding him again, leaning over to nibble his ears. The way he was grabbing me, the almost grunts I could hear, I knew he wanted it harder so I gave it to him, but before long he had me on my back again, with a pillow underneath me and my legs over his shoulders. He knows I love this, the slow deep thrusts and the way it makes his pelvis rub against my clit. It wasn't long befire my knees were buckling again and he started riding me hard, pushing my body towards the edge of the bed. By the time we finished my head and shoulders were hanging off. We didn't notice this but the clock in the room was an hour ahead so we didn't think we had much time afterward. We layed there relaxing and laughing and snuggling until he got into the shower. I watched him get dressed longingly and he came back to bed. It is always so hard for either of us to leave, and he started teasing me again. He was kissing my neck, which drives me crazy, and I alid his hand between my legs to show him exactly how crazy. Once he felt how badly I wanted him he started using thise fingers. Moaning and writhing he asked "can I make you cum like this?". I had to be honest. The answer was no. No one can, I barely can make it work myself. So he left me like that! All worked up wth no release. . . . . .Summary:
Summarize: I've been depressed my entire life, and I'm currently in a very shit spot where everything is joyless and I don't give a fuck about anything. I wrote a longer post about things here: Normally I stay awake half the night with anxiety and other thoughts/worries, but now I haven't slept at all for two days. This is the second day I've taken off work without calling in, and I'm trying to get myself back to the point of going in and facing the music. I don't care if I get canned or not, but I realize that doing so would be bad for me and the people I work with (primarily my dad). I've been coping by using alcohol for years, and I'm seriously concerned it's going to kill me. Since the beginning of the year I've been getting drunk almost every night and it's butchering my bank account. However, it's the only thing (other than drugs) that lets me feel other emotions and gives me a way to not give a fuck about everything I'm procrastinating on. It lets me feel numb about how I'm letting myself and everyone else down. I need other alternatives. I've seen a counselor but talking hasn't really helped, and the last antidepressant I was on was Effexor which did nothing, even though the side/withdrawal effects were totally fucked. I can identify self-defeating or self-destructive behaviour, but I having serious problems stopping or preventing it. I don't want to die. What else can I do?Summary:
Summarize: Okay, that's fine. Let's look at "the system" first then. JSTOR is a digital library of academic journals and research, as a researcher at Harvard, Aaron had the rights to access JSTOR. As a guest at MIT he also was on a network which had the rights (MIT allows access to it's openCampus members). That's pretty simple, he had the rights to access the database and was accessing it though an approved network. Let's look in to details though because that's where the devil is Here is what Aaron did. He hooked up his laptop (with legal credentials) to a MIT controlled-access router closet and downloaded around 70gb of that data. Aaron was a believer of information freedom and due to the fact that academic journals are (at best) in a confused copyright position he was probably willing to roll the dice on releasing this information, as he had done before with the library of congress. He was trying to exploit existing holes in the system to expose it's flaws. He was doing this as part of that system. It is very important to note that he had not released any data at the time of his arrest The response, well that's a long timeline He was arrested by MIT police and the Secret Service in January of 2011 and charged with 2 counts of breaking and entering with the intent to commit a felony. Now to be fair to the police here, the closet was a controlled access area and Aaron should not have been in there. According to reports, the closet was left unlocked. Aaron and JSTOR agreed that he gave them the data and they would not pursue it further and MIT agreed they would not continue to press charges if this happened. That should have been the end of it, He had legal access to the data and he had legal access to MIT (except for the closet), he did not disseminate the data and it was his laptop that was used. In July 2011 Aaron was then indicted by a grand jury wire fraud, computer fraud, unlawfully obtaining information from a protected computer and recklessly damaging a protected computer. In September 2011 Aaron was indicted by a Middlesex County Superior Court grand jury on state charges of breaking and entering with intent, grand larceny and unauthorized access to a computer network. In December 2011 the original charges of breaking and entering with the intent to commit a felony were dropped. In March 2012 (over a year now since his arrest) the state charges were dropped, a spokesperson said that this was done to allow the federal prosecution to proceed. In September 2012, federal prosecutors added nine more felony counts, which increased which meant that he was facing 50 years of imprisonment and $1 million in fines. At this point it's worth remembering that the "victims" of Aarons crimes were MIT and JSTOR and they were not willing to press charges. Now we are off to the races though, because prosecution did what prosecution does, they tried to indict him on some shaky grounds but relied on the fact that the defendant was not willing to fight this sort of prosecution at a federal level. I would now like to quote the wiki article >During plea negotiations with Swartz's attorneys, the prosecutors offered to recommend a sentence of six months in a low-security prison, if Swartz would plead guilty to 13 federal crimes. Swartz and his lead attorney rejected that deal, opting instead for a trial in which prosecutors would have been forced to justify their pursuit of Swartz Ahhhh shit, the fight is on now. It is unlikely that the prosecution were going to succeed (I'm not an expert but most experts in the law think this would be the case. Here is what John Dean By January 2013 Aaron had still not gone to trial but he had been dealing with the repercussions of his arrest for over 2 years. Aaron took his own life 2 years and 5 days after his arrest, the fight had just been litigated out of him America might not be a 3rd world dictatorship, however it's amazing the right to a speedy and fair trial were not afforded to Aaron.Summary:

Summarize: So, I had some friends in town on vacation for spring break. Of course we were dabbing constantly, and we were all high as shit (I have a nice shed in my back yard for chilling purposes only). I was heating the nail to do a dab and went to hit it. About two seconds after hitting it, I hear a knock on the door. "63Beetle! It's time to go to the orthodontist!" Obviously I couldn't just sit inside and not open the door. So, I grabbed my ecig and took a huge pull from it and as I am opening the door I blow it out. My dad sees it's 'only' ecig vapor and asks if I'm ready to go to my appointment.

Summarize: I don't have grad school experience, but I'm in a 4-year LDR and we're both in the post-college "real world," with mortgages and jobs and lives that make for similarly sticky issues. Props on being open-minded enough about things to try the open relationship. I dunno if we read too much Heinlein or something, but my relationship with my SO started out in kind of the reverse situation, while she was still married. We worked together, only knew each other online, but met in-person and had some unexpected chemistry. She and her then-husband talked it out, and we got the green light. (They eventually did divorce but I don't feel any credit/blame for that - they had issues of their own to work out.) I know that seems like an aside, but it does lead to our current situation. Given the way we started it was kind of implied that if we found someone nearby to fill in for a little while, we just needed to talk honestly about it. We explicitly confirmed that the last time we saw each other, but we also said we both didn't feel any particular need, or at least there wasn't anyone specific either of us had in mind. I'm trying to articulate what my personal concerns would be during that honest talk, and I'm afraid I'm having some trouble there. I guess I'd wonder what her current relationship with the person is - coworker? friend? stranger? - and I'd try to talk out with her just what she's looking for from their relationship going forward. I'm not worried she'd stop loving me, but upon reflection I can't say that I'm not worried that the distance wouldn't become too much trouble with a close alternative like that. And all I can do is fall back on the big rule: communicate. If he makes her happy, and the distance does become too much, well... I'd probably take a few days off work and curl up in the bottom of a bottle for a while, but as long as she's happy I'd find a way to be okay eventually, y'know? ...Oh, goddamn onions. Only you guys can say what makes you "happier than you are now." A one-night stand, a FWB, even a "local relationship" doesn't have to separate you two unless you decide to let it. Decide what you're both comfortable with. If you two end up with local partner(s) besides each other, /r/polyamory may be able to help you better.

Summarize: Hi all, I am not some grandmaster MOBA player but I have been playing the genre for four years or so now. Here are some basic tips about playing a MOBA, these can easily be the difference between being bronze and getting up to Gold+ ranking. Don't chase a kill under tower. If they get away, fine. Just pressuring an opponent out of lane is a big advantage because you will get more xp and cp then they will. Let the minion waves push closer to your tower. Forcing the opponent to have to stand far away from their tower will allow roamers/junglers to gank your lane. And this will give you safe csing. Early game especially, unless you are doing a 5 man push, don't be too aggressive with the minion wave. Don't use abilities to last hit unless necessary. Conserve your ability power until it is needed. Late game you can clear a wave if necessary with an ult or other ability, but early game you want to last in lane longer than your opponent. Last hit minions! Paragon is a bit tricky with last hitting but this should be your goal. Don't spam auto-attack and abilities, instead be patient, strategies who you hit and always be ready to get a last hit in. Hitting minions > hitting lane opponent. Get a pod shot in here and there if possible on opponent but never at the sacrifice of missing cp. If the opponent is dumb and allows you to keep hitting them that can be advantageous because they will have to retreat, but remember those last hits! Hide behind your own minions. This will prevent the opponent from hitting you with skill shots. Move back and forth, keep cover if possible. Do not push a lane past mid point without backup. Seriously just don't. Even if you think you can get in a few hits on the tower it is not worth dying for, you will die, someone is always in the jungle coming your way. If you push the wave past midpoint, look at the map where you can help, or port back and build up an item. Don't wait too long to port back, infact if you have 3 points and the wave is pushed/even then port back, that extra power will help a lot in fights. Don't forget harvesters. Also you can kill jungle monsters especially the easy 2 camps. Watch the mini-map, 60% of your attention at any time should be watching the mini-map. It will tell you where the opponent is, where the minions waves are...if someone is sneaking an inhibitor because the rest of your team is chasing kills. If the opponent gets the ORB do not try to 1v5, group up with team, your not a hero, don't pretend to be a hero, you'll just die and be cussed at. I am sure there are more tips, to sum it upSummary:
Summarize: So luckily for you all, this fuck up happened on this day and doesn't involve sexy times with anyone. Just me being a general dumbass. So me and some friends decided to get some food before our next class we all had together at 1:15 so at about 12:45-ish we all piled into each other's cars and went to the nearest Taco Bell. I fucking love those cinnabon bites you can get there now... I think they're going to kill me one day but that's besides the point. I planned on sharing these nuggets of delicious, sugary goodness with my friends and they're only available in 2, 4, or 12, so basically a sample, a snack, or diabetes as your choices, but that's besides the point. Anyways, I'm getting a dozen to let my friends have some. We're inside Taco Bell, not the drive thru, because the car line looked rather long and it's fucking cold out so we all go inside. I go up first, my order is easy, just a 12 pack of cinnabon bites. This is where I fuck up. I look right at the lady and ask for a 12 pack (Taco Bell enthusiasts may know where this is going already) without missing a beat. I'm ready to get my little personal serving of 'Merica in a plastic cup and don't really think anything when the cashier asks me 'crunchy or soft?' Now I've ordered these bites in 12's before and really should've realized that was a weird question to ask for fried dough, but no, I'm a fucking retard and say, "wow didn't know you could do that... um, how bout soft?" so she rings me up, hands me the receipt and my card (important) and it says 12 fucking dollars on there. Um, they cost 4.50? So it's at this point I realize... oh shit, I just ordered one dozen soft tacos instead. Now this isn't a big deal, just take the tacos? But nah, I want my cinnabon bites and I'm determined to have my friends experience the foodgasm these will create upon touching our tongue. So as politely as I can (I work as a concessionist as my job so I try to be polite and not a hassle like some customers can be) I explain I've really screwed up on my order and it's my fault entirely. Could you give me a refund for this, I meant the cinnabon bites but didn't make that clear enough (because I'm a goddamn moron mind you). You'd think that'd be it but nope, it can't be that simple. This IS a fuck up after all, not just a minor mishap. So the cashier looks a bit befuddled and worried at once. She tells her manager, a shorter, stockier, younger woman complete with obviously fake colored hair and a massive attitude, she needs a refund. The manager looks like she's going to jump across the counter and fucking kill me. Now without looking directly at me, because that'd of course be way too rude and direct, she starts talking VERY loudly about how inconsiderate this is and how there's people waiting (I felt bad enough for keeping my friends and the assorted strangers waiting) but really was taken aback she was making this huge a deal out of this. A refund right? Well I paid with a card. And this manager doesn't know how to refund a card payment. And as far as I could tell only one of their registers was open so I'm holding up the whole line. (opening up another one isn't that easy, again concession experience) I feel so stupid now, but at the same time, I really couldn't help but wonder how you can earn the title of manager but not perform a card refund? My place of work, all managers and even some regular cashiers can perform refunds for customers. This manager had to call someone higher up, maybe customer service, shit I don't know, to tutorial her on how to do this refund. Meanwhile she's yelling to the back, do NOT make that dozen tacos, ay throw in a dozen cinnabons, while I'm standing off to the side letting other people get their orders out of the way. I feel like a really dumb shit, my friends think this whole ordeal is priceless, and I mean I'm not socially anxious, this is pretty funny, but I still felt bad for holding up the line. I overheard an older guy wondering why this woman couldn't just do the refund and made a public point of me being a detriment to the establishment or something but after quite a few more minutes, she rings up the refund, gets me some cinnabon bites and a reciept, all while looking super duper flustered. I don't think I've ever seen a human being so pissed off over dumbassery, it was just a mistake, allbeit a really stupid one. I felt a bit selfish for not just taking the tacos really but I work minimum wage and really didn't want to spend 12$ on food I didn't want and figured a refund would be a reasonable request. At the end of the ordeal, we were two minutes late for class (after intense reckless teenage driving) but I had the bites, the cinnamon sugar sprinkled food of the gods, and I was content.Summary:
Summarize: Hi Reddit, First post here so I hope I do everything right. I should make a quick note that he only does the physical abuse when he's angry. In the beginning, our relationship was great, nothing was wrong and we go along like any happy couple. I'd say the verbal abuse started around 6 months ago, this is when he'd shout right at me and shout every bad name under the sun at me when something has upset him...he's admitted that nearly every time wasn't my fault he was angry but I was the only person there to take it out on? Next came the physically abuse, this started about 2-3 months ago. First it was little things like pinning me down or shoving me out of the way but it has quickly progressed to physically grabbing me hard, screaming in my face, head butting me hard several times, kicking me in the stomach and grabbing and even pulling out my hair. This abuse leaves me with many bruises and black eyes. The next day, I don't know how he's going to act. He could be really apologetic and ashamed of what he's done or he could be really cold, distant, refusing to apologise and even blaming me for what he's done. Now the emotional abuse, everything always is my fault no matter what. If I'm feeling down or sad for some reason, he'll make me feel guilty for being sad, twist it round on him so he can feel sad so I have to forget about my feelings and care about him. He'll also play mind games with me such as getting a laugh out of making me cry, laugh at me and then patronisingly tap me on the back saying it will be okay. In the past he's said things including "You're a pile of shit" " I don't owe you anything" "I hope you get run over" and even going as far as saying " if you don't move out the way, I'll grab you and put you in the traffic". He always tells me my feelings and opinions are wrong and he's right. It's really breaking me down slowly, yes I love this guy and yes I want to help him but there's only so much a person can take. It seems like he can do whatever he wants to me and I am expected to forgive him but I do the slightest thing wrong (which can include spilling a drop of water on the floor) he'll continue to "punish" me until I'm literally begging him to stop. This punishment includes neglecting any form of physical contact, doesn't care or notice how I feel, and doesn't show any empathy regardless how much I'll apologise and beg. I hate being ignored so obviously he does this to upset me even more. When I'm upset, usually about something he's done to me he tells me to deal with my problems myself, he doesn't want to be there or help me and that I should grow up without even a hug or kiss. When he's upset me, I'll do whatever I can to get it back to normal which includes apologising, making him food and cakes and just overall being nice even though he doesn't deserve it and it's because I'm scared of him. When he's angry at me and taking it out on me, I'll let him and try to calm him down because I hate seeing him upset. The one occasion that really upset me is that my grandad recently passed away and it was a really hard day for me, I admit I was emotional and slightly grouchy but he can't deal with that. He twisted it round, made the whole day about him and acted like my feelings didn't even matter. Yep, on the day of my grand dads funeral, he got violent with me and made me feel even worse about myself. One day he can be the nicest person ever, being really nice to me, buying me presents, hugging me, wanting to get close and overall being an amazing boyfriend that I know he is deep down. But other days he can be completely different by getting violent, getting moody, being distant, cold and uncaring and it's frustrating trying to adapt my mood and my feelings to his personality that day. This relationship really is destroying everything I've got. It's destroyed my confidence, self worth and overall made me feel nothing more than a walking skeleton. I feel so broken, now when he gets angry I just apologise straight away because no matter what I say it will always be my fault. I should mention that we do live together and he's got quite a stressful job. Please help me reddit, what can I do to help him?Summary:

Summarize: Well, I sort of did. For the past couple of months, my mother mentioned that the one thing she really wanted for Christmas was a hoodie, as she had given the one she had before to a homeless man. After buying all her other presents, I had realized I hadn't gotten the hoodie. I went to Target about a week ago and bought a fairly nice one. But then my mom mentioned today that not only did she want a hoodie, but one with a design of some sort on it, not just a plain color. She mentioned that she had said this all along whenever she mentioned the hoodie thing. If I remember correctly, the one I got was just a plain gray hoodie with nothing else on it. This has been eating at me for a while now.Summary:
Summarize: The problem with FATES and most open world content in FFXIV is that this game depends on boss mechanics to get most of its "interesting" mechanics. Any boss outside of of a dungeon, where the devs can put big AoE's and objects to interact with, and arena to fall off, is just going to be a tank n' spank. Seeing as this game isn't really an action MMO, tank and spank is quite boring. Also, a lot of people can do a FATE at one time, so if SE did decide to give unique mechanics (other than bursting down Odin before he uses his final skill) then it'd be REALLY hard and frustrating to coordinate all of these people.Summary:
Summarize: Pre-note: There's no humor in this. Sorry. If you're looking for a joke answer, skip this response. After college, I spent a year working for a charity that helps fix up the houses of people at or below the poverty line. This was in a large city, so there were a lot of dilapidated urban areas in need of help. Now, this city was fairly far north, so we would work on the outside of houses in the summer (doing things like repainting, adding mobility ramps, fixing rotten stairs/decks, stuff like this), and in the winter we'd move inside, working on everything from replacing broken doors to painting to redoing drywall to fixing water damage to installing new laminate or vinyl floors to removing moldy carpet. Each project took about a week, and it would usually be myself, 1-2 coworkers, and maybe a volunteer or two. More importantly, the homeowner was supposed to help if they were able/able-bodied (e.g. didn't have work, weren't a senior citizen, weren't disabled, etc.). Fun times. Now, on to the family. It was mid-February and we got a call to go out to a house and fix their doors. This house was over 50 years old and had settled, and all of the doors no longer fit in the skewed doorways. And these also had to be solid-core doors, according to our action plan. Now, immediately, that raises some questions. Most interior doors are hollow-core - they have a cardboard lattice inside that gives the door its shape and makes it nice and light and easy to swing open or shut (and to haul around). But all of these had to be solid-core (filled with chip-board, same stuff that Ikea makes everything out of). Why in the world? Well, when we arrived at the house, we found out. This house had at least 8 people living in it. From little bits and pieces that I picked up while my supervisor talked to the family, several of the family members were felons, and they would invite their friends over. One of the reasons we were replacing these doors was so that they could be properly shut and bolted so the family members wouldn't be robbed or assaulted in their sleep. Let me repeat that. This family needed solid bedroom doors with locks, so that family members wouldn't rob them and friends invited in wouldn't assault them. Well, okay, we'll make the best of this bad situation. Solid core doors (that had to be cut/planed along the bottoms to fit in the skewed doorframes), drill holes for deadbolts, check frame integrity, install braces/strike plates, etc. Nothing too out of our comfort zone. I would have felt bad for this family, knowing their situation, except for one thing. Everything in this house was shit - except for one item. That item was a massive TV. 72 inches at least. Displayed in the center of the living room, every couch in the house arranged around it. And all day, this is where the entire family sat. Maury. Endless inane talk shows. Those crappy reality game shows. TLC. And in front of this TV, 4 able-bodied adults, 3 senior citizens, and at least 2 kids sat, their eyes glued to the TV for the entire week. Occasionally someone would bring in (shitty) food and they'd all eat there. Meanwhile, I would get yelled at every time I moved a door in front of them, blocking their field of view (we would cut/sand the doors outside, to decrease sawdust in the house, and then bring them in to check the fit). Remember, this family was getting this work for free - and they had agreed in the contract to provide help. No help was given. None of them seemed to care that we were there, except for complaints about the cold seeping in when we opened the door. No thanks. All they did was sit in their broken-down house all week and let their brains rot. In the course of my year at that job, I saw plenty of people in terrible situations - senior citizens slowly losing mobility and self-sufficiency while trying to keep their homes together, disabled veterans with no one to care for them, children growing up in absolutely appalling and dangerous conditions. But I could identify with most of them, could see their drive to improve their life, could tell how they wanted to escape the black hole of poverty. But not this family. They were rotted out from the inside, no longer even caring. They had sold their future for this TV, had sacrificed their safety and security and health, and they cared for nothing else. The tales of other families broke my heart. This one merely made me seethe with rage.Summary:
Summarize: If you're not allergic to grasses, it shouldn't be too bad. There are so many more grasses here (it is a prairie, you know) that my allergies are much worse than in the northeast, even with fewer trees and virtually no mold. I also agree with the person who mentioned the forest fires... that'll do a number on your respiratory system. You may also have trouble with the smog, aka "[the brown cloud]( even though it's much better than it used to be.Summary:
Summarize: Okay this article is full of misleading, agenda-packed, political crap. Here's why. The article describes how automated exchanges like NASDAQ encourage liquidity, and they do this by interpolating volume a little, and in this particular case, the market demand for some symbol. If the demand is interpolated as "increasing", it starts ramping up the buying of said symbol from the ask queue in order to have inventory to sell to expected high bid volume. As hard as this is to believe, this is actually necessary and smart, and if done efficiently, isn't even that big of a deal, which is why it amounts to 0.56% difference for a $1.4M volume.Summary:
Summarize: There was a patch that changed karthus Q that when you are in his passive, if you his Q slightly off it's range it will still pop at the end of range in same direction instead of not popping at all as it used to be. I think this change should apply to every skillshot in game when a champion that cast it got snared. For example you gank enemy lux as chogath, you got snared, but she is still in your Q range, unfortunately you casted your Q slightly off your range and it didn't cast at all -> lux escaped. After change I propose your Q would still land and possibly catch lux. This change would make game a little bit easier, but since karthus got it in his passive it means it could be used for all champs.Summary:
Summarize: Your story is very similar to mine. I've had a forced feminization fetish for as long as I can remember, and it ramped up due to continual porn and masturbation over the years. For the longest time I was fine with it: being a shy kid with no romantic prospects, it was how I got off, so although it was odd, I just went with it. Once I started breaking out of my shell and pursuing relationships, I realized that this fetish had basically warped my brain and made normal relationships with girls really difficult. While I've gotten better with girls, I've developed ED and general sexual frustration, which has been very painful to face. I strongly believe that my reliance on my fetish, in addition to inexperience, has made it so that I can't function normally in "vanilla" sex, which is something I desperately want. I saw a sex therapist who definitely helped me deal with unfounded shame and guilt I felt about the fetish. But throughout this time, I've still felt that as much as I "enjoy" the fetish in terms of getting me off, I really have no desire to enact these fantasies in real life. I want to get off based off love, not humiliation. And I want healthy sex with girls, not with my hand in front of a computer. I've been trying NoFap for about a year, with my top streak at 52 days, and I'm determined to get 90 days and beyond. Among the goals I have is to weaken or maybe even eliminate my fetish. I don't know if a successful 90+ day reboot will do the trick, but at the very least I'm trying, and perhaps I can gain sensitivity to normal, fulfilling sex with girls without the fetish. I'm not sure what advice I can give you about informing your girlfriend, as I've grappled with the same kind of thing. I haven't told people in my day-to-day life about my fetish, although if a lasting relationship comes along, I'm sure I'll need to address it. In the meantime, best I can advise is keep at NoFap, try a successful reboot, and see how you feel about your fetishes afterwards once you've cleared out some of the cobwebs in your brain. This MUST include refraining from looking at porn, even if you aren't masturbating to it! That's certainly what I'm trying (and you're two weeks ahead of me!)Summary:
Summarize: I'm in Wellington (where the qualifying game was) right now, and I have to say that it's not "batshit insane" at all. There's waaaay more interest in the fucking santa parade at 2pm than some soccer team....and there's a wine festival on, so most people are at that. The one soccer thing I saw on my way to work, was a bar with a chalkboard outfront which read "congrats to all whites", but that might just be some white supremacist shit....Summary:

Summarize: So hey, looong time lurker i decided to make an account specifically to ask your guys help with this bc its becoming unbearable my boyfriends sons mother is absolutely insane, she is stalking me and sending me threats and keeps trying to break us up and just generally making my life more difficult. She is txting me from random numbers saying she knows where i live and where my daughter goes to daycare, so i better back off her men or else. i've blocked her from every social media possible even made a call to twitter to make sure she couldn't see my account and yet she still finds a way to see everything i post and will call/txt me screaming if i even mention my bf or his son in them. She keeps trying to break my bf and i up saying i'll never has his baby blah blah blah. it's just non stop harassment, and no i cant get a restraining order bc then i can't pick up and drop off his son and the welfare of our kids is more important to me then anything else. we have a court date with her to settle custody stuff bc she has a habit of keeping his son from us until we do what she wants. So its with some shame i ask for advice to get back at her, just a little revenge, i know its not classy of me but it would sure make me feel a whole hell of a lot better.... I was thinking maybe slashing her tires or keying her car, but the thing is the cars in my boyfriends name and she's broke so if it gets towed thats on him, same with her house anything that happens to it falls on my bf bc that is also in his name. plus i want something more devious and clever, as long as it doesn't involve the kids i'll probably give it a try.Summary:
Summarize: When I was a little kid in elementary school, my mom was friends with our principal.. or maybe his wife.. anyway one day they invited her, my brother and I over to swim in their pool. After we were done swimming, me and my brother went in the house while my mom was outside visiting. We wandered around exploring and found a room upstairs that had a big window that we could see my mom out of. So we were snooping around and found a huge pile of pennies, and for some reason felt the need to take them. We had to have them. We were going to find a way. Suddenly I came up with a bright idea! You know how the lining in the crotch of bathing suit bottoms is sometimes only sewn on one end and open on the other, kind of a creating a little pouch? Yeah.. "Hey brother, look! I have the perfect little pocket to put them in!" I say, as I start shoving in as many as I can fit. This was quite a few since the bathing suit material is stretchy. So I then proceed to walk around with a bulging crotch of pennies thinking that no one will notice. I'm pretty sure they noticed. Edit:Summary:
Summarize: My mother is trying to create her site on Wordpress and is having a shit-ton of issues getting started. She's not computer illiterate, but she can't grasp some of the fundamentals (like unzipping files, locating stuff on her computer, many of the terms [FTP for a start]) so all the online tutorials she's tried to follow have gone over her head. She tried hiring a techie to get her going, but that person took her money and ran, so now she's reluctant to give hired help another chance. I'm not much help because my site-building expertise doesn't extend far beyond basic HTML and a smattering of CSS. What resource(s) can I point her to? I'm getting tired of trudging over to her PC every ten minutes only to disappoint her when I can't magically fix her problems. If there are any details I can provide to help narrow down where I can start, I'll be happy to do so. I just want her to be able to get her site up and running. This has been going on for over six months.Summary:
Summarize: I find it demeaning and patronising, as a man, that society thinks that I need to be reminded what rape is, and not to do it. Well, I find it demeaning and patronising, as a woman, that society thinks that I need to be reminded what rape is, and not to be raped. This is satire and that's exactly what you missed, maybe because you've never been handed a "how not to be raped" list at a college orientation or in an email forward, or in a women's bathroom stall that it is an almost exact copy of? You've never had the experience of being told how to behave to avoid someone sticking their penis in you without your permission so when the exact same "advice" is flipped to put the responsibility back in the hands of the rapist you get all offended. Too bad. Yes, we need to educate people how to protect themselves, but often the message that this "advice" sends is that you can prevent being raped, so if you are raped it's your fault for failing to be vigilant enough. This image is saying "No, it's always the rapist's fault, let's focus our efforts on blaming rapists and not victims."Summary:
Summarize: So, more happened today... The not understanding owner came in and yelled at me about a blog post. In case I did not say so before: all employees are now required to contribute to the blog. The post he was yelling at me for is in regards to The Last of Us. Someone made a fan film, and my post referenced while referencing and plugging upcoming product releases for the game. It was labeled Not Suitable For Work in the blog entry. I had sent the entry a day earlier to someone at our secondary location to examine and post if it was found to be suitable. The Walking Dead Season 4 trailer had been posted a week before, and there was no tag for that. Lol He accused me of making jokes about the incident and how he handled it and of making light of a settled situation, despite the fact that it is not settled. He then went into the back room. He came out later and asked me about the printed copies if the e-mail the manager had sent. Now, these e-mails had been inside my personal lunch bag. I believe that by going into my lunch bag, he violated my personal privacy. He brought my status as a Christian into play and accused me of being nitpicky about the manager's behavior, as he is human and allowed to be cold and unprofessional to me after what he did. He asked me if I was considering litigation, and I DID lie about that. I did not like doing it, but I did not want to throw my lawyer under the bus. He left after stating that both the manager and myself would be receiving warnings, and he said there would be a meeting tomorrow at noon between him, the other owner, the manager, and myself. I cannot attend this meeting. It is at the start of my shift, and I view this as an intimidation tactic. I have called and left a message with my lawyer and am praying for the best.Summary:
Summarize: I am in Silver 1 and really trying to get to Gold but it is even harder whenever people simply quit due to some people talking to you in a "rude" way. It's the internet! I won't sugarcoat this and I will say that sometimes I'm that person that tells you, "Dude seriously, dont try 1v5 the team, have some map awareness ffs". Then, let's say in this scenario, the person gets butthurt and says something along the lines of "I'm not having fun anymore, just gonna feed, f*** this trash team", when we were only 5-12 (We could still comeback). In the end, if the person is harassing you, there is always an ignore button (Of course there is a fine line between telling you what to do in a "rude" way and actually bullying you). Another subject is when jungler takes blue from an 0-4 mid, obviously, the mid will just feed it to the enemy mid and keep matters worse but what does our mid do when this happens? "Omg, jungler didnt give me blue gg afk". Just bothers me that people wont take ranked as seriously as I do and simply give up or quit when things look rough.Summary:
Summarize: Hi LoL community. This will make me look like an attention manwhore but I've been going through tough times lately. Very tough times actually. At some point I even considered suicide :/. It seemt like everything was going wrong. Only when I was reading this subreddit or when I was playing LoL i could get my mind off of things. Laughing at tits or ass man and ponto1 aka horny darius, reading AMA's, made me feel like I was actually included, like I had friends when I was sure I lost them all. I can go on and on but I don't want to bore people that actually read all this. Thank you so much for being such a great group of people.Summary:

I don't hate either Lucario or Zoroark, they are awesome imo but Lucario gets waaayy too much promotion (they tried and failed with Zoroark though)Summary:

Summarize: The problem lies in a few things: 1) Shoot First has no cooldown. You can Shoot First out of stealth, then Vanish and do another one if you REALLY wanted to. 2) Undergeared opponents vs. well geared Scoundrels. 3) Biggest one right here, none of the opponents did anything to stop it. "But they were CCd!" Yes, every class has a CC break, a lot of classes have a ~10% hp self heal, and every class can access a 5k heal medpac that gives 15% bonus HP. If you want to live vs. people stacking buffs and adrenals, you need to pop some cooldowns of your own. Nearly every class has a way not to die from 100-0 by a Scoundrel. If you're undergeared, that's tough, but it's just how MMOs work. Scoundrels only 100-0 people because they pop every cooldown on someone who pops no cooldowns.Summary:
Summarize: Never posted before, using throwaway, posting from mobile. Until recently I was in a 4 year LDR with a wonderful girl I loved very much. Everything was fine until she got this new job about a year ago. It's a very demanding and consuming job, she had to move away from friends and family and live alone for it. Brutal hours, and impossible to take more than a couple days off at a time until, as she put it, she "works for several years to earn that much time off". She no longer had any time for me, and we had a fight. We didn't speak for two weeks, not even a text, and at that point I decided enough was enough. She had put zero effort in for a long while and that was the last straw. I ended things via text (our timezones/her work schedule made calling very difficult) and she read them but never replied. I figured she'd never talk to me again. Over the last year of my LDR I became close with a female coworker, but it was strictly friendship. I'll call her Jen. My ex was the jealous type and I knew it'd upset her so I never told her. I even never hung out with this girl outside of work until my relationship ended. I found out very quickly that Jen wasn't looking for a relationship, but did want to be friends with benefits. Aside from all of that she's also just a fantastic friend, and helped me to deal with my breakup in alot of ways. 6 weeks after breaking off with my ex, she texts me. She admitted she ignored our problems and neglected me, and realized her mistake after so many weeks of no contact. She said she missed me, her best friend, and said she didn't want to lose me as part of her life. She also said that maybe we could talk out our problems. I believe everything she said to be true. Later that same day, Jen invited me to come over to her place for sex later in the week (she's always been very upfront) and being single I of course said yes. I find Jen extremely attractive sexually, and am a virgin to boot, which she likes apparently (my LDR was sexually starved. Despite 4 years, we hadn't seen each other since she left for home and we never went all the way before that). Jen knows I had contact with my ex, but pointed out that I'm single and free to do as I please. Having talked to my ex over a few days it became clear that despite breaking up we still held strong feelings for each other. I told her about the dates I tried to go on and she said it was fine because we are not a couple... but eventually I got her to admit that, yes, it did bother her. She also thought that my talking about these girls, especially my new friendship with Jen (of which she is extremely jealous), meant I wasn't interested in being with her again. I told her I'd be willing to give it a shot, but only if she made some big changes or it could never work. She said she would seriously think about it. Now the fuckup. Last night I got drunk with the boys and stupidly decided to tell my ex I had sex since we broke up. It was a lie, but I wanted to know how she would react and if, despite what she said about not being a couple, it bothered her. I wanted to know what I was to her. And also, I did still have a fuck date with Jen lined up. Would she be okay with her now single ex fucking someone else? I wanted to know how she really felt. So I tell her this, and she says "she suspected the whole time" (despite it never happening..) and assumed it was Jen. She became upset and I, still drunk, decided that I should tell her the truth, that I'm still a virgin. Figured it'd make her feel better, whoops on my part. She got (rightfully) pissed that I was lying. I fucked that up, and she's thinking about what to do with me. I need advice. I can see myself having a future with my ex, I adore her and it could work if she's willing to make changes. But it is by no means certain that she will, even before I upset her when I was drunk. I'm asking for big changes she wasn't willing to make originally. Jen on the other hand isn't sure if she wants a relationship right now but does want to fuck around. If I decide to ignore the fuck request, it will likely offend Jen and possibly ruin an amazing friendship. But if I go through with it and my ex decides to give it another shot, then it would probably break her heart despite us not being a couple when it happened. Worst case is to not do it, and my ex decides not to try again, ruining both relationships. I'm going to see Jen tomorrow. I need advice.Summary:

Summarize: About 1.5 months ago I got in the biggest fight with my ltr of our relationship. I am 30 and she is 28. She ended up going home to her parents house for about 2 weeks to think things over. We finally hit a breaking point but she ended up coming back and we are working through it. This has led me on a road to better myself with or without her. I was a mess when she left but I'm now finally to see that life without her is possible. I'm not going to kid myself in thinking I don't have oneitis. I did a lot of introspection and reading and have finally started to realized how beta I've become with her over the years. I was addicted to porn for probably about half my life and weed for 10. I have since cut both of those things out. I also have since read NMMNG and I think I relate to that so much and used the porn and weed as an escape. In he beginning of our relationship was crazy sex marathons. But after a a few years it simmered down to about once a week. At first I thought it was just because I was bored of her. I was/am extremely attracted to her but I didn't need her as much sexually because I had let porn consume my sexuality. I see that now since I've quit the porn. In the initial period of 2-3 weeks of no porn barely fapped and maybe had sex once with her. Since then I have been initiating with pretty good results..maybe 4-5 times in a week. I have also read SGM earlier with decent results. She does reject me and I try to be OI but it ends up with me being too butt her and she can see straight through it. E.g. Last night, before bed, I initiated a BJ and she declined. I was trying to be direct with her but saw it as too demanding and didn't comply. I ended up just being cold to her not cuddling/hugging/kissing and attempted to go to sleep. She woke up in the middle of the night to me reading and I tried to initiate again with her hard no again...she then got upset, started to cry and said I was being a jerk and all I wanted her for was sex. I comforted her by hugging and kissing her and it actually resulted in her giving me a bj when I attempted to initiate again (I reciprocated afterwards when she asked). While I do enjoy the sex that is not the only reason I'm with her...I do the majority of the cooking/cleaning in the house. I see now that it is pretty beta but I'm simply better/more efficient than her at those things. She helps wherever she can/when I ask her. After reading NMMNG I can see how I am sometimes resenting her for this. We both have full time jobs. Do I continue doing these things as the captain of the ship for myself? Do I only do my portion of the laundry?? I don't feel like waiting for a time for us to both do it together sometimes and just want to get the job done. I'm learning day by day to maintain my frame better. Remaining calm and removing myself from situation when she starts getting emotional/crying. Previously I would engage her and try to defend myself getting emotional myself and end up resenting her. TRP and MPR has helped me a lot so far in a short time. I've always lifted and have maintained myself in decent shape.Summary:
Summarize: My girlfriend (27F) and I (24M) had been dating for 18 months. When we met, she had a boyfriend that she told me she was planning on breaking up with. I fell for her hard and fast and when she broke up with him we were dating a week later. She is what I would consider my second real relationship and the true love of my life. I won't claim that things were always perfect. We had our share of fights, but always made up. It always ended up with us reconciling and talking about our future together. When times were good, they were the best of my young life. She was my best friend. We had so much fun! I had never met a woman that I could go out drinking with, or just hang out, or make love and enjoy it all equally. I was and am very attracted to her. We both expressed desires to one day get married and have a family together. Which was a big deal for me. I never bought into the whole white picket fence and 2.5 kid nuclear family thing. She changed all that. We were both honest to each other about our past histories. She told me that she had cheated on her previous boyfriend by getting fingerbanged by a guy. I told her the one thing I couldn't stand was infidelity. I've never understood my generation’s cavalier attitude towards sex. I've been with other women before her, and had trouble separating sex from emotion. I told her if she ever cheated on me, we would be done. It came up enough that she knew how I felt. About 2 or 3 months ago we got into a big fight. Talked about what our issues were with each other and decided to really work on them. After that, the last few months were the strongest of our time together. The best things had ever been. Our sex life was great, and we didn't argue nearly as much in the past. She seemed so happy, and I knew I was. This last Friday we went to a social function with both of our parents and lots of friends. It's an annual thing in our community where everyone gets dressed up and listens to X-Mas music. Think prom with a lot more booze and middle aged people. The whole night she is weird and distant. Doesn't want to dance with me, sit with me etc. My friends and family noticed asking me if everything was okay. We went home separately. The next day she wants to meet with me on my lunch break. When I show up she is sobbing in her car, she tells me she cares about me, but doesn't love me anymore. At least she doesn't love me like I love her. She tells me she isn't breaking up with me, she just needs a break. I asked several times if there was anyone else she was interested in. She swears up and down that there isn't anyone else, she just needs time to look at what she needs. I call into work because I don't feel like crying in front of my coworkers and go home crushed. I gave it a couple hours and called her. I broke down, sobbed and begged for another chance. I received a definitive no. I asked if she was going out with her co-workers and friends and she said yes, but she won't see me. I decide to go crawl inside a bottle and try to give her space, believing we will make it work. Cut to yesterday she calls me saying we need to meet. I meet her at a park and it's all over her face. She breaks down admitting she fooled around with the gym teacher at her school. When pressed, I came to find they went back to his place, made out for awhile and he fingerbanged her. This was especially painful for me on a few levels. One, she has always said she doesn't enjoy the feeling of getting fingered. Very rarely would she let me perform that particular sexual act, and it always ended with her asking me to stop. Two, this was the exact same scenario that played out in her previous relationship! She cried and begged me to forgive her. She told me it was different this time because she has never felt this way about anyone. I told her calmly to get the eff out of my car and left her sobbing in the park. Since then she has continued to contact me asking for my forgiveness and another shot at our relationship. She said many times she would do anything to get back with me, will never betray my trust again. She offered to let me go through her phone and emails until I feel comfortable that she will remain faithful to me. Additionally, she promised I could dictate when and where she could go with her co-workers, because she works with the guy she messed around with. She even went so far as to offer to move away with me if I so chose. That was surprising because it was a point of contention earlier in our time together. She says she can't live without me. She told me that she will do anything to make us work. At this point, I don't know what to do. I don't see me checking her phone and telling her not to go out with her friends resulting in a successful relationship. I want her to hurt like I do. I want to simultaneously never see her again and envelop her in my arms. I want to die, and I want to live, live up to my potential to show us both what she is missing. I can't help but still love her. Sorry for making this so long. Any advice would be appreciated. Should I stay or should I go?Summary:
Summarize: Honestly, I don't see the point of even trying to create balance between the "classes". Unlike most games, here you can change from mage to melee just by replacing your equipment. Therefore I consider these classes to be more like tools, not identities. Trying to balance them is like trying to balance your toolbox. Well, let's make the screwdriver a bit more heavy like the hammer, the plyers a bit more pointy, like the screwdriver... ...and you end up with a clumsy set of tools. For me, the only sort of balancing that would make sense is creating environments/opportunities/opponents when one class has clear adventage over the other three. So the most effective class would be: always choosing the right one. If you want to stick with one, fine, have it your way, but it's not the most effective.Summary:
Summarize: i'm going to try and keep this as short as possible. i love my boyfriend, and i know he loves me; that's not the problem or in question in any way. we have been together about 10 months, and have had a LOT of ups and downs in the last 5 or so. due to some things, he has lost some trust in me, and that's perfectly acceptable. i understand where he is coming from. we have talked about moving to arizona together in january '13. i have always thought i was a long term, committed relationship type of person, but as of late, i feel like maybe i'm not ready to settle down. i've thought of how it'd be to move by myself, and i'm not completely torn apart when i see myself without him. i feel like that indicates something. i have a history of depression, anxiety, and self-mutilation that i'm not completely healed from, coupled with the fact that i recently learned that i won't be able to have kids without fertility treatment. i have lots of emotional baggage. i don't want to be a burden, but he assures me that he wants to work through it all together. i guess i'm trying to find a way to be completely certain that i should be with him. he is aware of my swaying in certainty and i know it hurts him. i can't keep hurting him. if i'm not for him, i'd rather figure it out and just hurt him once more as opposed to stringing him along with some false hope. there is a lot more to our relationship that i am not adding in here, for the sake of space and ease of reading; i'm just giving the highlights.Summary:
Summarize: Wild guess here, but he may feel some pressure to work with you to deal with his grief, and he is not up for that. I'm not saying that you're applying any pressure, but that simply being in a relationship usually means that one cannot shutdown and process internally. Let him know that you understand that he is grieving and is working through that. He may want to hear you say that he should not feel obligated to share while he goes through this.Summary:
Summarize: Posted this on another thread but it is more relevant here Last year, to celebrate the new year, my friends and I went to the beach, a friend has a house there... We have done this a couple of times, but this time was "special" because our friend turned 18... So his parents serve us a little bit of wine, they have a toast and then leave us to eat dinner... Another friend says "tonight will be just like The Hangover....lol jut kidding." Little did we know he was right... We go down to the beach, and get our drink on... Needless to say we all got super hammered. Our friend who turned 18 though was really sad, because he said he wanted to hook up with this girl and then another friend made out with her... So he was shitfaced, and making a fool of himself, so I tell him " hey lets go sit" and he got mad and grabbed a thick ass stick and threw it and it just so happenned to land on my face... Drunken me of course thought he did it all on purpose... So I let him be and storm off pissed as shit... Then, at 6 am we all decide we were going up to the house to get some rest... So we all up gather at the disco but wait... Our just recently turned 18 friend, lets call him Mike, was MIA, he was the one who was sad and angry because another friend hooked up with a girl he wanted to hook up with... Anyways, we all knew of what he was capable of doin drunk... Reckless shit... We searched for about an hour, nowhere to be found. We call his cell, someone picks up, we are all glad cause we think it is him, it is not, he had left his cell back at the house... We all seriously thought he had gone to take a swim drunk as shit in the ocean ( he did this last year, luckily we were all there and able to stop him from getting in ) and he mightt have drowned or something... About and hour later, a friend who had stayed back at the house because he had gotten sick said Mike's dad found him passed out on the balcony... His father did not make a big deal out of it... But we did not want his mother to find out because she would throw a fit... In the end, I was supposed to go back home with Mike because he lived real close to my house, ended going back with another friend to his place which was in no way close to mine, becuase his dad adviced me to becuae his mother was going to question me... Scariest moment of my life....Summary:
Summarize: This is my job. Exactly what I do isn’t really important….as this stat sheet shows. There is nothing that I do that couldn’t be automated. I spend days performing tasks a computer could do in less than a second. What makes me even more sad is knowing that I’ve taken programming classes and graduate level courses, coded a little project to display journal previous and next title info via a cell phone scanning a QR code. I’ve also pitched building some XSLT crosswalks for automating creating MARC records for electronic Theses and Dissertations. But making these tick marks instead of thinking or being creative is apparently what my employer wants me to do. Now, if we had employees working at this “level”, I could understand getting turned down. But the reality is that work is piling up at this midrange level because one group only wants to pose and have meetings with each other while they trap another group of people into working at trivial tasks. I guess this makes sure that the group in power never feels threatened, but the long term cost is “infrastructure rot”. Yes, I read Dilbert daily…living it is making me sick though. But at least Dilbert earn enough money that he could live on his own. If I didn’t have a spouse, I’d be at risk for living in my car. Thinking is limited to faculty only, but in reality they aren’t really given any autonomy either. Otherwise, I’d buy the stupid degree/credential so that I’d be given permission to think. (Heck, you only need a master’s degree and one with a fluff curriculum.) There’s such a profound staff vs faculty divide it can literally be measured in what I would call “pettiness events”. For instance, one would think that whoever comes in first in the morning would prop open the door as expected for the department. Nope. If a faculty member is first, they’ll unlock the door, but actually using the doorstop is a staff “job”. Furthermore, the stacks and bound journals must now be considered a closed collection because what little money we have is spent on marketing/branding the library and kissing up to wealthy patrons and “famous” local citizens via specialty collections that will see little or no use. But hey…they sound so fancy when the university mentions them in a blurb on the website! Get another job? In rural USA? Without an exact-match credential set? Buy another set of credentials and take on student loans again at 50 years old? I’m starting to wrap my brain around accepting that I’m destined to become one of the laid off. ….the surplus population. I know there’s probably hundreds of thousands (or millions) of “us” out there, just in the USA alone. We could have been real contributors to society, but there’s a strong possibility that we already are (or one day will be) mocked as leeches on the welfare state. But since that support network is crumbling….Summary:
Summarize: Okay well in pretty sure literally no one but you took it as a 'joke'. How was it even a joke though? You didn't understand the reference, someone told you the wrong thing and it seemed like you thought he was right... Where is the joke there? Seriously? Other than the fact that it turns out you know he was wrong, which really isn't that funny because obviously people aren't going to think 'oh he's given credit to someone who told him the wrong thing, he must be kidding because no one ever believes people who lie to them about something they stated they aren't sure about.'.Summary:
Summarize: I was 8(ish). A bunch of guys were teasing my friend and I on our way home from school the day before. They didn't even know us, they were just being mean, throwing stones etc. One of them called us bitches. When the principal asked about it the next day he asked me what they said and if they called us names. I said one called us the b-word. The principal told me to use the actual word. I'd never said that word in my life! That was the scariest part. I felt so naughty just for saying it! (I'm 22 now and still don't swear often - even typing it feels kind of weird...)Summary:
Summarize: Will do! What type of oil should I put on them to help them cast better/ work better? I've been fishing all my life, but I was taught by my papaw who grew up with cane poles and the sort so I'm still a bit of a novice when it comes to what gear works best for the job.Summary:
Summarize: Two of my friends and I were playing Smash Brothers in one of our basements in high school, while his mother hosted a book club meeting upstairs. A few of the book club members had brought their children, who had found their way into the basement and were playing ping-pong nearby. One of my friends had something awful befall him in the game, which happened fairly often as he was awful at it, and yelled out, "GOD-FUCKING DAMMIT!!" He then looked over at the children playing ping-pong, who were all under the age of ten, and said, "I mean...SHUCKS DARNSY!"Summary:
Summarize: as a heroin addict, I will tell you that coming off of heroin and STAYING off the shit is the hardest thing I've ever tried to do. I'll get some clean time under my belt (1 month here and there) but I'll always go back to the drugs. I'm at the point where I don't want to do it anymore, but I keep doing it. as I am still an addict and do not know what will work for long periods of time, I will tell you what will NOT work for sure. If he is detoxing and has legs, he WILL find a way to go get high. If he's spending his time with people that are using, he WILL get high. I've found that keeping busy is the best thing to do for an addict. in AA/NA they say there are three alternative for the addict: Jails, institutions and death. I have experience with all three, and jail was just recently about a month ago. For the first time ever, I had to detox without the ability to go and get high and I can tell you it was the worst thing I have ever experienced. Jail straightens alot of people out because of how bad the detox is. it's when they get out of jail and get some sobriety where they forget just how bad the detox was, and they go out and relapse. it's a viscous cycle man, it almost feels like you're fighting a losing battle. Stop spending money on rehab facilities, true change comes from within. if he wants to stop bad enough, he will. if you are going to send him to rehab or somewhere to detox, for the love of god do not let him leave there and go back to the same environment he was using in.. that's asking for a relapse. I could go on with this shit forever, so i'll just leave you with this: Unfortunately, there ain't shit you can do about this. hope that he gets caught stealing something or selling something and is forced to sit in jail for a little bit so he can think about his life and how awesome heroin has made it. It might sound terrible, but at least jail offers guaranteed sobriety.. not to mention it's one of the better three alternatives.Summary:
Summarize: You have missed the point, and therefore your complaint will land on deaf ears. If you spend $100 on an office chair, you're going to get a chair that will be fine for up to 20 hours a week for 5 years, but at 40 hours/week, you will need to replace it within a few years, max. People have paid $700 and more on office chairs and found that they have saved money on back problems and that the product has lasted for many, many, many years. Therefore, it's a perfcetly durable, quality and practical product, especially if you work from home and in front of a screen for 40+ hours/week. If you are a foodie, you are going to be concerned about food temperatures and want quick read thermometers. There are many cheap, easily breakable low-quality thermometers out there. A $5 thermometer in this context is not practical - by the time you get a temperature reading, your meat may be over-cooked. Therefore, something that offers what you want at half normal price and that is proven to be highly durable and of high quality is clearly a BIFL item. The same goes for the frying pan. If you are somebody who is looking to buy high-end pans (which the OP was), it's likely that they enjoy cooking and spend a lot of time in the kitchen - it's obvious they're not interested in something to make a grilled cheese sandwich. In that context, $150 for a frying pan might well be the most durable and high-quality product they ever buy. It might have perfect heat distribution and is therefore more practical. It might be for the sort of recipes OP is trying, other pans just won't be good enough. For the kind of use they're putting their pans through, anything lesser might be thrown away after just 12 months (I know our cheap frying pans last about 12-18 months), so within 10 years OP could be into "profit", if not sooner. The thread about snap-on tools and the safety razor are perfect BIFL items: the thread was about products that have a lifetime warranty. In other words, if you buy those products and they ever fail, you get a replacement under warranty for the cost of shipping at most. I can't imagine a product more durable or of proven high quality than one that comes with a lifetime warranty from the manufacturer. That is practical in the sense that you pay for it once, you're never paying for it ever again. That is perfect practical BIFL mentality: it's not a gadget, it's not some new trendy gizmo, it's something your kids and grandkids will still get use out of. The binoculars thing - you've misquoted and misrepresented the comment. The comment concerned a pair of $150 binoculars that are particularly durable and practical and high quality: the perfect BIFL item. "If money is no object", they continue, "the $2,000 [binoculars] are THE ones to get". Note, the qualification. They're saying if you want to go crazy bling on the optics they are superb, but the Pentax are almost as good and will stand up to heavy use. What isn't practical about that?Summary:
Summarize: Honestly this last patch has been the most poorly thought out set of balance changes i've seen in a very long time. after all of the talk of melee being notoriously weaker then ranged in this game (except in the cases of tanks) riot starts nerfing melee assassins who are already performing at an average level in solo queue, and FAR below average in competitive..? what? not only are melee assassins weak in competitive play and are regularly bypassed for ranged mages in the VAST majority of games, but they are also average in solo queue. lets take a look at champions "tweaked" this patch.. Fizz: a champion who's pretty much rarely/never played professionally that literally has ONLY one function (deals damage, no hard cc, no utility, not tanky) and has an average 51% ish win rate in solo queue, gets nerfed into being completely UNPLAYABLE. this is not an exaggeration. fizz is not playable right now. Akali: a champion who is NEVER played competitively and that literally has ONLY one function (deals damage, no hard cc, no utility, not tanky) gets her range nerfed and her bread and butter burst combo outright REMOVED from the game. Zed: arguably the STRONGEST and MOST POPULAR of all the melee assassins in the game (definitely the best competitively) and who was probably deserving of an actual nerf, ends up with the most meaningless nerf out of the 3... a minor attack speed nerf, resulting in slightly less turret killing power and slightly less dps in extended fights Ahri: a RANGED champion who is REGULARLY and CONSISTANTLY played in competitive, who has a solid above average solo queue winrate, and the most options in terms of playing in any style she chooses (passive/safe wave clearing, roaming, dueling, aggressive, poking, etc) gets MULTIPLE buffs. presumably under the guise of "compensation for the removal of DFG", an item which PLENTY of champions can effectively use, and yet only ahri gets a "compensation" buff for it, as if the champion wasn't functional without it. we've all seen people use DFG and make it work on tons of champs. ahri, leblanc, syndra, fizz, katarina, lissandra, etc. now, i want to make a very clear point on this entire concept of "counterplay" that riot has been obsessed with recently. this game is about DECISION MAKING and TEAM PLAY. if you get caught alone by a zed, a fizz, an akali, or another melee assassin, you SHOULD die. there shouldnt BE counterplay unless they make a mistake or your teammates save you. why? because if a melee assassin cant outduel people in 1v1s or do more damage then a ranged champion then there is literally NO advantage/reason to play a melee champion in this game unless you're a tank. ever. as an example to point out how ridiculous the recent "balance" changes are, how does it make sense for an ahri to be able to outduel a fizz and deal similar damage in a 1v1? she has similar damage, access to hard CC, better mana costs, better AND safer wave clear, better teamfighting, a ranged auto attack for csing and harassing, better sustain, ability to siege and NEVER has to risk melee range commitment. almost every ranged mage has these advantages Another point i want to bring up is that when people complain about assassins they have a bad habit of only thinking of games where the assassin gets fed and is running over their team. what if your teammates hadnt fed him? what if he was 0/0/0? would he still be one shotting you or 2v1ing you if you were ready for it? probably not. sure, if he catches you off guard 1v1 you'd still die or have to run, but thats the whole purpose of assassins.. 9/10 times the reason an assassin is snowballing is because you have a bad teammate who misplayed and fed him. thats how this game works. it has nothing to do with the champions involved. your teammate fed someone, so that person is stronger then he should be and he takes over the game, it happens all the time, not just with assassins. you just "feel" it more when you get caught by a fed assassin because you die quickly anyway, im getting pretty tired of all of these balance changes that have been happening under the guise of "counterplay", because the majority of them dont seem to have anything to do with counterplay. it just seems to be trying to appease bad solo queue players who never group in this TEAM game and constantly get caught out alone, then blame the champions involved instead of their bad decision to be alone at the 25 min mark. also, random side note, build paths for melee damage dealers SUCK. they are almost always less efficient then the typical morello/raba/void combo that ranged mages use, or the paths ADCs use. its annoying how streamlined tank/adc/mage build paths are, while melee carry build paths are sloppy and scatteredSummary:
Summarize: Its not my problem you have depend on the hand outs of others to survive. To be honest, I couldn't give a single fuck about people who depend on tips. You know why? Because I don't have to. Also, I worked service before H.R. 5970, which would explain my ignorance to it. But, still, its not my problem.Summary:
Summarize: How about we start with damaging the relationship with the people who were willing to vouch for her (who also happen to be related to a friend), followed by lying to a landlord she may be relying on in the future for a good reference? She is currently very dependant on these people for stable housing, it seems unwise to be pulling shit like this with them. OP, just get your sister to explain to these people that she needs a bit of time to find a place where Ziggy is welcome. Worst case pay for some boarding or temporary foster care. Just find a place where she and the Zigster are both welcome and where his presence isn't going to cause conflict. Lying to get her way may seem convenient but people around her may catch on. People will treat her very differently after that.Summary:
Summarize: Google Play tried to charge my card at 3am last night but I was short £1 because I'd transferred too much into my savings account. FFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUU! I've now transfered enough money back but fuck knows how long it will be before they try to charge my card again.Summary:
Summarize: I have TMJ problems, and I have for about 5 years. At one point it go so bad that my jaw locked shut for 4 months. I went through 3 different oral surgeons that wanted to do surgery on me, but my parents were uncomfortable with a 16 year-old going through that kind of surgery. We found a doctor that takes a nonsurgical approach, and I am currently in a splint that repositions my jaw. I could go into detail about what's happening with your jaw, but this post is already long enough.Summary:
Summarize: Those who frequent RDD on indiaspeaks will know what this post is about but still allow me to fill you in about what went down last night. There i was in RDD where hyodo wrote something about prophecies and fortune tellers, so i commented "whats my future in this sub?" to which another user asked for a pic of my palms. Now pls to note, i didn't know this user has the mental capacity of a retarded 3 year old who will get so so so offended by a pic of jizz in someone's hand that he will go and cry to the mods about how its "sexual harassment". WHAT THE FUCK! You're terming a pic which i posted just to elicit some laughs with no malice in my heart towards you as sexual harassment? The pic was taken down within 5 minutes of me posting it and i also apologised to the mod as well for not tagging it as NSFW. Still nothing to lose my shit over even though this guy accused me of sexual harassment . But then this assole instigates me by telling another user what a loser i am. So its not just enough that he accuses me of a serious crime like sexual harassment but he also wants to bash me on the thread as well,main chutiya toh hun nahi ki iski sunnunga so i hit back at him all the while trying to be a a little civil(at first) but ofcourse like the child he is, he retorts back with "randi madarchod..feed your jizz to your mom" Umm, so this is not as offensive as the pic i shared? Considering its not r/bakchodi. So fast forward a few minutes and this guy goes on to write one long ass para basically telling me that my parents hate me,my friends dont like me, how im a "piece if shit" punk teenager blah blah, but what really got his goat was that he failed to rile me up and even got called out on his remarks by another user. This fucker goes to town about how he was "offended",how it was sexual harassment, how it was some user who uses different alts to harass him etc etc. and he not only messages all the mods but also keeps telling all other users this through PM. Pls to note while all of this is going on, im still clueless about it. Its only this morning when a mod messaged me that i got to know the whole story. And if it hadn't been for this mod, i would've already got banned without so much as hearing my side of the story. Pls to note again,the pic was taken down within 5 minutes so majority of the people have no idea what it was and this fucker(crybaby) takes full advantage of this and tells everyone that it was a self taken pic(implying i jerked off,took a pic and then posted here) and everyone just laps it up. Pitch forks were out and they wanted to ban me all based on hearsay and what this "offended" little fucker told them. Isko toh randia ka mod bnao bhaiyio, apt hain. Gets offended easily, is quick in reporting to mods and obviously a chutiya.Summary:
Summarize: Okay, so I'm not trying to be a bitch here. I'm genuinely interested to know the reasons. Pretty much all of the engineers I've met at U of I are just so arrogant about it, and no offense, but you guys (as in the r/uiuc community) kinda come off that way too. It's like people who aren't engineers are just worthless. I know we're a great engineering school and all, but face it, the whole world can't be engineers. 1)We would die out because nobody would be getting laid and 2)There are more roles to be filled in society than engineering ones. Sorry for this. Just wanted to hear some other opinions. Also, kinda drunk.Summary:
Summarize: ugh. this is a gross one and TMI but I had a baby last year. A couple of months after I got my first post partum period. My OB said it would probably be lighter and it was. So I set out for a trip to the mall. Now I should probably say that I was at least 20lbs heavier than I am now, holding a baby because she refused to sleep in her stroller, and I was sweating my balls off in a poorly chosen outfit (I was dressed for 50 degrees and it was more like 70). So I'm sweating and noticing a large amount of ...for lack of a better phrase... swamp ass. Not really thinking much of it I decide to leave and head into the parking lot. I start noticing more and more wetness but Im thinking, okay im walking pretty quickly in the hot sun. I put baby in the car, get in and go WTF. Red all the way down to my knees. Yep. OB was wrong, my period was super heavy.Summary:
Summarize: Im sorry, $170?!?!?!?! with the asurion insurance to get a new phone? HOLY FUCKING CHRIST, They really fucking rob you now a days My blackberry storm used to cost me $50 to replace everytime it shit the bed with Asurion. Then They charted me $80 to replace my Droid X because the camera button broke. I never filed a claim on my Gnex, but my sister paid $80 to have her Moto Razor X replaced (I think that was the model, claimed to be the best android battery lifed phone at the time ) after she cracked the screen.. Now they want $170 deductible? Just cancel that fucking shit, man what a rip off. I cancelled mine. All that money you pay them you could just buy a new phone, plus its water resistant and with the $20 tempered glass protector, you dont really need them anymore. Jesus, $170 to get a phone that verizon charges you $99 for is INSANESummary:

Summarize: The only way to get HIV is if you let the sperm go into your blood stream, which basically means you have to floss really hard right before you blow him and just let the entire load sit in your mouth for a good 30 seconds. If you swallow, you're safer since your stomach acid burns it all away. If all you did was taste the precum (lick it and sort of have it in your mouth then spit out), I'm 100% you're fineSummary:

HP/Valve said we would get silencers back when we were in beta. So, who knows if we will get them tomorrow, or in nineteen hundred years. And even then, we may or may not have to engage in some holy warfare/war crimes.Summary:
Summarize: Okay so I've just gotten a real job for the first time in probably 2 or 3 years and 2 days into it I'm about ready to quit. Yes it is quite physically demanding, but the pay is decent, and I have done labor jobs in the past. I get to work and all I think about is not being there and how I should just quit. Also, at least lately, I feel like I have anxiety when I sleep even though I'm exhausted and should just pass out. Ill go to bed at a reasonable 11pm and wake up at like 4 or something and just dread work in the morning.Summary:
Summarize: but that's the thing. many feminists (at least in my experience) just want to lose what they don't like, and keep everything else. for example, if women achieved equal pay, it would a great victory, but if they were included in the draft, it would be a tragedy and a war on women. i realize this isn't representative of the entire feminist population, but in my experience, there is a fair number of them. it pisses me off to no end when they want to be treated "like a lady" but the second you use the word bitch, they go into a rant about how that demeans women. what i'm trying to say is that they only want things level where it benefits them, i suppose you could say they want to have their cake and eat it too, and then bitch about how as women, it demeans them to make cakes.Summary:
Summarize: I'm currently doing a euro trip with 8 other friends. While we were in Amsterdam one of the girls had her drink spiked and was abducted. It was the most stressful experience of my life. I ended up bursting into tears with my best friend, and yelling out how disgusting the human race can be. Luckily a local got in contact with the abductees and convinced them to let her go. The police were fucking no hope at all.Summary:
Summarize: When you are on birth control, you don't have normal periods - you have a withdrawal bleed caused by a dip in hormones. Hormones, particularly estrogen, can be stored in fat. So if you have been on birth control, your body has likely stored away excess hormones in your fat cells. Now that you are losing weight, your body is breaking down fat cells and using them for energy, thereby metabolizing the stored hormones and keeping your body from having a noticeable enough drop in hormones to keep you from having a withdrawal bleed.Summary:
Summarize: Jax' complete disregard for authority or rules, and the mystery behind him. He had no Judgement or Reflection, suddenly this guy no one has heard of before is just there . Not only is he there, but he makes it clear that he's the best Champion by a long shot, so they put special restrictions on him. As a giant "fuck you" to the man , he mocks their petty handicaps and starts using a lamppost as a weapon. Nothing slows him down, he still stomps, despite the fact that he has no weapon, no history, no faction, no confirmed species even. He has purple skin, only a few fingers and toes, and he probably has a bunch of blue eyes, but there's no way of knowing that for sure due to the hood. A couple of hypothesis stand out to me. His lack of background and his clothing cause some people to think he's the world's most badass minion. It would also explain the lack of Judgement and Reflection, because obviously minions don't go through that process to participate in League matches, right? My favorite theory though is that he is somehow related to Baron Nashor. The visual similarities are apparent, and they are respectively the strongest monster and champion. MY wild idea is that Jax IS Baron Nashor. The monsters in Summoners Rift are just copies of real monsters that are summoned for the matches. Baron in particular isn't necessarily accurate because the only evidence that the League had of the creature was a scale and verbal descriptions from tales. When the Summoner's Rift was constructed, the real Baron just dissappeared . What purple skinned, blue eyed creature just appeared in the League RIGHT after that? BOOMSummary:
Summarize: It's Sunday night. Hubby and I are chilling on the couch, watching Blacklist. The only sounds are coming from the TV in this room, and (faintly) the dryer in the laundry room. In about 10 minutes, hubby is going to put his head on my lap because that's how he likes to watch movies late at night. I love nights like this. I wouldn't trade in spending time with this amazing guy for a crying, needy small human, and idk why anyone who has bingoed me believes my current arrangement needs to be "improved"Summary:
Summarize: Quite a difficult one. For me it's impossible to pin down a 'BRAVE moment', I cherish so many memories form my time in Brave. Although it's interesting to see how what you appreciate as a player evolves over time. My most endearing memories of Rahadalon are newbie to the core. Getting on my first killmail with a Merlin, seeing my first titan (a PL Avatar) in Nakah, Kill: Motre (Revelation), Asking if it's worth fitting guns to suicide tackle , going into a WH for the first time and having Andrew Jester lose half the fleet, 'need people on the Mendori gate there's freighter coming through', the RvB war, helping found Brave dojo with Hail Sagan, getting my first T2 ship - a hound - for ratting battleships in curse... the list is endless. These are not things I would wish to repeat, but I enjoyed greatly at the time. In Barleguet I feel that I actually 'learned how to play', with most experiences being something I can relate to today. The endless POS bashing with LePetite ]( discovering the joys of POS reactions with some friends, joining my first social channels (most of which I'm still in today), calling 'Blue ICe is primary' whilst FCing an anti-leadership fleet on Kennick sun, lighting a cyno so that we could kill SNUFF dreads that dropped on NOC's carrier camp, flying an unkillable Scorpion in Megaladon fleets that [still has a top place on my killboard years later]( [getting my first capital ship]( becoming 'space middle class' [via DED sites]( and starting to PLEX my accounts for the first time... Again, not things I would necessarily like to repeat, but are fond memories nonetheless. Sendaya/Catch was different. Aside from the [extremely fun deployment speculation]( I went in smugly ahead of everyone else, personally deploying with a few cap pilots in suitcase carriers half a day before the announcement was made. Which pretty much defined my Catch experience in a nushell. For the first time I was 'at the top' of the corp in terms of experience and SP, newbie frigates roams didn't interest me, they exasperated me. That's not to say Catch wasn't fun, I just felt that the majority of Brave 'ideals' were conflicting with my own. [Skynetting inties in V-3]( [Watching the hilarious conclusion to Fanfest '14 together on comms]( dropping for the first time with Brave caps to help set timers, almost losing my archon as Levi Scutter forgets to bring warp core stabs in his Nid, [becoming the alliance mogul on DED sites]( [enjoying Brave first T2 cruiser fleets]( having some of the most fun I've had in Eve piloting an Onyx in said fleets, etc etc. Of course, [Catch is where I left Brave]( for the reasons I put in that post. I'll always enjoy helping people in Brave Dojo and chatting to friends made during my time in corp, but I just feel that Brave as an alliance is no longer for me. Also fuck that got preachy. Sorry.Summary:

Summarize: We have been together for about two years, in the beginning the kid was okay, then when me and my boyfriend had started having some trouble he just automatically hated me (super immature) and literally just wouldnt talk to me, was a complete jerk right to my face. this past summer we broke up for just about the summer and then decided to get back together. during that time he literally slept over and spent every SINGLE DAY with this kid... they are 26 years old.. now that we are back together i dont hesitate to say something when his friend pisses me off, but he literally never sees it. when i bring something up he'll either brush it off and defend his friend saying "thats just how he is, thats why he doesnt have a girlfriend" or "ive already said something to him about it a million times" but he will NEVER defend me in front of his friend... is it just me or is this relationship a bit extreme? and i am not the only one who thinks this, all of the friends that we hang out with think their relationship is pretty weird and they are together and texting ALL the time.. i know people have their best friends and shit, but am i wrong for being pissed off when he doesnt defend me or say something to the kid?Summary:
Summarize: I stumbled onto it. I had leveled 3 or 4 toons to Anor Londo(ish) trying to decide which playstyle I liked the best. Ended up going back to my first toon(dex/int in case you were wondering). Right after Anor Londo I cleared Duke's and Seath. I decided to take a break from the lord soul areas after dealing with Duke's and the Crystal Cave(beautiful, yet aggravating) so, I ventured back to Darkroot to Sif and on my way I was thinking "Hmm, have I killed the hydra and freed Dusk yet?". The DLC did not even occur to me as I had avoided spoilers fairly well and did not realize Dusk was related. Anywho, turned out I had killed the hydra. I went to Dusk's summon spot and did not see her sign. "Hmm, must not have freed her yet.". Headed to the spot, saw some swirly purple shit and was like "Huh. This is new." And that's all she wrote.Summary:
Summarize: Hey there everyone :) My name is Maeve, I'm 17 and MTF. For the past 11 years, I've known I was trans, and the feelings have only grown stronger and stronger. I still live with my parents, but I'm getting to that point of suppressing my emotions that I'm starting to feel like I can't keep on living like this. My mom won't allow anything of any kind until I'm done with college in 4 years [including name changes, clothing, hormones, the whole bit] I just dont know what to do anymore. I've talked with her countless times but she just won't listen. Any and all advice would mean the world. Thank youSummary:

Summarize: So my parents moved to Hawaii for 2 years for a job, and wanted someone to watch over their house. It just so happened that my friend wanted to get out of the state she was living in for most of her life, so I gave her the opportunity to move up to the lovely pacific northwest and rent out my parent's home (and the home I grew up in) for real cheap (200 a month, pretty bitchin deal right???) Now I know that my friend is a bit controlling, over emotional and moody as hell but I figure we can work through it and she can respect living in my home. This puts me in an awkward position because I have to play landlord to my friend. As soon as she gets here she starts arguing with me about how we're going to decorate the living room. She demands that she wants it to feel like home and not like she's away, I had to tell her that it was my living room too and she got all pissy. She gets angry when I spend time with my boyfriend. We got in another argument because of this, and she said that it was my responsibility to keep her company and entertained. As if she's still visiting or something. I let her know that I'm not going to put off my life because of her, and that if I did spend as much time home as she wanted me to, she would get sick of me. And low and behold, the weekends I stay home she starts being a bitch because she's sick of looking at me. At this point, I don't feel comfortable in my own home. I wake up, go to work or school, go to my boyfriends to spend a couple hours, and come home and hang out with her. But as soon as I walk through the door you can cut the air with a knife. It's like she's angry because I'm living my own life. She threatens to move back to her home state. I don't say anything to her because I don't really know why it's a threat. If she doesn't want to be here, then by all means quit torturing me and leave!!! I go out with her on weekends. I introduced her to my friends and even go and pick her up so she can chill with us and she's not stuck at the house. Just tonight when I got home from work and my boyfriends, she was in a pissy mood. The light in my bedroom burnt out the other day and so I ask her if she minds if i turn the light on in the living room (she's in there watching hulu on the computer). She huffs and puffs and ask me why I need to turn the light on, I say because it's dark in here and I need to do some work. She snaps back with, I HAVE A HEADACHE! So I say, um, okay and go back into my room and turn on the closet light to work by. She get's up, says, FINE YOU CAN HAVE YOUR LIGHT ON! and slams the door to her room. Any ideas on what to tell her? I guess I know what to say, but how do I approach her? This technically is my house while my parents are away and if she's going to continue to treat me like this would it be wrong to ask her to leave? EDIT: To make things clear, there is no written lease, only a verbal agreement and month to month rent. EDIT II: We just "talked." She started crying and playing victim. I told her that she needs to quit treating me like shit and quit making me feel unwelcome in my home. She says that I'm not "home enough" to make me feel "unwelcome..." but then goes on to explain how I come home at night, am home in the morning, and hang out with her on weekends. I think she's a little delusional. I told her if she didn't want to be here then she should move back to her home and she says that she "couldn't." She says she doesn't "have the money." The IRS is fucking her for not claiming her per cap (why the fuck she tried to pull on on the IRS, I don't know. This is the kind of person I'm dealing with.) and she still hasn't found a job despite being here for a month. Why? Because she's being picky. She doesn't even have a high school degree and she's trying to be picky. I can understand that she's getting cabin fever but, I'm done playing nice. EDIT III deleted the stuff about my light bulb because some of you are just as annoying and nitpicky as my roommate.Summary:
Summarize: I am in Silver 1 and really trying to get to Gold but it is even harder whenever people simply quit due to some people talking to you in a "rude" way. It's the internet! I won't sugarcoat this and I will say that sometimes I'm that person that tells you, "Dude seriously, dont try 1v5 the team, have some map awareness ffs". Then, let's say in this scenario, the person gets butthurt and says something along the lines of "I'm not having fun anymore, just gonna feed, f*** this trash team", when we were only 5-12 (We could still comeback). In the end, if the person is harassing you, there is always an ignore button (Of course there is a fine line between telling you what to do in a "rude" way and actually bullying you). Another subject is when jungler takes blue from an 0-4 mid, obviously, the mid will just feed it to the enemy mid and keep matters worse but what does our mid do when this happens? "Omg, jungler didnt give me blue gg afk". Just bothers me that people wont take ranked as seriously as I do and simply give up or quit when things look rough.Summary:
Summarize: This will get buried, but once when I was about 25, my stepdad and I were on our way home in the last hour stretch of a road trip in his old beater of a pickup truck. My mom had been waiting up for us, and I think it was about 12:30 in the morning when we realized that we were about to run out of gas. We called AAA and they said they'd locate us and bring us some gas within the hour. As such, we pulled over and decided to call my mom to let her know we were going to be late. Then, my stepdad had the bright idea of playing a prank on her just to see what she would do. When I asked him what to say, he said "I don't know, just make something up!" So, I put my phone on speaker and dialed the number to my parents' house. She answered the phone and asked how everything was going. Said we needed to hurry up because she was tired of waiting and wanted to go to bed. Blah blah blah, bullshit for a minute, until I tell her "oh, we're going to be a little late because we ran out of gas and are waiting for AAA to show up." She asks what happened and we say we just misjudged how much gas it would take to get home, and forgot to stop at an appropriate point before there wouldn't be anymore gas stations for awhile. She flips out a little bit, asking if we're okay, which is normal I guess for moms who are just waiting for the rest of their family to join them safely in the nest. She was concerned about how much food and water we had, in case we had to sleep there all night (?? I don't even know), and during her billions of questions, it dawned on me: I told her -- "Mom, we're going to be fine. AAA said they'd be here in about 45 minutes, and that's plenty of time before the oxygen in the cab runs out. My stepdad crammed his fist in his mouth as best he could to stifle his laughter, because my mom audibly gasped and said "WHAAAT?? How long does that usually take?". So, I ran with it and said "It depends on the make and model of the vehicle, but since this is an old truck, it has a failsafe mechanism that when the gas tank is emptied, all the windows and doors lock and seal so they can't be opened. At some point that means that if there are people inside, they'll run out of air. We're guessing we have about 90 minutes before we should start getting worried." At this point, she is totally crying and we are barely able to contain our cackling, because she starts giving us tearful, desperate tips on how to conserve oxygen: "Try to take slow, shallow breaths! Or go to sleep!" "Don't talk on the phone too long or you'll use up the oxygen faster!" "If worse comes to worst, just break the window!" Anyway, by the end of it she's hysterically crying and begging to talk to my stepdad, since she believes it's possible it'll be the last time she ever talks to him. Tears are absolutely rolling down his face, and he does his best to regain his composure long enough to pretend like he's really worried and will really miss her if anything bad happens. He starts telling her how much he loves her and has been thankful for all the years they've spent together, that she changed his life and he could never love anyone else as much as her. I am positively DYING by this point, because he's incorporated a skillful wheeze into the conversation after every other word, which is serving the dual purpose of driving my mom completely batshit with worry and myself deeper into the throes of laughter. After about 20 minutes of them having this super heartfelt conversation, the AAA guy shows up. My stepdad, without thinking, rolls down the window to talk to the guy, and my mom could hear it happening over the phone. All of a sudden she screams "WHAT THE FUCK?!" and my stepdad and I are completely helpless to the power of how funny it was. We burst out laughing so hard and tried to breathlessly explain what we told her to the AAA guy, who also started laughing. After she heard that, she was PISSED. She started screaming obscenities at us and told us not to even bother coming home because she would call the police. When we finally got there, she had taken all of the winter boots and shoes out of the hall closet, scattered them all over the foyer, and turned all the lights off so that we'd trip over them and fall on our faces when we got in the door. It has never, ever stopped being the funniest thing that has ever happened to our family. There were other incidents too, just not as good as that one. She didn't talk to either of us for a week after that. It was hilarious.Summary:

ATTENTION PEOPLE ENJOYING FAST FOOD I don't have anything agains it and you shouldn't give a shit about anyone that does, enjoy yourself, but I have experienced first hand what happens if you try to fuel your body on is stuff. inhale ONCE UPON A TIME blah blah blah I had a job that was 12 hours every day for straight labour in a noisy, dusty, hot, dangerous environment and it was exhausting, I eventually stopped making my lunches the day before I ate them and instead relied on those "microwave meals" that have the entire thing going on, like butter chicken, roast etc. they were great! 2 minute noodles and microwave meals, way less effort this is awesome. But then one day I almost fainted into a machine that was has rotating parts going unbeleivably fast, the food I was eating was technically food but it doesn't do anything to your body, [it's like I was eating nothing at all]( The next day when I ate just one sandwich it kept me going for the rest of the day.Summary:

Summarize: As we are yes, I can see corruption soiling even the best system that could possibly exist overtime. But a battle without end, is one still worth fighting. Like the war on drugs and the war on terrorism? :P My original point was that any alternative we come up with will be corrupted. Sure, the human population has domesticated itself quite a bit and restrained those darker tendancies, but they will always be there and we can barely control them. There are quite a few atheists here who would outright destroy all religion if they had the chance. They weigh their own opinions more than the rights of millions of people. That's the same dark tendancies we despise in religion.Summary:
Summarize: That's exactly why he's a pedantic little bitch. He knows, or should know if he's even half as clever as he thinks he is, that the advert is referring to vigor and vitality but takes petty delight in calling them stupid by assuming or pretending that they're referring to chemical energy. In his mind he's right because obviously they meant chemical energy. The reason they obviously meant that is because that would make him right and them wrong. That would make him clever. Maybe if he points out these "mistakes" often enough then the loneliness will go away.Summary:
Summarize: Time. Like you I felt I was supposed to like girls and as hard as I tried I just couldn't work out what my friends were on about. I had a very lonely period up until I was in my early 20s when I moved out of home and decided to just live life and see where it took me. I planned to start by going to a brothel to get it over and done with but it just never seemed right. Eventually I met some gay people and that did so I just kept doing that and many years later am very happy. I've never got around to having sex with a girl but I'm not saying I never would.Summary:
Summarize: It was the matinee hours during a very slow week day while working at the movies. A rather overweight woman comes hobbling in with her husband. Actually no; a morbidly obese lady. Anyways, they go to see the movie Battleship. About halfway through, I see her exit the theater, walks as fast as her fat legs can move her straight to her car. My co-worker and I find this slightly precarious. We decide to exit and sneak around stealthily to watch what she was up to without her husband. BAD IDEA. She began disrobing I kid you not (it was a struggle inside a car for a woman her size). Once completely naked, she gets out of the car, layers flapping and all. She proceeds to perform the fucking rain dance. In the middle of the parking lot . My friend and I were petrified yet laughing our asses off. We ran back in without her noticing and got her husband who was in the main area looking for his wife. We told him she was out there and all that we saw. His exact words were, "Oh dear god not again."Summary:
Summarize: Through the course of Minute Manning up the wasteland I came across what at first seemed like yet another dinky little farm settlement area. "There's Raiders" - "Ok I'll kill Raiders" - "Raiders be killed" - "Thanks, take this thing and we'll help the Minute Men now!". - same old same old. It wasn't until day time when I finished up with the quest that I actually noticed the bridge that the farm was under. Decided this was a good a place as any to test the vertical limits of the workshop - boy was I delighted! Not only can you build up to the bridge from the ground, but you can build on top of the bridge to a height about equal to the distance from the ground to the bridge. To me this is amazing, I'm already picturing a wall city built around the bridge, maybe even a canopy of buildings. Great view. [Summary:
Summarize: So I'm the guy that waited for 4 hours at Pickering TRU only for them to sell the Amiibo's the next day. As was explained in my previous posts they recieved them while I was waiting and did not sell them to me or anyone else who was waiting. In fact I was called back later that evening, literally 10 minutes after I left to tell me they had a Marth on hold for me. When I asked where the others were he said they did not receive any. The next day thanks to our Amiibros I found out they were selling them. I rushed over and saw no new Amiibos on the wall. A lady came in after me and instead of going to where the Amiibo's were displayed headed straight to an associate and asked for the new Amiibos. The associate then pulled them up from underneath the counter where they were hidden from view. When I asked her when they had recieved them the associate told me yesterday and that they were now sold out. Needless to say I was angry and called Customer Service to complain. They took my complaint and told me someone would call me back. Over a week passed and my wife called them once again to which they replied that they would "escalate" it and that I should receive a call soon.... Well last week I got the call from Moe I think who introduced himself as "Hey I am calling from TRU. You had a complaint or suggestion or something?" I told him the story once again to which he replied that he would try to get me a Pit and Villager Amiibo. He told me it may take a while as he did not know where he would get it from. I am now another week out and no call back or update. I will be calling on Wednesday to find out whats going on.Summary:
Summarize: I originally posted this at r/polyamory, because I didn't realize this subreddit existed. My husband and I - we are both men - are not sexually exclusive. Lately we have been hanging out with this new gentleman. It's our typical arrangement with third parties, which is basically friends-with-benefits. Except, I'm running into a problem. The dude seems to like my husband a lot more than me. The first night we hooked up, we were all drunk and he was very possessive of my husband and dismissive of me. Kissed my husband deeply, passionately then would give me a peck and go back to my husband. Pushed me away a couple of times. While I hate when this happens and how awkward it becomes, I rolled with it because, well, we're not new to this and I know it's not always ideal. However, the next time we were planning to hang out, I gently mentioned what we'd observed and that if he was only interested in my husband that was totally fine, but that he should let us know. I understand that right here may be one of the biggest variables. He was on the spot and may have not felt comfortable saying what he actually felt. That said, I really think I did a good job of making it clear that it was not a problem to say he preferred my husband, but he needed to say that if it was the case. Maybe he really wanted to but couldn't in that moment. I don't know. But he did say that he was interested in both of us, so we tried to proceed as normal.The other two times we've had sex have been sober and a bit more... egalitarian, but still he obviously leans towards my husband. When we all snuggle in bed, he only really tries to snuggle my husband. And lately we both realized that he never responds to my texts, calls, IMs or anything but responds to everything my husband sends him. So now I'm unsure of how to proceed. I don't have a problem with my husband having solo encounters with guys, so if that was what this person wanted, I might be okay with it. But he specifically said he didn't want that. However, his actions tell a different story and now I'm left confused and more than a little annoyed. They've now established this kind of bond, and I feel on the outside of it. My husband isn't pleased about this either, but doesn't know how to proceed. Wile I want to hang out with this guy, I feel uncomfortable about the idea, because I don't want to feel like a third wheel in my own relationship and I'm also kind of annoyed that he has ignored all my attempts at communication. It just seems kind of rude and unfriendly. I will admit that this is all made difficult by the fact that it seems like every person we know either loves us both equally or very obviously likes my husband better. Mostly it's equal, but there have been multiple people - friends, family and a bunch of sexual partners - who have obviously gravitated towards him over me. The opposite has never happened. No one has every showed a preference in me. Rationally, I understand that this doesn't matter and I try not to let it get to me. In five years, it really hasn't. But this one was just the straw that broke the camels back and it just bummed me out a bunch. My question is: how have you guys dealt with an imbalance like this? Further, have you had a third party claim interest in both of you but then behave like he is into only one of you? I really like this dude and would love to be his friend and/or fuckbuddy but I don't want to feel like a third wheel in my own relationship. I know my husband wants to hang out with him again in theory but is also really bothered by what's going on. Any thoughts would be very appreciated.Summary:
Summarize: I feel that you guys are giving way too much hate about russians. Everytime I get into a match and a russian opens his mouth, everyone goes bananas and mock him. If he chokes and fails to kill one, everyone put blames on him. Always complain the russians. I've met countless russians who have been very cooperative, some can be ragey and some can be very very ignorant. A couple of weeks ago, I was playing nuke and I had 3 russians and 1 dude(forgot the name of the country). It was 6-0 to the enemy team and this dude was sure angry about the russians because they barely got any kills and they haven't said a single thing, he sure complained a lot to the enemy team, then he asked me how I felt about them, I told him "I don't dislike russians but I dislike people who won't communicate". All the russians started to communicate we won the match easily, the dude never said a single bad word about them. If you guys always complain and put the blame on the russians, of course they will perform super bad, they get frustrated every match and no one is willing to give them a chance. This way they will never improve. It's not only the russians, this whole rage, toxic thing applies to everyone. Some people screams/mock them because they can't speak english. For fuck sake people, give them a fucking chance because they're trying at least. This will only destroy their confident and they will never try to talk in english again.Summary:
Summarize: I think if you want to do it, you've done your research, you've wanted the same design forever, go for it. BUT - I would strongly advise against your placement. I have a half sleeve (upper arm) and even though I love it, it can sometimes be a pain in the arse covering it up for work and that's even with longish short sleeves. You're 19 - you have to assume that you'll have to wear long sleeves for the majority of your working career, and you'll be in trouble if you get a job with a uniform that calls for short sleeves. It also is less problematic if you DO love it less in the years to come than you do now. Furthermore, it may be seen as a bit of a compromise family-wise if it's more easily coverable.Summary:
Summarize: I think the thing that bugs people the most though is the Brand will be profiting off of his rather worthless commentary (But he's giving the money to charity! Yeah I'm sure he gets absolutely no slice of this whatsoever). The issue is a lot of the solutions people offer to the "Income Gap" just kind of pass the bill along. Not all, but a lot of stuff I see seems to imply that the wealthy need to pick up the bill for everyone. This is imposed through higher taxes on the wealthy (dont see how this will solve shit, now bureaucrats will just have more funds to sling around) and a gov't mandated higher minimum wage which would just cause expenses to go up and a handful of people to lose jobs while the other 80% have marginally better paying gigs. Personally, I'm pretty fiscally conservative, I think it's what makes America great, having the freedom to choose what gets done with our money as opposed to having the government (that hardly any of us trust) choose what to do with it. But I would be all for more available education to low-income families. I'm aware there's already a good amount of funding out there for those in need, and I don't think throwing money at this is necessarily the answer to the problem. But as someone who would be flipping burgers if it were not for my education I think it's an opportunity we should try to give to every american citizen. Fuck raising the minimum wage, fuck only increasing taxes on the wealthy, lets just equip our citizens to give back more to the economy and country. /rant sorry if this looks like it's directed at you /u/truwhtthugSummary:

Summarize: Story time! So a little backstory; I had boxed at an amateur level for roughly four years at the time of this happening, this included competing at a national level so to say I was quite skilled in the pugilistic arts would be accurate. Edit: decided to add more about me and the guy Me: 4 years of boxing at the time. 160lbs 5'10, don't know about body fat or anything but I always had a six pack so I wasn't fat. Him: don't think he had any experience in combat sports or martial arts or what have you, but he played rugby and probably outweighed me by about 30lbs at the minimum with a typical rugby player body I.e. Very thick and dense but a bit on the soft bellied side, probably an inch or two taller than me. So i was at a house party which included about 30% I already knew and the rest being made up of friends of friends, everyone was having a good time. I was stood outside the house with a group of about 5/6 guys including myself, and as guys often do when having drinks there was some friendly back and forth, banter if you will, and it would seem one fella couldn't take a joke. I don't remember specifically what it was he had said but I remember that I replied with 'nah shut the fuck up' which got a few laughs from the other guys in the group, I was stood with the guy I replied to to my right about two feet away, and out of the corner of my vision I saw he take a swing at me catching me in the mouth. I instinctively shifted my right foot back and dropped my bottle going into my boxing stance, he threw another sloppy haymaker which I rolled (ducked) under, I started throwing back straight shots in combinations, just simple stuff double jab-right straight-leading to a lead hook basic shit, and by doing this I quickly drove him back to the wall of the house. This was basically my tactic for actual matches; drive them back to the ropes and work the body and head, and this is what happened then I only threw a couple of big shots before my friends pulled me away but as soon as I stopped hitting him the dude started talking shit again which I'll admit was very annoying. We left soon after and I heard from one of my friends who was on a rugby team with this guy that when he saw him a couple of days later he still had a bruised face and split lip, the worst injury I gained from this encounter was a minor welt on the inside of my lip were it hit my teeth mid sentence, along with some sore hands.Summary:

Pretty much all of the engineers I've met at U of I are just so arrogant about it, and no offense, but you guys (as in the r/uiuc community) kinda come off that way too. It's like people who aren't engineers are just worthless. I know we're a great engineering school and all, but face it, the whole world can't be engineers. 1)We would die out because nobody would be getting laid and 2)There are more roles to be filled in society than engineering ones.

Summarize: Two of my friends and I were playing Smash Brothers in one of our basements in high school, while his mother hosted a book club meeting upstairs. A few of the book club members had brought their children, who had found their way into the basement and were playing ping-pong nearby. One of my friends had something awful befall him in the game, which happened fairly often as he was awful at it, and yelled out, "GOD-FUCKING DAMMIT!!" He then looked over at the children playing ping-pong, who were all under the age of ten, and said, "I mean...SHUCKS DARNSY!"Summary:

Summarize: OP is basically saying "you aren't playing my way, so you're playing it wrong". If people find something a grind, then they find it a grind; no amount of saying "but it's not" will change their mind. I don't enjoy being gated (by AR) from doing higher level fractals, but if I want to progress I'm required to grind out infusions/gold/craft Ascended to do it. Ascended has an impact on LARGE parts of the community: WvW, PvE, and Fractals. PvE is probably the LEAST impacted, as it's solely a stat boost there(whoopdeedo on clearing a dungeon in 20 less seconds). Fractals has a HUGE impact due to AR; the rest falls into PvE zone. WvW...potentially has an impact based upon meta, group comp, and number of people in Ascended; lots of factors at play there, but it definitely shouldn't be ignored. Either way, I understand the frustration and at times feel it myself. When you're a straight Fractal player or WvW'er and you see the requirement of Ascended...it can be daunting to have to farm all that shit(lets be honest: Fractal/WvW rewards are/were shit compared to general PvE); whereas if you've been PvEing since launch and farming Champ/Scarlet/Orr/etc, then you're not worrying the least.Summary:
Summarize: Kind of not so funny story: I had to get a physical in high school to do sports, so I went to the big one we held once a year at the gym, where the majority of students went to get their physical. Basically they ask you a bunch of questions, pinch your skin, make you lie down, blah blah. Well, I was a skinny lass, so as I lay down on a hard counter so the lady could do I'm-not-sure-what by pressing on my abdomen, she frowned. She pushed deeper and deeper and asked me if I was constipated in front of a bunch of pretty blonde volleyball players without pants or shorts because they were in line for a nearby station. I told her no, so she asked more questions about my shitting and urinary schedules. She told me I had a hard ball inside. By this point, I'm burning red: I had never done sports before, but here I was trying to get cleared to do swim and water polo in front of these popular girls judging me as I talked about poop. The lady then told me to see a doctor to check out what was going on. We emailed my doctor, and she asked what side the ball was on. Well, it's on my lower left! And she replies that it's my back and that it's completely normal, I was just very skinny. (The reason she could feel my back from the left side of my body is because at the time I had moderately-severe scoliosis, but because to everybody's surprise it didn't affect my hips and shoulders too much, no one could tell unless I bent over.)Summary:

I don't care who you are, because it's up to the community (us..., everyone) to make sure we are all accountable for our actions. This won't reach everyone playing the game, obviously, and it sure as hell won't change the AF who are inherently dickbags. However, I think it's important to at least make commentary on what is currently happening. I'm a frequent invader at P.S. I love this area. I only love this area because it is fair (i.e., I won't fight by myself) most of the time. So yeah, I'm a bit of a chicken shit as it is and refuse to throw myself into 3v1 if I can help it. I think most invaders, unless you're a GOD, will do something similar. What I have noticed though, over my past few days of acquiring 100 embers through PvP, along with plenty of those sweeeeeet mouth muscles, is that AF are shitbags. Really. I should also note that out of all of those invasions, maybe 1/10 of them have included a red attacking me. However, at least 5/10 (halfies) have been AF having a hard-on for attacking anyone that isn't them. The only logical response from those of us being the recipient invaders is, well, what the fuck? You're right. I did invade in this area. Technically the AF are supposed to fuck up anyone that comes here. Okay. What I feel absolutely obligated to ask though, is why attack the reds, or purple danks, or the orange SunnyD's? I say this out of realism. We all know what realism is: rational, power -based priorities. I can tell you right now that the AF have a complete disconnect on the reality of DS. I am not here to fuck you up-- I am here to fight the Host. That sexy HoE that has a little bit of fire that I want to snuff out. We both do. Stop fucking with me if we're not necessarily on the same team, but have the same goal. Seriously.Summary:
Summarize: remember those signs in Blockbuster and other video stores? "Please be kind, rewind." or something like that. When DVD's came out, it was like a gift from the God's. No more rewinding!

Summarize: First, you do realize that you are the one slandering him and he kept his views on your racism private and just banned you and only mentioned it in mod mail when you asked why he banned you, right? Do you feel a tad hypocritical. This guys an ass, but he just banned you, you've obsessively stalked him. Second, I can't read the post since you didn't link to it, but the title does sound racist. Why mention that someone of African descent attacked the girl? Why not just say a girl was attacked for wearing a crucifix? Does it actually matter that it was by someone of "African descent?" Also, do you realize that "African descent" is almost always not the right way to refer to a black person unless you're referring to someone who literally migrated from Africa in their lifetime and are acting in a way informed by that? Giving you the benefit of the doubt I'd imagine it's just a misstep, but realize that specifically calling out race is race-bating a bit when it has nothing to do with it. Why not call out the other kids religion? This is like saying the girl was attacked by someone of Irish descent...unless it's a protestant/Catholic English/Irish related attack it serves no fucking purpose. You should ask yourself why you'd mention someone of African descent and not if they were of Irish descent.Summary:
Summarize: We had a strange girl in our 6th grade (12 year old kids) gym class. She was very popular and outgoing, but she was always getting into some kind of trouble (sent away to boot-camp for misbehaving kids, proudly came back to school in an orange jumpsuit.) Anyway, out of nowhere she strips to her training bra and panties and starts humping a bench and says how awesome sex is, and her new boyfriend had sex with her in the butt the other day. The following week, she came to gym class, we all got changed, she stripped to her bra and panties again and started doing a stripper dance... she had CARVED her boyfriend's name into her skin (both legs) with a knife. I've seen a variety of self inflicted wounds and self-injury... but this was CARVED, as in 'she's going to still have these scars when we're 80 years old and in a nursing home' carved. I was like WTF, and all the other girls tried to ignore it, her friends thought it was cool because it reminded them of tattoos. I found out later that day that her new boyfriend was 22, and even though all the other kids thought that was extremely cool, I was beyond horrified. I didn't really think to tell an adult though, because the girl was ridiculously violent and I had no doubt in my mind she would either send kids to jump me or she would bring a knife to school and hurt me herself. She went missing two years later, and I recently found her on facebook. She had a kid around that time. The dad is mysteriously not in the picture, and she insists that he died/ran off/joined the army/moved to Canada... the story always changes. That's more sad than anything though...Summary:
Summarize: If you want to be happy for the rest of your life never make a pretty woman your wife. So from my personal point of view get an ugly girl to marry you.Summary:
Summarize: It was kind of a bittersweet meet up honestly. Definitely not anything special or at all what we had discussed, but not exactly a disaster either. I'm not sure how to tell this story so I'm just going to start... My birthday is this month and he had been discussing what he wanted to do for/to me. How he wanted to just make the day all about my pleasure, sort of like the first time we slept together. He told me he got massage oil and and had been telling me he couldn't wait to get his hands on me, to tease me, and to taste me. That he wouldn't let me have his cock until I came for him. On his lips. That plan definitely went out the window. When I walked in he wrapped his arms around me and kissed me. My lips, my ears, my neck, and I was doing the same. Before I knew it he picked me up, my legs were wrapped around him, and he carried me to the desk. My dress was up around my hips and I could feel how hard he was through my thin tights. He pulled each of my legs up to his chest, running his hands the entire length, to remove my shoes as I laid back. I thought he was going to take me right there but we made it to the bed. We barely made it to the bed. He was pulling my tights off and on top of me in seconds. He left my panties on to tease me, letting me feel his hard cock against me. I reached down an pushed my panties aside and with one firm thrust I had all of him. That first moment always feels amazing. I feel so full, so tight around him. He fucked me like that, half of our clothes still on, moaning into my ear and neck, until he came. We relaxed still wrapped up in each other before finally stripping off the rest of our sweaty clothes and having a drink. We had somehow knocked the box of chocolates off the bed and wasted half of them. He laughed about how I ruined his plan and I told him there was still time. As we were talking and laughing and grazing what was left of the candy we we ended up discussing his wife and how jealous she is of one of their single neighbors and an invasion of his privacy that she did recently. I didn't know what to say and half hoped he wasn't making it up because of our communication talk recently (which we came to an agreement on anyway) and half hoped he was because it was a little crazy. Despite that awkward moment he soon had his hands on me again. I was the little spoon and he was caressing my body. Running his fingertips down my side, over my ass, gently kissing the back of my neck and nibbling my shoulder, until his fingers found their way between my thighs. He growled into my ear, mmm, as he does, "you're so wet for me" and I moved my ass against him so he could get inside me. I responded with a soft moan and told him I wanted him. He kept massaging my clit with his figers, his other hand across my chest holding me close, as he slowly but firmly pushed himself into me over and over, sending little waves of pleasure throughout my body. I could hear his breath quicken, even over my own noises, feel it against my neck. I was pushing back against him, my legs trembling, mumbling incoherent "yes"s between moans as he kept his pace. The perfect pace. As I started to cum he forced himself as deep as he could get and held his cock there, his fingers making just the right movements to take me over the edge, the arm over my chest held me tightly as I shook. After enjoying that for a few moments I rolled back against him, throwing a leg on each side, without losing his cock I was riding him backwards. This always makes me laugh a little because it reminds me of the "crab walk" game in elementary school. So, as I can't believe that is sexy, I sat up into reverse cowgirl. He loves looking at my ass and squeezing it and seeing me take him in. After what I believed was a good workout I hopped off and wrapped my mouth around him. I sucked all of my juices off of him. But I could only go so long wothout it and I started riding him again, leaning over to nibble his ears. The way he was grabbing me, the almost grunts I could hear, I knew he wanted it harder so I gave it to him, but before long he had me on my back again, with a pillow underneath me and my legs over his shoulders. He knows I love this, the slow deep thrusts and the way it makes his pelvis rub against my clit. It wasn't long befire my knees were buckling again and he started riding me hard, pushing my body towards the edge of the bed. By the time we finished my head and shoulders were hanging off. We didn't notice this but the clock in the room was an hour ahead so we didn't think we had much time afterward. We layed there relaxing and laughing and snuggling until he got into the shower. I watched him get dressed longingly and he came back to bed. It is always so hard for either of us to leave, and he started teasing me again. He was kissing my neck, which drives me crazy, and I alid his hand between my legs to show him exactly how crazy. Once he felt how badly I wanted him he started using thise fingers. Moaning and writhing he asked "can I make you cum like this?". I had to be honest. The answer was no. No one can, I barely can make it work myself. So he left me like that! All worked up wth no release. . . . . .Summary:
Summarize: The word "neckbeard" is not nearly as offensive as "slut" or "cunt", and by no means is "fattie" used to discriminate mainly against males. See [this thread]( for some lovely examples. At the time of posting, [this comment]( has 963 points. Obviously I agree with the principles of gender equality, but to suggest that men face the same issues as women online is entirely ridiculous. For example, every time a woman posts a picture of something where she just so happens to appear in the picture , that ridiculous image of "men vs women posting a photo of something" is inevitably the top comment.

Summarize: Ok first off, yes I know they are stinky as Shit lol I'm just wondering. I have smoked one in a basement before but it was already filled up with smoke so I couldn't really tell how bad the blunt smelled. I live with my parents who are cool with me smoking, but I don't want the smell to leave the room- is that possible? Also it's not like I have to do it in my room, but if it's possible that would be a good thing to know. I've smoked with a gravity bong in my room before no problem. Also, does the tobacco make a difference in smell? Because the bathroom is kinda the designated smoke spot but if it smells worse I don't want to fuck it up. I guess that's it,Summary:
Summarize: You can farm it in normal by scouting the easily accessable goblin spawn areas (Caverns of Araneae, Northern Highlands, and Core of Arreat), faster with a group. The money from the Vault is great at T6, but you'll make more money in the long run if you just get the gem sooner. Staggering your bonus armor form gold isn't particularly necessary IMO. If you have a proper build, frequent kills will keep be more than enough to keep your armor up while allowing you to tank through arcane sentries and molten explosions or anything dangerous.Summary:
Summarize: Funny.. But I'm against the whole, 'throw the ball back' thing. I have season tickets to my team, one of the reasons being, I want a damn ball. I don't care who it comes from, I want one. It's a bucket list item of mine to catch a home run/foul/whatever. So I put myself in a position to have the most chances to catch one. You can boo me all you want, I'm keeping the ball even if it is a home run from the opposing team. Take for instance, last years world series. Pujols hits a record setting home run at the Ballpark in Arlington. The girl who ended up with it, under pressure, threw it back. Fuck that. That was a history making ball. Not to mention it was worth tens of thousands. You would have to kill me to take it away, I sure as hell ain't throwing it away.Summary:
Summarize: EMT here, If you're in a car crash, you shouldn't be getting out of your seat unless the car is going to explode.

Summarize: My father was returning from a deaf men's conference, and offered to let two guys stay at our house instead of having to sleep at the airport. Now, some deaf people have a tendency to either not be aware of how much noise they're making (breathing, burping, slurping) or perhaps they don't mind it. So I'm in my room on the computer while my girlfriend does some homework on the bed behind me. My room has one door to the hallway, and one to the restroom. The hallway has a door to the restroom, the guestroom and my room. My room is usually very hot due to the heat vent, my computer, the tv, and my xbox all being on at the same time. To help alleviate the heat, we leave the restroom door open as it is quite cool in there. One of the deaf men, who happens to be quite loud, enters the restroom through the hallway, breathing and grunting, and proceeds to sit onto the toilet and begin the duty. He fore goes closing the door to my room. So he's grunting and moaning and snorting while water is splashing and the air is stinking. My girlfriend is busting her ass laughing, still attempting to stifle her cackles although it matters not. To add to this, my father had just put our chihuahua in my room as she was bothering the guests. So the dog jumps out of my lap when the action begins, and starts her habitual licking on the immobile deaf man. So we begin to hear angry groans akin to a zombie in a b-movie horror film. I try calling my dog back but she would only return to the doorframe before running back to the man, and I refused to walk into sight of the deaf man. Eventually, I get the dog back and the man finishes his shit after about 10 minutes. He gets up and wipes his ass furiously and audibly. He walks over to the sink and begins washing his hands, but as he reaches for the towel he knocks my girlfriends electric toothbrush off the counter, turning it on as it lands onto the tile. My girlfriend had never stopped laughing but it had calmed to a dull giggle, but this gave her newfound energy returning her to absolute boisterous laughter. He never came into view. Just his arm from behind the wall, grabbing the toothbrush with a exasperated sigh followed with a definitive slam of the brush into the counter.Summary:
Summarize: Wrong in so many ways. Mobile? That's a joke. The only mobile gaming that's worth a damn is the DS, simply because of the amazing games. Smartphones will never be considered mobile gaming, if you consider playing tetris or simple planes while pooping or while you're waiting for something then that's not gaming. Consoles can survive if Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo give the people what they want ie a device with the capabilities of a PC. If those companies implement steam, or something similar it could survive off that basis alone. However, if they let users do what they want it would be even better. Why put security tags and ban people for trying to modify your product? If someone can make you're product better without ruining games for others, then you're a fool. Banning and voiding warranties because someone wants more memory, or someone wants better graphics is redundant. It serves one purpose; saves the company money. They don't have to do anything if they know you voided the warranty.Summary:
Summarize: My [now ex]girlfriend I was dating (for about a year and a half) would tell her dad about us having sex. One night while we were eating dinner with her family, someone said something along the lines of being exhausted from work. She then blurts out word for word "Yeah, I couldn't even move this morning cause Zach (me) was really rough with me last night"...Her dad pulled me aside later on and told me he was going to blow my fucking head off if he found out about us screwing again.

Summarize: He is nominally a bail bondsman in the loosest sense that he has a license. He is also an idiot who is lucky that he is on an island in the middle of the Pacific which makes it harder for people to leave to even go to another Hawaiian island. It also depends on the state law as to who and how you are allowed to recapture fugitives. I call him an idiot because while he many nominally have the right to do it how he does, he does it in a stupid way and opens himself up to a big chance of civil and possibly criminal liability. [He was once charged for illegally arresting someone in Mexico]( Even a half way decent bail bondsman or bounty hunter would check and even alert law enforcement if they were arresting someone outside of their state. Plus they would know that it is illegal in almost every country in the world to make such an arrest. Even several states, Oregon for one, don't allow a bondsman to pick up a skip or they consider it kidnapping. This even includes driving to the state, the skip getting into the car willingly, then driving back to where the bond was issued. Other states don's allow extradition to certain states, but also don't allow you to pick them up like in Oregon. The bounty hunting law that most bounty hunters and bail bondsmen use for their justification is a [Supreme Court case from 1872]( You don't want to be doing things relying on a case that is over 100 years old as your only safety margin. The bail bondsman or bounty hunter (depending on whether or not the state allows bounty hunters) has a limited time to bring the person into custody in the jurisdiction where the bond was set. The bondsman typically doesn't actually pay the money to the court, at least in my experience, until after this time has elapsed. As to the bounty hunter, typically the award is the fee that the bondsman was paid for the bond, which on average is 10% of the face amount of the bond ($100,000 bond would pay $10,000 fee). This means that while the bondsman may not make any money, he doesn't lose money either. Now, most states, but not all, allow and almost encourage the use of surety companies which are just insurance companies. What happens here is that if the person skips and is not brought in to court in time, the county/state (I haven't had experience with federal because the rules tend to be much stricter and defaults can occur even if the person goes to court) goes to the insurance company. Then the insurance company gets seeks indemnity from the bondsman. The bondsman then seeks indemnity from the co-signor and/or bonded person. One of the ways that these insurance companies protect themselves is require a substantial deposit by the bondsman before allowing them to write, a pledging of assets with a security agreement, to write. They also typically charge somewhere between 3-10% of the fee charged to be placed in a build up fund. This fund is controlled by the insurer, and is used to pay for forfeitures if they occur. Now some bonds are far better than others, so it depends on the specific case. Sometimes the person has money and/or property and the bondsman can be reimbursed. Many times however, the person is getting a bail bondsman rather than paying the fee itself because they can't afford to pledge the full face value of the bond. Again, this applies to my experience, I am not sure if some states don't allow personal bonding and require the use of a bondsman. So your odds of getting the money back are fairly slim. Before, sometimes the bondsman could negotiate a reduction in the amount owed if the person failed to go to court. Lately though with all the budget problems, this is not happening at all and the courts are requiring full face value reimbursement. In my state, what happens when a forfeiture is paid, the prosecutors office gets 25%, the municipality that made the arrest gets, the county gets 25%, and the state gets 25%. It can change depending on the exact crime and type, but for the most part this is a good rule of thumb. Therefore, they have an incentive to get as much as possible. So basically, your bail bondsman is more of a risk assessor and insurance agent than someone who goes and hunts down people. Hope this answers your questions, but if not, please feel to ask me any more you have or need clarification on any points.Summary:
Summarize: Well, since everyone here hates this guy, might as well help you guys deal with him. First off, there are very few heroes that can deal with OD in a 1v1 lane. A competently played LD and Razor are the only ones who can really win the lane without drawbacks. If you want to pick Huskar, be prepared to have your ass kicked if you don't completely and utterly obliterate OD in lane AND not let him bounce back up, since you have one of the worst INT stats in the game. Also, your passive won't help you when you are on 100% HP, and the orbs are pure damage. That's why you don't 1v1 him. You call friends. You are dealing with a hero which is quite literally made out of glass. Seriously, Minecraft lied to you, obsidian is glorified glass. He has nothing to help him escape other than Astral Imprisonment, and if he is hugging the tower, he isn't stealing your INT. Shutting him down in the laning stage is, quite frankly, key if you want to have a good chance of him not knocking at your T3 20 minutes in. Still, not all is lost if you lose the lane. If you can stop OD from capitalizing on the advantage he got, either by winning other lanes, or gong full on rat doto, he'll fall off quite quickly. If you can get a BKB(which you really should, all things considered), you are on your way up, if they don't have any other proper carries. You can also try ganking him, but it will be a bit harder. Pretty much every item he gets in the mid game helps him get away from your 5 man gank squad, so keep that in mind. At the end of the laning stage, expect at least a force staff or a mekanism. A thing a bit less obvious is the skill build. A lot of ODs will take the first level in their ultis quite late at level 10 or a bit earlier. However, do not be surprised by an ult at six, as an early kill is far more useful to OD than to most other heroes. Also, do not underestimate the stun component of Astral Imprisonment: 4 seconds of not being able to do anything is a lot of time for his team to move in and secure a kill. A force staff-imprisonment combo can be deadly, but you can also bait it out and force a teamfight on your terms by some clever maneuvering. Now, let's say you just managed to give OD a bad start, and he is now farming to try and get back into the game. Expect him to quickly push out a lane with his orb, and then run away elsewhere. He will do this because it is far too bad of an idea for him to help a push by himself and try to get gold, not only because of his escape, but also because his tower damage is horrible, to put it lightly. Also, his squishyness and lack of AOE pretty much blocks him from dedicated jungling. If you want to stop this, keep an eye on the creep equilibrium, and try to gank him from behind when he comes to farm a creep wave approaching his tower.Summary:
Summarize: My friend and I took his parents' boat out when we were younger. We had a video camera and were video taping each other doing flips and stuff off the boat in the lake. We made the dumb mistake of both being in the water, talking, not paying attention, with pretty strong wind, and no anchor down. When we realized the boat was drifting (we were treading water 18ft deep with no vests), the boat was only about 20 yards away but drifting fast with 2ft waves posing it from us. We started swimming like mad to catch up. We both got pretty tired and I had a moment of panic like "oh shit, we could both very well drown out here." Fortunately, we made it to a sandbar, and the boat had slowed, so we were able to walk shoulder-deep to the boat, where we lay panting for a few minutes before swearing never to do something as stupid again.Summary:
Summarize: You know the sexual so I will give an example of emotional. There is a girl I know, who I am actually talking to on facebook right now, I am attracted to her more emotionally than sexually. She is cute, kind of nerdy, and generally a hipster. I think most people would consider her like a 6-7 on the usual hot scale, but most people don't know her. We talk about books, music, and theater most of the time. She has the little, hard to describe, habits that some girls have that are quirky and adorable. I want to be with her and spend time with her for the conversations we have, and the goofy shenanigans we get up to.Summary:

Summarize: I changed a classmate's final grade in high school. Back in the early eighties... My friend was a computer whiz and I was a break-in expert (never to steal stuff, just to hang out in the school or such). These were old terminals that you sat at and printed out, no monitors. There was one in the guidance office and I noticed they left it on all the time when I was in there about a grade problem. I had my friend write a small program that would create a prompt and then capture whatever was typed in, send it to a dummy account, and log out. I thought the Guidance counselor would type the password at the prompt to log in, this would send it to our account, and he would just think it didn't work and try it again, logging in successfully. After school the computer lab of terminals was open late so you could work on them. We set up our dummy account. I snuck down the hall into the guidance office, opened the door with my trusty break-in wire, palms sweaty... set the trap, sneak out. The overnight wait was a long one, we had to survive a whole day of school and wait until it was after hours to access the terminals privately. THE PASSWORD WAS THERE!... jumping around the room high fiving and such. I had already decided that we would try to change a grade slightly of someone who would never suspect us, I chose a girl that I knew, and changed her B to a B+. We left and waited a long wait overnight again. We swore that we would not tell anyone so we would not get expelled or worse. The next day it was Defcon 5 when we arrived at school. People were running in and out of the main computer room with serious and scary faces on. I asked someone what was going on and I felt like I had an "I did it" tattoo on my forehead. My friend and I tried to talk calmly when we could but we decided it was too hot. We decided that if they somehow tracked one of us to it and called us into the principal's office, that person would try to say they did it all them selves to save the other. They never caught us.Summary:
Summarize: Hi, I'm a 27 year old software engineer in Boston. I have had a whole host of issues after breaking up with my old girlfriend, and I was wondering if you guys could give me some advice. We had an excellent relationship for most of the 3 years, and we were talking about maybe getting married and plans like that. We both had stable jobs, and things were looking pretty good. Then, driving to my apartment one day from work, I was smashed by a truck running a red light (or so I'm told). I don't actually remember it, it is just sort of a gap in my memory. I suddenly came to 2 days later in a hospital bed, where I learned I had broken 17 bones and would not be able to leave the hospital for months. My girlfriend never came and visited me even once during the 5 months I was there, and I even had some family members call her phone, but she seemingly had just vanished. I was heartbroken. But after returning home, I found expensive equipment missing from my apartment: my TV, laptop, iPad, and other items. I was confused and I spent a while tracking her dad's cellphone number down in phone books. When I called him, she answered and cursed me out for "leaving" her after I got in the crash. Apparently she thinks I abandoned her by being confined to a hospital bed for months. She told me she smashed all my expensive shit in a rage. Is there anything I can do about this? Any legal options, settlements, etc? My life was already thrown off course by a mile after the crash, and I want to start rebuilding, but this business with my ex has put me down a bit.Summary:
Summarize: So Friday my buddy had about 2 grams of some decently dank stuff so he left it to me to make firecrackers with some of it and he'd roll the rest. I used graham crackers, cookie butter (tastes just like cookies holy moly) and a little olive oil. Fast forward about 7pm, the firecrackers are made, the joint is rolled, we are on our bikes riding down the nature trail behind his house. We stop at a spot, fish a little bit and decide to start the sesh. We eat our firecrackers, and light up. We keep riding down the trail and while walking our bikes up this huge ass hill it's starting to hit my buddy, I don't feel it yet. So we decide to turn around and head back home, but his chain comes off his bike, he's like whatever. We get on our bikes, forgetting the huge ass hill and next thing you know we are bombing this bitch. I hear him ahead of me saying to the people that had just started walking the trail, "Watch out, I have no brakes... OH FUCK, I'm going too fast!" He speeds past these people and I follow and eventually we make our way back home. While walking, we encounter this big ass dog in the street barking at us with no collar. I stare it down. I felt a connection with the dog. The dog had a connection with me. I told it to stop and go home and it left! Wow. So now we go to our neighbor's house (about 9pm) and hang out. She's having a party Sunday (today) and she needed help setting up. We get there and I am starting to feel it.. my friend is already baked and I know I'm about to get hit hard, too. We move some stuff and sit on the couch and our neighbor comes over with some company and they start cracking jokes. I hear them, but it doesn't feel real. That joke wasn't funny, why am I laughing? Bro, you feel this shit? After what felt like forever laughing at these adults they leave, but one guy lags behind and comes over to us. We are putting pillow cases on couch pillows at the moment. "What's up?" "Nothing." "Yall drink?" "Nah, not really." "Yall smoke?" My friend and I make eye contact and know we have to say no. "No." "Bullshit. come on now. I got the bong" "We don't have any weed." "I do, let's go fire up." My friend looks uncomfortable so I speak up fast and tell him no, but thanks for the offer. He tells us to think about it and we say ok. "Dude, we have to leave, he is the devil!" "He has weed!!" "No, we are already high as shit!" "So?" I convince him that we can't and he understands. Meanwhile, we figure out that we are too high to put the pillows in the cases and we just sit back down. After about 10 minutes we try again and this time all 4 pillows have their cases. (about 11pm) We decide to go somewhere else in the house and we relocate to the living room where Batman is on, the one with Bane. So we sit down and we are stoned out of our minds and my friend lays down, but I am watching Batman. I'm so into Batman and as stuff happens in the movie I narrate what happens as I type it into my phone. Next thing you know, our neighbor says she needs more help. My friend looks at me and closes his eye back. Shit.. I have to help her.. I make myself back to her and see what she needs. I don't even remember what it was, but I did it.. I sit back down and she needs more help. I go help. She then takes me to her room and is saying something and I'm trying to follow and she gets a 50 out of her purse. "I can't take this." "Why not?" "We barely did anything." "You guys helped a lot and I appreciate it so here." "You sure?" Then she punches me in the chest and says "Take the fucking money." The hit is pulsating through my whole body. I thank her and cooperate and head back to finish watching Batman. It's over. I grab the foam board (I needed for a project) I managed to cut precise as shit sometime earlier while high, and we head home. (12:41am why do I remember that?) We walk across the street and reality still feels like a dream. I'm at a solid 8 (I suppose the higher you get, you start to adjust your scale, right?) and we are hungry. We cut up some chicken, I'm giving my friend directions while still high, we add some taco seasoning sauce stuff and I'm trying to lay down on everything in sight.. The counter, the table, the sink.. I'm done.. The tacos are finished and I add a bunch of seasonings. I raid their pantry and my friend is just looking at my like I'm crazy. I eat. I drink water, we head to his room. He has a decent sized bed so I sit on one end and lay down and he's on the other end. I eventually fall asleep listening to some Samurai Champloo.. Next morning I wake up. "Yo, did this shit and that shit and xyz happen?" "Yeah." I check my pocket for the 50. Holy Balls, it was real! I'm at about a 3 and things are warped, but I had control.. I cruised down to sobriety about 1pm. Jeez. Next time I get that high I'm freeing up the whole weekend lol. But I'm glad I still had decent control while I was that high. I could process things, I kept paranoia away, but I had to pay attention. I'm especially glad I could turn down a bad guy trying to push more drugs and alcohol on us.Summary:
Summarize: It was kind of a bittersweet meet up honestly. Definitely not anything special or at all what we had discussed, but not exactly a disaster either. I'm not sure how to tell this story so I'm just going to start... My birthday is this month and he had been discussing what he wanted to do for/to me. How he wanted to just make the day all about my pleasure, sort of like the first time we slept together. He told me he got massage oil and and had been telling me he couldn't wait to get his hands on me, to tease me, and to taste me. That he wouldn't let me have his cock until I came for him. On his lips. That plan definitely went out the window. When I walked in he wrapped his arms around me and kissed me. My lips, my ears, my neck, and I was doing the same. Before I knew it he picked me up, my legs were wrapped around him, and he carried me to the desk. My dress was up around my hips and I could feel how hard he was through my thin tights. He pulled each of my legs up to his chest, running his hands the entire length, to remove my shoes as I laid back. I thought he was going to take me right there but we made it to the bed. We barely made it to the bed. He was pulling my tights off and on top of me in seconds. He left my panties on to tease me, letting me feel his hard cock against me. I reached down an pushed my panties aside and with one firm thrust I had all of him. That first moment always feels amazing. I feel so full, so tight around him. He fucked me like that, half of our clothes still on, moaning into my ear and neck, until he came. We relaxed still wrapped up in each other before finally stripping off the rest of our sweaty clothes and having a drink. We had somehow knocked the box of chocolates off the bed and wasted half of them. He laughed about how I ruined his plan and I told him there was still time. As we were talking and laughing and grazing what was left of the candy we we ended up discussing his wife and how jealous she is of one of their single neighbors and an invasion of his privacy that she did recently. I didn't know what to say and half hoped he wasn't making it up because of our communication talk recently (which we came to an agreement on anyway) and half hoped he was because it was a little crazy. Despite that awkward moment he soon had his hands on me again. I was the little spoon and he was caressing my body. Running his fingertips down my side, over my ass, gently kissing the back of my neck and nibbling my shoulder, until his fingers found their way between my thighs. He growled into my ear, mmm, as he does, "you're so wet for me" and I moved my ass against him so he could get inside me. I responded with a soft moan and told him I wanted him. He kept massaging my clit with his figers, his other hand across my chest holding me close, as he slowly but firmly pushed himself into me over and over, sending little waves of pleasure throughout my body. I could hear his breath quicken, even over my own noises, feel it against my neck. I was pushing back against him, my legs trembling, mumbling incoherent "yes"s between moans as he kept his pace. The perfect pace. As I started to cum he forced himself as deep as he could get and held his cock there, his fingers making just the right movements to take me over the edge, the arm over my chest held me tightly as I shook. After enjoying that for a few moments I rolled back against him, throwing a leg on each side, without losing his cock I was riding him backwards. This always makes me laugh a little because it reminds me of the "crab walk" game in elementary school. So, as I can't believe that is sexy, I sat up into reverse cowgirl. He loves looking at my ass and squeezing it and seeing me take him in. After what I believed was a good workout I hopped off and wrapped my mouth around him. I sucked all of my juices off of him. But I could only go so long wothout it and I started riding him again, leaning over to nibble his ears. The way he was grabbing me, the almost grunts I could hear, I knew he wanted it harder so I gave it to him, but before long he had me on my back again, with a pillow underneath me and my legs over his shoulders. He knows I love this, the slow deep thrusts and the way it makes his pelvis rub against my clit. It wasn't long befire my knees were buckling again and he started riding me hard, pushing my body towards the edge of the bed. By the time we finished my head and shoulders were hanging off. We didn't notice this but the clock in the room was an hour ahead so we didn't think we had much time afterward. We layed there relaxing and laughing and snuggling until he got into the shower. I watched him get dressed longingly and he came back to bed. It is always so hard for either of us to leave, and he started teasing me again. He was kissing my neck, which drives me crazy, and I alid his hand between my legs to show him exactly how crazy. Once he felt how badly I wanted him he started using thise fingers. Moaning and writhing he asked "can I make you cum like this?". I had to be honest. The answer was no. No one can, I barely can make it work myself. So he left me like that! All worked up wth no release. . . . . .Summary:
Summarize: Me & a couple friends found a dog wandering around the park; he has a chip but both phone numbers on it are disconnected. Consensus among the animal rescue pros we've asked is that the dog was neglected; big chunks of his ears are eaten off from some easily preventable insect condition called "flystrike." So they think whoever had him didn't give a shit and just let him go. He jumped the fence at my friend's place and got taken to the East Valley shelter; his owner has apparently not tried to track him down. Today's the day he gets put up for adoption. We spent a couple days with this dog and he just kicks unholy ass. Great with kids, great with other dogs, good on a leash, etc. etc. We'd take him if we had the space, but we don't. Maybe you do. Maybe a mournful Sarah McLachlan tune is being carried on the wind and you are realizing that your lifestyle with adequate yard space and energy to occasionally walk the beast and toss him a tennis ball is pretty much perfect except for the lurking hole in your heart. A German Shepherd shaped hole. MoreSummary:
Summarize: I rarely lucid dream and last night was the first time in a few months so I was pretty excited. Anyway, after becoming lucid and walking around touching things for a bit I decided to make a girl I had seen in a dream earlier that night appear in front of me so we could, ya know.. Anyway I was standing in front of a table and chairs and I had no idea how to just make her appear so I picked up a towel that was next to me and dangled it in front of my face, hoping she would appear after I took it away like a magic trick or something. Didn't work. I tried again but this time I closed my eyes, then when I tried to open them I opened my real eyes :( Shoulda just flown around or somethingSummary:
Summarize: the rear wheel of my bike was stolen earlier today. i have been leaving my bike at the bike racks i describe in the title lately. a buddy of mine told me (after the fact) that his bike was stolen from there. also, there is another bike there that's been stripped of its back wheel. i should have taken that as evidence of it being a shitty spot. the wheel: velocity dyad tandem rim shimano deore front hub with bolted cogSummary:
Summarize: Thanks for the replies, even though there wasnt that many, it was nice to see people wanting to help out. Again, sorry for the wall of text, a lot has happened over the holidays. Here's the original post about the situation: My sister and brother visited the family home over the holidays and in short, Christmas was a disaster. Petty arguments, pissing eachother off - tension was high. And my little sister was oblivious to the root of the problem, but managed through it as its a pretty normal dynamic in my family. To make matters worse, my mother royally fucked up by casually telling my sister IN A CAR JOURNEY HOME, that herself and my father are splitting up. My little sister just sat beside me on the couch and said gently; "mom told me about her and dad. I just find it hard to picture". She was in shock. I am sorry to say but I lost the plot and started shouting at my mother that she fucked up and we should have told Jenny as a family, and that nothing should have been said until concrete arrangements had been made, because the house is chaotic. She just screamed back that Jenny is her daughter and I shouldn't tell her how to parent her own child. I couldn't argue with her and I was too angry. Eventually, through the advice of my older sister (who I showed this thread), my mother is moving out to a house just down the road from our family home. Literally a 2 minute walk. I don't know how this will work out. Obviously it'll be good not to have her and my dad around eachother and arguing, but I just have a feeling she will come back to the house all the time for supplies and "her stuff". She has also stated that Jenny will be spending one week at "hers" and one week at the family home with my dad. I personally feel this is too much too soon and that they should get a proper mediator to sort this out, but they won't listen. This is such a crappy update but basically stuff has happened but it's not resolved yet. I have hope but I know it's not going to be easy. Having your parents constantly crying and bringing up the broken remains of the relationship isn't nice but I'm glad I can be there for Jenny.Summary:
Summarize: So since the first day I met my roommate, I knew my roommate and I would have many a heated debate, because he was in the ROTC and was as conservative-minded as one might expect to find in Oklahoma, and I'm a super liberal homosexual. He has said things in the past that made me think it was not the best idea to come out to him, but nothing too bad just the common articulation that he thinks gays shouldn't have the same rights to marriage as straight people. Recently he had to do ALLY training at our college, which is like a certification that you are not a homophobe and if you need to talk you're there to listen. he told me that at the end, he didn't want to be certified because he thought it would look like he "supported the homosexual lifestyle", so I had pretty much decided to just not tell him and then never see him again after this semester. Last night, we both got in about 4:30 in the morning and were laying in our bunk bed talking about all sorts of random shit, and then somehow we got onto the topic politics (as per usual) and then more specifically his position on homosexuality. I don't know what made me think that this was a great time particularly for me to tell him, but I think it was because i sensed he didn't mean gay people any harm, like some do around here, he was just raised in rural USA with strong Mormon beliefs. I said something along the lines of "I know this might sound a little crazy but I'm gay, man" to which he replied, "I'm fine with that, i don't really care".Summary:
Summarize: Havel's isn't punished enough, agree. Wanting armour is not something you can bitch about, though. Generally this list is totally fair and I agree, but being annoyed by someone being tanky as they can be is just ridiculous. Also, I like how Havel's looks and I have the stats to use it with large weapons for that reason. Does that make me a bad player? Because I'm just playing the fashion souls, same as you. Yeah, I invade. But it's in the Crypt, and my aim is intimidation not getting kills. Full Havels with the Warlock Mask and a Red Eye ring is scary, especially when you just walk at people after doing the decapitate emote. 8)Summary:
Summarize: Hey there everyone :) My name is Maeve, I'm 17 and MTF. For the past 11 years, I've known I was trans, and the feelings have only grown stronger and stronger. I still live with my parents, but I'm getting to that point of suppressing my emotions that I'm starting to feel like I can't keep on living like this. My mom won't allow anything of any kind until I'm done with college in 4 years [including name changes, clothing, hormones, the whole bit] I just dont know what to do anymore. I've talked with her countless times but she just won't listen. Any and all advice would mean the world. Thank youSummary:
Summarize: Prelude Hi guys, I'm a support player, with party MMR currently at 4k. Dotabuff [here]( When I started playing, I realised how challenging and important the first 7 minutes are, in securing a solid early game. I break it down below, to give an idea of how a support (at my tier) is done in the typical pub. I can't really go into the specific HOWs (otherwise this post will get too long) Here goes: (Fountain) >I buy the wards and courier in pubs, since I'm often the only support. I buy tangoes. I pass 2 tangoes to the mid, and 1 ward to the offlaner. With my remaining, I buy branches/circlet/clarities/saveforsentries depending. I head to check if my pull camp is warded, and secure safelane bounty rune with my carry. Scouting is important because it gives you an idea if you need to rotate lanes, or which spots are possibly blocked. You don't want to waste sentries guessing wrong. 0:30 >0:30 I check the creep spawn to ensure my pull camp isn't blocked. If it is, I get sentries. I show my face on the bottom lane to zone the offlaner with some mana and HP, heading back to the pull camp by 0:53 to stack the camp. 1:13 >I pull the creep wave to the stacked camp, and co-ordinate with the carry to keep the creep wave momentum within the magic box just in front of the tower. If needed, I do a pull through to the other camp, or pull only half the creep wave, depending. From this, I should get a level, and enough gold to buy a TP from the side shop. 2:00 >I secure the 2 minute rune for mid, and see if he's doing well. If he needs a ward or spare regen I might need to ferry it out and babysit him a little. If I have another support with me, I might attempt a courier snipe. The 2:00 rune fight coincides with a good time for supports to pull their first gank on your offlaner/mid, so be prepared to TP. This is a good time to rotate to an aggro tri / dual lanes / dual mid if needed. 2:53 >Stack a big camp for your carry. Upgrade your courier at 3min mark. Go back to secure your carry's farm and control momentum. Pull at 3:43, stack a big camp at 3:53 again, and secure the 4min rune. 4:00 and onwards >Again, rune fight. Night time vision is a good time for ganking (or being ganked so make sure you carry that TP. Try to get your boots soon, if possible. A crawling support is no use to anyone. From this point on, you may need to roam accordingly, stack ancients, secure your own farm / levels in lane etc depending on the situation, and repeat the pulling, stacking, ganking until 7 minutes and beyond. Remember to get the next set of wards at 7:00. If you're snowballing hard or dying, spend your unreliable gold on TPs (drop them at fountain for your team). If your mid dies, buy him a TP so he doesn't fall behind too much. General Tips for supports Take timings. Big spell cooldowns, aegis expiry, ward expiry, smokes refreshing rate, etc. Just hold Alt + click on the clock to note a time. The carry needs to tunnel vision sometimes to ensure the last hits go well, and you need to watch the bigger picture. If you remember to stack at :53 every minute you have nothing to do, you'll be surprised at how rich your jungle becomes. Watch your map. TP reaction is important in protecting your cores. Most of the time the TP alone can scare them off. If you reach late and your core dies, it's still a free lane for precious XP and gold (spend it wisely, remember to get your cores a TP to get back to lane ASAP). Ward wisely. You only have so many wards. Depending on what your team needs, you may have to ward deep, defensive, in tricky spots, and other purposes, e.g. blocking enemy camps, behind towers. Your wards determine vision and how your team fares. If you're dumping them blindly in the same spot overlooking the rune from minute one to the moment your ancient explodes, go check out some good warding guides (or get a lobby with a support and ask them to show you the spots) Support meta items to help your carries may include value medallions, basi/mek-part auras, force staffs, glimmers, crests. These are useful on almost any support in protecting your carry. A late game Vlads for the %dmg helps too. Conclusion This is by no means a complete guide to anything. Do not follow the above guide blindly, they are considerations you should think about, but game situation dictates that not all of the above will apply. I just want those <4k MMR aspiring supports to get an idea of how hard this role is, and maybe for cores to appreciate a good support when they get one. Pulling, warding guides, and decision making are things that I don't cover in-depth here. I also don't cover battle positioning, dying for value, etc which a good support should know. It may also apply more selectively in 6.84, where it's much less of a 4 protect 1 strat. But until they phase out the support-carry meta totally, parts of this should always apply.Summary:
Summarize: Gave myself the gift of Battleship Galaxies for Christmas and played it tonight with my almost-12 yr old son. He picked up on it fairly quickly, even though he hasn't played that many wargames. He had some of the concepts (energy allocation especially) from playing Starfleet Command with me on the computer. The ships are quite nice, though I'm concerned that some of the finer details (antenna, guns) might break off with less than careful handling. One gripe is that the ship's stands slide a little too easily on the game board. I may try to find some sticky-backed rubber pads to combat accidental nudges... Adding and removing the shield/damage pegs to the ship's stand was challenging for my older fingers. My son had no such problems...the magic of youth! The ships and weapons systems for each side were different enough that it felt to me that we were actually playing different races that due to differences in technology, made different trade-offs in the design of their ships. The Wretch seem to have better shield tech, while the ISN compensated by having thicker hull armor. Overall, we had fun playing this game. It started slowly, but as we became familiar with the game mechanics our later turns went much faster. A nice touch was the inclusion of two cards with the sequence of events during a turn -- one for each side -- that was a handy reference of what to do next. He beat me just as we finished one pass through our decks.Summary:
Summarize: Recently I have been feeling bad about what seems like endless disasters and tragedies happening and me being too busy with my job to pitch in and help, so I've decided to devote my upcoming 9 vacation (Europe, read: holiday) days to providing my volunteer services to whatever community, agency, disaster, project, and/or people need me most. My strong skills are communication, management, technology (user level), and music. I'm not at all afraid to dive in and do some real labor, but my body isn't built to be as good at it as some people are. My vacation is the last week of January. I have enough money to travel anywhere and lodge and feed myself, but not much after that. Any ideas?Summary:
Summarize: I just received a new gtx 970 in the mail. After installing it in my PC it everything booted up just fine. I checked device manager and windows 7 recognized the 970. After I accepted Windows prompt to restart my PC to install updates the computer loaded up to the login screen-- which it showed for a couple of seconds at an incredibly blurry, low resolution, before black screening and showing a blinking white cursor in the top right corner. I updated my BIOS a week or so before (due to a different graphics card issue-- which is why I go a new card) so I don't believe that's the issue. I've tried taking the card and my hard drive out an putting it back in. Thanks for any help.Summary:
Summarize: While the changes also seem a bit excessive to me, I think the intentions are good(Plat 2 ADC main and I FUCKING HATE PANTHEON). Its in line with how they are treating long range ults as a whole(TF, Noc etc.). The problem is 100% the lack of counter play to Pantheons post 6 play. It just too face roll to press R from across the map and double kill bot lane. I think they should remove all changes except the ult range. This will allow lanes to ward appropriately to prevent him from ganking, but still allow him to punish lanes that don't invest the resources in vision.Summary:
Summarize: background: i am 17 andmy parents dont know i smoke so i have to keep my smoking a secret, but they are fully aware of my brothers smoking habits though) I was coming home from smoking at my girlfriends, i was at a 6. when i came home my mom was downstairs waiting for me which seemed kind of odd. i said hi and tried to act normal. after a brief coversation she went into the kitchen and asked me to follow. when we went in the kitchen my favorite pipe "spyro" was sitting on the counter and i knew i was fucked. i tried to act like i couldnt tell while my mind raced for an explanation. i quickly said my brother had left it in his room and i was holding it for him (he lives about an hour away at my dads house) which she didnt believe. i didnt back down though and stuck to my story. i went upstairs to confront my stepdad and tell him my story. he then said he didnt believe me and pulled out a bowl that i must have left in my hiding spot and forgot about. so then i start to think that im fucked again. i told them that it was my brothers as well and i was planning on throwing it away but i was too sketched to transport it through the house. (to this day my stepdad still doesnt believe me). my brother worked the nightshift so there was a good chance that he was working at that time but my mom decided to call him. i then for the third time thought i was fucked. thankfully he didnt pick up so i sent him a text telling him to go with whatever they say. but me stepdad picked up on me texting and put two and two together so i tried deleting the message before he looked at my phone. so now for the 4th time i thought i was fucked. but the gods shined upon me and the messages finished erasing right as he took my phone. in the morning my brother called my mom back and took credit for the pipe and said he didnt remember leaving the weed there but it was probably his. i owed him big time and later smoked him out for helping me and now my parents trust in me has been slowly restored.Summary:
Summarize: And I've been wanting to get a straight razor. Looking through the posts on here about them and their condition, I have no clue what I should be looking for. What pitting is ok and what says no, don't buy this. Also, what are the implications of a 5/8 vs. Other fractions?Summary:
Summarize: The Republicans are stubborn when it comes to taxing the upper 2% of Americans, and insist on taxing the working class. I have no prior knowledge of economics, and I am only in high school, but it makes complete common sense to reduce taxes on the working class so they will buy more goods and stimulate the economy, and gently tax the rich to cover the tax reductions. I don't think Republicans understand that if the economy is shit and our country goes bankrupt, they won't have a job. Trust me, I am really not trying to be biased, but its hard with all the stupid bullshit that's going on over in the right side of congress. That is all.Summary:
Summarize: I had a buddy who was going down a declined street on his BMX when a car pulled out in front of him. On impact he flew over the trunk of the car and down the street, putting out both arms to try and break his fall he hyper extended both his arms at the elbows and was restricted to slings for the next 6 weeks. His GF at the time took on the responsibility of dressing him, feeding him, cleaning him and wiping his ass.Summary:
Summarize: On the right side, the thralls tend to come up the stairs consistently. On the left side, they normally stop about 1/4th of the way up the stairs unless you are within melee range. While on either side, you have to deal with the Knights in the towers shooting down on you and the melee knight that jumps down in the middle walkway. When the ogres spawn, a large wave of thralls also spawn and quickly rush each side. But you can quickly and easily shoot at the ogres when they spawn if you are on one of the sides. If you are down bottom, you can more safely kill the ogres, but it takes longer for them to walk down towards the large stairs for you to gain sight of them. When you're down bottom, you have to wait for Crota to leave the sides and return to middle or hug the wall next to him to avoid being shot by him. If you're on the opposite side as him, he may also shoot across though if you're too close. The swordbearer typically runs down towards the stairs more quickly than running towards the sides. You can coax him over to the sides though by shooting him once to gain his attention.Summary:

He loves looking at my ass and squeezing it and seeing me take him in. After what I believed was a good workout I hopped off and wrapped my mouth around him. I sucked all of my juices off of him. But I could only go so long wothout it and I started riding him again, leaning over to nibble his ears. The way he was grabbing me, the almost grunts I could hear, I knew he wanted it harder so I gave it to him, but before long he had me on my back again, with a pillow underneath me and my legs over his shoulders. He knows I love this, the slow deep thrusts and the way it makes his pelvis rub against my clit. It wasn't long befire my knees were buckling again and he started riding me hard, pushing my body towards the edge of the bed. By the time we finished my head and shoulders were hanging off. We didn't notice this but the clock in the room was an hour ahead so we didn't think we had much time afterward. We layed there relaxing and laughing and snuggling until he got into the shower. I watched him get dressed longingly and he came back to bed. It is always so hard for either of us to leave, and he started teasing me again. He was kissing my neck, which drives me crazy, and I alid his hand between my legs to show him exactly how crazy. Once he felt how badly I wanted him he started using thise fingers. Moaning and writhing he asked "can I make you cum like this?". I had to be honest. The answer was no. No one can, I barely can make it work myself. So he left me like that! All worked up wth no release. . . . . .Summary:
Summarize: I'm very sorry that your first thought when seeing a cry for help was to doubt the story, insult a 16 year old girl who's been through utter Hell, and slather on as much sarcasm as you could muster. We are trying every possible avenue in order to find her and give her the help she desperately needs. Reddit is capable of so much good in the world, and has been responsible for some great miracles. It's my hope that maybe one more could be done. I further hope that you never run into a situation where you may feel the need to try something, anything, in order to get help. But if you ever do find yourself there, I hope that you'll never encounter someone as callous as yourself.Summary:
Summarize: I know a woman who was "hopelessly single" until she was about 50 and then she bagged a recently divorced semi-wealthy 60 yr old man. Of course, she claimed that she would not stop doing nails when she got married. She came back from the honeymoon and announced she was retiring.Summary:
Summarize: I don't think that it warrants joining the forever alone bandwagon. For some background story: last year I dated a 27 year old guy (I was 20 at the time). I was finishing my sophomore year of college and he was finishing his masters degree after returning to school from industry. We were both MechE (a major without a lot of females) and in the same research group. It wasn't until after a month of dating did he tell me that he had never had a girlfriend and was a virgin. It didn't really matter to me; he was a great guy, cook, lover, and mentor. Things went horribly wrong once school ended. Summer came and I decided to break it off since long distance wasn't working. This is when he proceeded to freak out. He was determined that I would be the only girl for him and that we were going to get married, etc. I'm still young and not ready for those things. His freak out evolved into some sort of sick obsession which ended in me barely talking to him since.Summary:
Summarize: I had a vegan as a legal guardian for 2 years when I was 15. Biggest fucking bitch this side of the planet. She would always force her bullshit veganism on me. When I had enough of her shit food (she was a shit cook), I decided to get a job to buy the food (read: meat, cheese, eggs) that I wanted. Nope. She would not allow me to store meat or any other non vegan food in the fridge . So I said I would save up and buy a mini-fridge. Also nope. She said if I wanted to eat meat, I would have to find another place to live. That's exactly what I did. I called up my mom and convinced her to take me back. I lived in Alberta at the time, and she flew me all the way back to Québec. I flipped my entire life upside down just to get away from that crazy bitch Best. Decision. Ever.Summary:
Summarize: One more cop story about my uncle who is a cop in Littleton (he has so many good ones). This wasn't actually an arrest since the guy was dead. Anyways, they get a call about a weird smell coming from a guys apartment, like decomposing flesh. So they get in there and find this guy butt naked dead in his bedroom. He is laying on his back with a giant dildo coming out the side. So they place bets on whether it is in our out when they flip him over. It was in, come to find it, there was another foot long dildo up there. So this guy rammed a foot long dildo up his colon, and another one about half way up and then died basically. They also found an ironing board upside down, picture the X shape the legs make. On one side of the X leg was a dildo attached, so this guy would ride the iron so the one leg would shove the dildo up his ass. One more fun fact, they found zero porn in this guys place, just a picture of a deer tapped to the wall by the ironing board.Summary:

Summarize: not sure if this is a vent. it feels odd. 8 weeks ago our pekingese gave birth to 5 puppies fathered by my little shih tzu buddy. 7 from the last sentence. we also had a shih-poo and a cocker spaniel/golden retriever mix. it was arranged to get rid of 2 of the puppies yesterday as they were ready to leave. 9-2=7. she put an ad on craigslist to get rid of the shih-poo and the coggle for free. an hour later a couple showed up to take the shih-poo. in the morning a middle aged single lady comes to pick up the coggle. 7-2=5. I wanted to keep the one puppy [Peanut]( he was cool. being emotionally attached to an entity and it leaving is a feeling I'm not used to, especially since 4 left. shrug. here's the [puppies at my feet]( the one on the very right, and the second from the left departed.

Summarize: Just wanted to say thanks to all of you who showed concern over my well being. Much love. I'd kiss all of you but, internet. But anyways my first post is here and btw, I'm 17. I just turned 17 a week ago and still getting used to acknowledging I'm now a year older. So I took some of your guys advice which was to talk to my mom. But I had no luck in getting my points across. I was lectured about how the xbox makes me a violent person. And after I tried explaining I needed help, she ignored it and continued lecturing me saying I needed to stop trying to act like an adult. And then continued to lecture me on how the devil is tied into all of the violent games I play. And then the whole time I kinda just sat there and listend. I did kind of ignored most of it since she wasn't understanding what was going on. But here go the subtitles. Mom- "You're only 17 adrian. In less than 11 months, you're going to be 18, in college, and no longer here. And you think your roommates will tolerate this behavior?" Me- "No." "Then why do you act like this towards me. I am your mother and I deserve your respect. The door is replacable. But the words you used towards and against me are not." " I didn't mean any of it. I was just mad-" "Mad because I took your xbox?" "No I was mad because I don't know. I freaked out. Normally I would just go upstairs. I don't remember punching the door. And the whole time I was yelling at you, I was just yelling just to yell. I had no motive. Normally I would just shrug it off but I just ticked. And I'm sorry. I didn't mean it when i called you stupid." (My father was a verbal abusive guy and an alcoholic and always called her names which is why she hates it. She always compares me to my father which makes me even more mad at times. I don't even know the fucking guy.) "And you call me bipolar. You have 3 younger brothers, how do you think they will respond to this. They look up to you. You're they're father and they're going to grow up fucked up seeing you act like this." (I think It might be genetics at this point. We are all fucked.) I apologized and then went to bed since I had work in the morning. She said she would try contacting a therapist. Hopefully she does. Now it's the next day. Today. Hand is swolen, don't really want to encounter any other human beings. But If I don't I'll get fired and I need to buy a new door. Im at work, and my manager asks what happened. I tell her I got into a fistfight with my door. She's a bit sarcastic which I enjoy cause it's funny and she asks me if I won. I laugh and say I punched it in half. And then the rest of the day is pretty much the same. I'm still mad at myself. I down really have much will to do anything at the moment. I just really want to go to the gym and blow off some steam. But I know my wish won't get granted since everyone at home is pretty much avoiding eye contact with me. I'm overeating again. I just ate 3 bags of Jack links beef jerky. And then water of course. I don't know what to do now. My crush asked what happened and I refused to tell her about it. I can't bring myself to talk about it anymore because it makes me more upset. I really just want to lay in bed and watch youtube videos of cats.Summary:
Summarize: Those are just as bad or worst than the Daily Show, and Reddit in terms of biases. The recent Dorner thing was a perfect example of that from what I know. I watched news on TV, as does my dad, and I've seen plenty of coverage on Dorner. The fact is, neither of us have heard a damn thing about the LAPD shooting at those asian women, or the other innocent bystander. The MSM puts an entirely different narrative on the entire situation, and pretend like the police are great.Summary:
Summarize: Link to original: Also I know nobody's asked for an update, I just need advice and feel the entire situation would be helpful. So I went to the study thing, and it was chill. We just kinda hung out and got to know each other. At the end I got her number and said "I'd like to hang out some time, y'know without homework?" And she said sure. At the end I was so happy that it went well that I kinda bailed mid-conversation, which left her slightly miffed and me feeling like a dick. I texted her right after and said "Hey, sorry I kinda took off. I'll make it up to you haha." And she said basically that it was fine, she didn't notice. So my question now is, what to do? I'd like to text her and just start chatting but I don't know if that'd be weird the same day I got her number, and if she'd expect me to ask her on a date right away. I've never really gotten this far with a girl, so what should I do?Summary:
Summarize: Not having such a narrow view of how things work may help you (maybe not you specifically) be a better player and not require changes to suit that narrow style. The one thing consistent in Elder Scrolls, since Arena (ignoring Redguard) has always been, versatility beats narrow. It's one of the few things ESO did right. > Rogue is a classic RPG character that wears leather armour and focuses on stealth & dexterity, dealing high single target damage to enemies from stealth and all kinds of tricks, such as restealthing/vanishing, different stuns, incapacitates, blinding powder etc. In other RPGs. This isn't a typical RPG, this is Elder Scrolls. There are no classes (outside of ESO and Arena) in this world. A "Thief" is just someone who picks locks, a "Warrior" is just a guy with a weapon. There are no classes, only roles. Your role is whatever you are doing at this exact moment. > The reality in ESO is, that you cannot play a character similar to what is described above. Yes, you can. People do it all the time. They aren't good at it because they cannot switch roles into something else when the time calls, and thus get crushed. They fail to get the quick kill before their opponent gets up they become completely unable to fight back against them, as they've used all their resources. > Restealthing or vanishing in combat is not possible for anyone but Nightblades via Shadow Cloak, Not true, there are two ways. Potions and Line of Sight. Duck behind a tree, stealth up and you're good to go. This doesn't work near keeps but they were designed to 'protect' their area thus preventing stealth. In the open world this works beautifully. Potions also give you invis, not every person in the game carries detection potions and if they do they rarely have them 100% at the ready. Pop invis, go stealth and most times you're fine. If anything this shouldn't be possible. > Sneak attack damage on live is the closest resemblance we have to the classic rogue/assassin gameplay Because 1 shots are fun for everyone involved... There is no reason I should be able to top 3700 damage from a single stealth shot. (Not including Heavy attack cancelling, thats one single hit) This isn't balance, this is dumb and needs to be fixed. Just so happens not many people know how to do it, so it's kept in check. You also lose any ability to actually fight, so its a gimmick at best. > Due to lack of reliable crowd control (as they can all be broken) Not everything is strictly CC. There are other ways to mitigate damage besides CC. > ... that they do not match the dmg shield spam or healing. Shield Damage (Blazing Shield/Frag Shield) can both be mitigated by moving away. I haven't been killed or heavily damaged by a damage shield in a LONG time by learning to move away. > The burst damage seems to be going away, which is the only aspect of rogue/assassin gameplay we currently have. It isn't going away, it's just being toned down to not 1 shot people anymore. Plus it's not even the damage that's dangerous from stealth, its the stun that happens. Focusing only on your damage numbers is a great way to miss everything else that happens in a fight. Hell it's one of the reasons I recently killed myself to razor armor, I didn't watch, I was just focused on dealing damage. It got me killed, and a good lesson to pay attention. Lets take Rock Paper Scissors. You REALLY FUCKING LOVE Rock. Rock always wins, so you always play rock. Fuck Paper, they cheat. Rock beats Scissors, but loses to Paper. For weeks you're beating the crap out of Scissors, then one day you meet up with Paper and they smother you. You get pissed, res and go after them again. Again they smother you. So instead of picking up some Scissor skills and cutting the paper, you keep smashing your head into paper and they keep on suffocating you. Every 'good' build in existence (that people who complain about these types of things generally hate because they want to make their 'own' build ignoring all other information), especially dueling builds are all built around one thing: Be able to do everything. Don't give yourself a weakness on purpose if you can avoid it, doing so will only end in Paper smothering you. Take this to heart and change your style to match the mechanics, then things like stealth damage being reduced won't even phase you.Summary:
Summarize: This reminds me of when I was in the 8th grade chess club. One weekend, the Chess club was going to a town that was about 2-3 hours away for a tournament. I got up early to walk to a friend's house to catch a ride. After getting up and getting ready, I walked down the hall (with my dog Jasper following me) and my dad came out of his bedroom. We talked for a couple of minutes, he gave me some money for food/snacks/whatever. My dog was patiently sitting there looking at the both of us. Just as we finished talking, we both looked down at Jasper and he looked at me. At that exact moment, in the quiet early morning, he farted. He turned and looked at his butt (without sitting up), then looked at the both of us with an expression on his face like he was surprised. My dad and I both busted up laughing.Summary:
Summarize: Im a 23 year old girl in a big city, and I'm pretty typical. Stable home, cool siblings, modern lifestyle. Nothing about me screams "immoral slut". Except John. I met John in university when I was dating his friend. John and I had an immediate connection and it very quickly took over what I felt for his friend. We would talk for hours about any and everything. The mental and physical connection we have is indescribeable. Emotionally, however, there was never much there. We both realized soon enough that we had a thing for watching each other get off and we shared a mutual love for all things Tantra. I'll make this simple: With all of our other partners, we had to learn how to have an orgasm, ie: actively think about and focus until we came. With each other, it was the opposite. We had to fight to not orgasm a minute or so in. We are two sides of the same coin it seemed, our energy was parallel... even intertwined. Sadly, we lost contact. Fast forward 6 years and we meet up for coffee. Its like not a day went by since we last saw each other. He is now married, and I've been seeing someone for a few months. We know we want each other, there is not getting around this fact. He asks me if I believe there are certain people who are meant to be in your life... I do believe that. He asks me what I would do to keep those people in my life. I can see where he is going with this, we never want to stop being in each others lives. We don't want the conversations to end, the advice to stop, and the incredible moments of ecstacy to be lost. I know I should feel like this is wrong. He's married to a wonderful, beautiful woman. I'm seeing someone really hot (there's not much else to say for him TBH). He loves her, I know this... But I feel like a sociopath in that I cannot see whats so wrong with getting off with someone you feel so connected to and leaving it there. I've never felt any desire to date him or bring him to parties, dinner, etc... In spite of (and considering) all I've said, Reddit, should I stop? It should be noted that we take many precautions to ensure we are both clean (monthly check ups) and we very rarely have any sort of penetration. Safe sex = good sex!!Summary:
Summarize: Ok first off, yes I know they are stinky as Shit lol I'm just wondering. I have smoked one in a basement before but it was already filled up with smoke so I couldn't really tell how bad the blunt smelled. I live with my parents who are cool with me smoking, but I don't want the smell to leave the room- is that possible? Also it's not like I have to do it in my room, but if it's possible that would be a good thing to know. I've smoked with a gravity bong in my room before no problem. Also, does the tobacco make a difference in smell? Because the bathroom is kinda the designated smoke spot but if it smells worse I don't want to fuck it up. I guess that's it,Summary:
Summarize: I'm taking a small break from College Chronicles to give you my most recent hamplanet excursion. Feel free to skip the background and head straight to the story if you'd like. Background Let me rest your jimmies by telling you that I am now 26, graduated from college in 2010, therefore I'm very much alive and was not, in fact, flayed like so many of you are worried about. After college, I got a job in advertising, so a lot of my job is sitting all day. Some days it's 6 hours, some days it's 12 hours. But it's lots of microsoft office and indesign. I quickly gained weight and went from about 110 in college to 145 in 2012. Not planetary status, but 35 pounds was enough to make my 5'4" frame cry. Last year Mrwonderful and I decided to do something about it (yes we are married now)! He kicked it into gear and went from 210 - 185 with P90X. I unfortunately was off and on making excuses. I dropped about 11 pounds. This year I kicked it into high gear. Since January 1 I've gone from 134 - 124. Booya. I also just received a promotion so we decided to celebrate last night. This is where our story begins. Story >Be Polar. Celebrating promotion and 10 pound droppage with buddies. >Don't Be RiledRhino. Hammy of planetary proportions. We arrive at a bar we frequent many weekends and thirsty thursdays. So much so the bouncer knows us and always just waves us in. It's a divey place, we did enough of the downtown-10-dollars-for-college-beer crap in high school and college. Tonight we were celebrating, I just got a promotion this week. Bonus celebration, I hit the 10 pounds lost mark. Drinks on me! I learned a valuable lesson about the relationship between losing pounds and losing my tolerance level. One beer and two measly vodka tonics in and I was a goner. I'm very much a happy, hyper, love everything type of drunk and it's pretty obvious I'm blasted. That's when I notice RiledRhino laughing and pointing at me from the other side of the bar. I scurry over. >Polar: Hey! What are we laughing about? I'm Polar by the way. >RiledRhino: Yeah no thanks. And you. I'm laughing at you. Didn't I make that obvious enough? >Polar: Hey I'm just having a good time with some friends. Nothin' wrong with that. You guys should join us! >RiledRhino: There is when your skanky ass is wack dancing all over the place. Ugh, thin girls piss me off something fierce. >Polar: What exactly did I do to you? >RiledRhino: Girl this is my bar, you walking in here is what you did. Take your lightweight ass home bitch. I've never seen this girl here. I call her out. >Polar: Hey Bouncer! Have you seen this chick here before? She says it's her bar. >Bouncer: Nope. First time in my life. >Polar: So what about this being your bar? >RiledRhino: Please. Like he's going to side with me, he's a fatshaming douchebag anyway. Now go away lightweight loser. >Polar: Are.. you.. are you like jealous of me being a lightweight or something? >RiledRhino: Actually I'm offended by it. It's so typical for thin girls. But no, I'm the unhealthy one. Right? >Polar: I don't know. Are you? Why is it so damn offensive? >RiledRhino: This is the perfect example of society's standards and how fucked they are. Look how sad and pathetic your organs are. They can't even keep up with your little tiny girly drinks. That's healthy? >Polar: Umm... >RiledRhino: No seriously. Nevermind that I can handle my booze. I've been throwing these back like water and I'm not half as retarded as you. My fat makes my organs stronger because they work harder. It gives me more muscle and alcohol tolerance. But let's all praise the skinny white trash for meeting the world's expectations. PATHETIC. >Polar: Muscle? All I see is fat. There's that whole drunk alpha-ing up thing that seems to get me in trouble. >RiledRhino: It's under a protective layer of skin dumbass. >Polar: I really think you're calling the wrong person dumbass. >RiledRhino: EXCUSE ME BROKE BITCH? She lost it and got in my face. Bouncer did his job and bounced her rhino pack out of the bar. I went back to making life decisions I would regret this morning.Summary:
Summarize: They won't turn you in That's right, and that's wrong. If you tell them about your urges, and how you feel, they cannot reveal that to anyone you don't give explicit permission to. HOWEVER! If you say something, and they think you may be a danger to yourself, or anybody else, they are obligated to report that to the police, along with any relevant information they may need. (Note: Check your local ethics code that psychiatrists follow, and any mandatory reporting laws. They shouldn't be able to report something that happened in the past, but that is all up to the area you live in) I know this, as when I was younger, my mom went on a trip, and I had the place to myself for a week. Before she went to the airport, she dropped my off at my therapist. My therapist said something that triggered memories of severe abuse from my father. Usually, I just break down and cry during those times. But the therapist kept pushing and pushing despite the fact I said I wasn't ready to confront those memories. She kept pushing and pushing. Eventually, I just went numb. I felt no emotion, I felt like I had nothing to lose. I just stood up, walked to the door, opened it, turned towards the psychiatrist and said "Don't worry, after this weekend my father will no longer be an issue in my life, or anyone elses". I left, and caught the bus to go home to get a weapon, and kill him. That was fully my intention, as at the time, I was apathetic to the consequences of my actions. I felt that by killing him, I would save another helpless child from being abused the way I was. However, the bus ride home was pretty long. Just over an hour. During the time away from the psychiatrist, I started to regain my emotions. Regain my sense of self, and how no matter how evil my father was, I couldn't stoop to his level. I got off at the last bus stop, which is usually where I would get off to go home. Instead of walking home, I walked 2 minutes in the opposite direction, and went to the RCMP station. I intended to finally, after many years, have my father charged with the abuse throughout the years. I was in an "interrogation" room for over an hour, answering questions. The officer excused himself, got up and left for a moment to check on something. He came back 20 minutes later with 3 officers, and they strip searched me to ensure I had no weapons, and put me in handcuffs, and took me to a youth mental health ward for an overnight examination (I was released the following morning). Never once did they ask if I wanted to continue with pressing charges. They ignored the fact that I did the responsible thing and went to an RCMP station to do what needed to be done to get closure instead of being violent and ending my fathers life. All they cared about was that the municipal police had issued a notice to urgently bring me in to the mental health ward for examination. To me, it felt like they didn't care about me, or what I went through. I tried twice after that throughout the years to press charges against my father. The first time, the RCMP told me that I could only press charges in the province in which it started , despite it occurring throughout several provinces (5 to be exact). The second time, I contacted a legal advise line run by the provincial government. I explained why I wanted to press charges, and possibly get help as it was a sensitive issue. The cunt on the other end of the line told me to suck it up, and being abused as a male wasn't half as bad as being abused by a female. I said some things after that to her on the phone that, if I said it to anyone else I would feel ashamed. But to her? No. She belittled the abuse I went through, and made me feel worthless, all because I wasn't an abused female. I was in a mental health "clubhouse" at the time (Laing House in Halifax), and a few case workers had to pry the phone away from me and forcibly drag me into another room to calm me down. They didn't call the police, and for that, i'm grateful. Now, before any of you start bashing police in response to me, please. Don't. I lost respect for the officers that I spoke with in regards to the abuse. I still have, and will continue to have, tremendous respect for the RCMP, and other provincial and municipal police. I'm not going to hold the actions of a few against the whole. edit:Summary:
Summarize: So I've had to answer this a few times and I'm getting tired of so many people asking this question without searching for the answer beforehand. Here's the question: "So do I do the false ending at the beginning of X Chapter? What's the best time? Can I do the true ending then go back and do the false? DO I RESTART THE GAME?" So the way the endings work is let's say you're in chapter 5 (when the false is available at first), any crystal from that point on can be used in order to trigger the false ending. What both endings do is take you out of your current chapter and put you into the FINAL chapter. What happens after you finish the FINAL chapter, is it puts you back to the beginning of whatever chapter you were doing when you got the ending. So for the true ending, it puts you back at the beginning of Chapter [] (#s "8"), and for the false ending it will put you back at the beginning of whatever chapter you accessed it on. So if you started it at chapter 5 and you beat the false ending, you go back to the beginning of chapter 5. All you have to do is reawaken the crystals to continue the game after either ending. THIS GAME IS CONTINUABLE AFTER EACH ENDING. You can do the true ending, then the false ending, because after the true ending it puts you back to the beginning of chapter [] (#s "8"), where you can just go and do the thing you do with a crystal to get the false ending. NEW GAME + DOES NOT WRITE OVERWRITE YOUR FINISHED SAVE, IT TAKES A SEPARATE SLOT UNLESS YOU MANUALLY SAVE OVER YOUR COMPLETED GAME Thank you. There should be no spoilers aside from the fact that there are more than one ending in this game, but we all know that.Summary:
Summarize: Hate the person, not the program. There is nothing wrong with WIC or EBT...but yes, ANYONE can be an idiot. People on those programs are not stupider than those not on it, they aren't lazier, life happens. Recession happens, feeding your child happens. There was a fair bit of bashing on here, so I wanted to point that out.Summary:
Summarize: OMG So, a few months ago I asked a question about "Coming Out" And now... I'm out with a few friends. It started with one of my best friends from high school. As mentioned in the post I linked to above, her boyfriend and his ex-girlfriend experimented with bondage and such. When I was hanging out with her and her boyfriend during Thanksgiving break, we went to an upscale sex shop. We all eventually wondered over to the kinkier section, and her bf and I were discussing things like how silly it was to pay so much money for the rope cuffs they had, and how ridiculous the rhinestone encrusted handcuffs were, and I showed him how the nipple clamps were adjustable, and so on. My friend said something like, "I know why he knows all this. But, OQG, I'm surprised about you!" And so, long story short, she now knows... quite a few things. Not everything about me. But most things. I'm terrible with secrets. Especially with my best of friends. And after learning that they are experimenting, I did a motherly safety talk to make sure they were being safe. Goodness. And then there was the old friend from high school. We had been ok friends. Mostly out of convenience- my main friends didn't have the same lunch hour as me, so I sat with her and some other ok-friends. She graduated early, and I lost contact with her. Fast forward to a month-ish ago. She gets FB. We reconnect. We both hint at a couple of things, and pick up on those hints. And, low and behold, she's also into BDSM. And we are both like, "OMG, this is awesome! We can go to the Folsom Street Fair together! And all sorts of things! And we will be a perfect alibi for friends and family; when asked where we are going, it's to visit an old high school friend." I hung out with her a bit during winter break, and it was super fun. And then there's another high school friend. I haven't really come out to her, but she's revealed to me that she's now into kinky things. Which is kind of adorable. She was so ridiculously innocent when I first met her. First I taught her sarcasm (to teach a person sarcasm, just be sarcastic at them till they get it) and then things like what the difference between a dildo and a vibrator was (long story. She and another friend knew nothing about sex, despite having dated multiple guys. While I hadn't even been kissed at the time, I knew knowledge was important, so educated myself about all sorts of things. One night we were hanging out and I learned of their ignorance and we had a long educational talk. It was... interesting). And then the other day she said that she is into "crazy" things. And has a whip, which she thinks is quite fun. So I'll probably eventually end up coming out to her. Although she's kind of horrible with secrets, so maybe not. And then yesterday I was hanging out with a good friend that's in a club I'm in. I knew she had slept with the aforementioned Creepy BDSM Guy. Which I didn't approve of, because he's crazy sketch. But it turns out that it's actually something she's in to. The result of that conversation was that she convinced me to get a FetLife account (username: "Not Green Tea" but without spaces). And we are hopefully going to go to a Kinky Coffee thing some day at a nearby city. She's actually the first one of all these people to know the word "munch" This is all... quite exciting.Summary:
Summarize: I just got home from a 6 hour drive from Washington to Oregon and I only stopped once to go pee. so I had to shit extremely bad. I get home and as soon as I open the door I start taking my pants and my boxers off. I run to the hallway and then I notice my mother and father grabbing their TV I had borrowed. My penis hanging out them looking at me with TV in hand I run to my kitchen while they leave and I don't know if I should talk to them.Summary:
Summarize: I feel that you guys are giving way too much hate about russians. Everytime I get into a match and a russian opens his mouth, everyone goes bananas and mock him. If he chokes and fails to kill one, everyone put blames on him. Always complain the russians. I've met countless russians who have been very cooperative, some can be ragey and some can be very very ignorant. A couple of weeks ago, I was playing nuke and I had 3 russians and 1 dude(forgot the name of the country). It was 6-0 to the enemy team and this dude was sure angry about the russians because they barely got any kills and they haven't said a single thing, he sure complained a lot to the enemy team, then he asked me how I felt about them, I told him "I don't dislike russians but I dislike people who won't communicate". All the russians started to communicate we won the match easily, the dude never said a single bad word about them. If you guys always complain and put the blame on the russians, of course they will perform super bad, they get frustrated every match and no one is willing to give them a chance. This way they will never improve. It's not only the russians, this whole rage, toxic thing applies to everyone. Some people screams/mock them because they can't speak english. For fuck sake people, give them a fucking chance because they're trying at least. This will only destroy their confident and they will never try to talk in english again.Summary:
Summarize: I have liked a guy for 2.5 years, and we were coworkers for the first year of that. I never made a move because I didn't want to cause an awkward work situation and had self-confidence issues. He's been going through a rough patch for the past year and is pulling away from everyone in general. Last week, I finally decided I was ready to tell him I liked him. I sent him a text to check up on him and asked to take him out to lunch (he's broke). He said he'd be honored, and I sent him one flirty text after that, which he responded well to (although I couldn't tell if he realized I was flirting, especially since I'm not that great at it). I don't completely know what possessed me, but I decided I didn't want to wait three days until lunch to tell him, so I called him the next day and completely confessed my attraction. Bluntly... aaaaand a little explicitly at one point. I didn't hold back at all, and he took it... surprisingly well. He definitely didn't say he isn't interested, but he certainly didn't say he is interested either. I'm not going to give you a play by play of the whole call, but I do have some questions: 1) After my initial spiel, he said, "Wow, I had no idea!" and "I wish you would have said something a couple years ago." Note that a mutual friend and coworker "dated" him and broke his heart at one point (he has not had good luck with female family and friends and has said that he's done with my entire gender). Does this mean that he wishes I would have said something before she got to him, or what? 2) He was complimentary of me the whole time. "See, this is what I like about you, [throwamaybe], you're such a unique girl. I really admire your honesty." At one point, he said, "You're attractive." If you were letting someone down easy, you wouldn't be telling them that you liked their personality and found them attractive, would you? Or is he just really bad at it? 3) When I was a little more explicit in my confession, I apologized about making it extra awkward for him. He said, "Actually, it's not as awkward as you would think on a personal level." What does that even mean?! "On a personal level?!" Does it mean it's not awkward because he wants it? Because he appreciates my honesty? Because he thinks friends should be able to be open about this stuff? Because he doesn't have casual sex and therefore hasn't had any in 1.5 years and is considering this with his dick? 4) As our call was drawing to a close, he said, "I just have one question for you: [pause] doesn't it feel good to get that off your chest?" Obviously yes. I cant figure out if he was going to ask something romantic/sexual and chickened out or why else he would have bothered to ask it. Keep in mind that there were no awkward silences for either of us to fill at any point. 5) He agreed we were still on for lunch, and I made a comment about not jumping him in the parking lot. His response: "Yeah, probably not the best place for that, you know..." in a semi-flirtatious way. Does that mean he's considering this?! Anyway, I didn't talk to him for a couple days because I didn't want to seem clingy, and then half an hour before we were scheduled to meet for lunch, he texted to cancel because he was "hungover as shit." Knowing him, I don't think he was lying, but I suppose it's possible. I told him I hoped he felt better, offered to bring him something if he needed it, and told him to let me know if he felt up to dinner later. All was well. A couple hours later, I sent him one more blatantly flirtatious text. He didn't respond. I sensed that I had perhaps pushed him a bit too far and texted him that if I was making him at all uncomfortable to just say so, and I would stop immediately because I valued our friendship more than getting in his pants. He quickly replied, "Yeah, it is a little much. But I understand :) just don't lose your mind over it." I said, "Alright, haha. I'll go back to thinking with my brain. :)" He texted back a smiley, and I haven't spoken to him for a full day since. What the hell did he even mean by "don't lose your mind over it?!" Is he trying to humbly say that I shouldn't be that excited about his dick? That he doesn't want me, but I shouldn't feel bad about hitting on him? That he likes that I'm hitting on him, but I just need to not do it as much? Or something else entirely? Overall: What's going on? Is he just trying to process? Is he fence sitting until he decides one way or the other (and in which case, how will I know when he's decided)? Does he just want to wait until he sees me in person to tell me? Does it sound like he's into me or not? Is he trying to decide whether I'm worth giving dating a chance again? So much ambiguity - what should my next step be? Currently, I'm letting things cool off for while. Is this the right move?Summary:
Summarize: He's about to go into a game with 200-400 lb heavily muscled men who, despite wearing pads, are going to suffer multiple tackles and hits at enormous speeds. The physics of that alone can cause permanent brain damage ( source ). The league has started to pay more attention to it in recent years, but it shows just how violent the game can be despite being perceived as slow by new viewers or people who are used to rugby and such. Anyway, I said that not to bolster your argument that this guy is crazy because he's brain damaged, but to say that a slap or two compared to what's going on in the game is nothing. He's psyching himself up for the physical punishment he's about to put himself through. It's well worth it though. He's getting paid $8 million to do this at a high level for 2 years ( source ). If he performs well, he can expect to be paid more.Summary:
Summarize: I did this exact thing when they called me - I was bored and had played around for about 45 minutes. Originally he had got me to the eventviewer by spelling it out, e for egg, v for vision etc. I started having 'issues' and started spellling out the errors to him - f for foxtrot, u for uniform, c for charlie etc. I told him to suck my dick, eat my ass in the same way before he passed me off to his manager. His manager hung up fairly quickly. The kicker? The first guy who was too thick to pick up on what i was doing FUCKING CALLED BACK TO ABUSE ME! I shit you not. I remained calm and told him how much fun I had with him, he asked me to suck his dick, I said I'd love that because he sounds like a pretty boy. He was fucking furious, it was beautiful. I love the nerve of the asshole, calling back a potential target for wasting his precious time.Summary:
Summarize: Had 2 tabs each earlier this night with my gf snd our friend. Went to a park which is located on a hill. The view to the city is amazing. I was laying next to a small(ish) lake. Pelicans, ducks and some other water birds chillin', swimming around there. And the frogs quacking. Holy fuck how trippy it is to hear hundreds or even thousands of frogs quacking simultainiously. I was tripping there for at least 2 hours straight. It was amazing. Finally got home. Had a shower, because it's so damn hot. Got into bed next to my gf. When I suddenly felt sick and had to vomit.(I tend to get really nauseaus indoors). Brushed my teeth and back to bed! My gf soon fell a sleep(she had to wake up 1.5 h later to go to work). So here I am, left alone with my thoughts. The fan in the corner of my room was making this sound. It's quite trippy tbh. I switch it off just to switch it back on 5 minutes later(because it's so damn hot here). Here I am thinking and going through all the apects of this life, my life. When I suddenly come to a conclusion that I have to quit smoking. It was time for my gf to wake up. We snuggled, had sex. I made her some coffee. She had a cigarette and drank her coffee(only the half of it, we have so many cups half full laying around at the place). Off she went. I'm laying in my bed as I write this, and I have to say: I feel fucking amazing! Just something I wanted to share with you guys.Summary:

Summarize: My buddy, when setting up a wireless router, was asking me why he couldn't connect. I kept telling him to restart his laptop and he didn't listen but told me he had. After ten minutes of me trying to figure out what the problem was and failing I gave up. He texted me later saying he restarted his computer and it worked fine.Summary:
Summarize: Ok imma be honest with you. I genuinely don't really give a fuck anymore. I support gays for whatever the hell they want to do, I don't really care. I also don't give a flying fuck if they get upset over a damn word that isn't even targeted towards them in any way shape or form. Its like when someone calls a black guy a nigger and the white dude next to the black guy gets more offended than the black guy. Lastly, I don't give a fuck if other people don't support them. I won't bitch and complain like you and the 7 or 8 other maddys are doing to me. They have a reason for hating gays that 90% of the time will not be able to be wavered so why even bother?Summary:
Summarize: My thoughts 4 hours ago: "Okay I did my 90 days and now i went 2 weeks without a problem. I can handle it now. I showed discipline." That was just before i relapsed. 1 hour later i met with some friends to have some cake and drink a bit. Only Girl there told me that i will propably be a virgin forever. My thoughts now: "You F**ked up! Start Meditating again! 180 Days streak is next goal! Continue workouts they helped a lot!"Summary:
Summarize: Don't worry. I'm a complete idiot and I recognize some of that as electricity and magnetism diagrams/equations. And I can even tell you some of the mechanics that's on that board! There's a diagram on Raleigh Scattering (just left of center). A potential energy diagram for a bound system (the graph in the middle with the V(r) equation), a harmonic oscillator diagram of some sort right above that... I think.... I think there's a diagram explaining what would happen to an electron-proton system without Quantum Mechanics (the swirl above the triangle-thing). I see a diagram that I GUESS is supposed to be a proton with a wave-form electron around it (on the right)? And a Gaussian probability graph (also on the right). But like I said, I'm among the dumbest people I know (and I don't know that many extraordinary people).Summary:
Summarize: I was put off the sport at a young age by a shit coach (or so I'm told) and just picked it up again a year and a half ago. Currently having a blast, wish I'd played my whole life.Summary:
Summarize: Mine happened about 3 years ago. I had been on this medication for a couple months without incident until one morning I woke up with a diamond hard erection. It happens more times than not so I just ignored it and went about my morning routine. It didn't go down at all. So I gave myself a hand and waited. Still didn't go down. After a bit I did it again. It was the first time I didn't enjoy me time. Still rock hard. I ended up doing 4 or 5 times altogether, each time was worse than the last. In between times I had a bag of frozen broccoli on my crotch. Neither helped bring the theroyalkid down at all. I didn't have internet at the time, but I had seen a Martin Lawrence movie where he had taken viagra or something and was hoping to God that the movie was just making a joke as far as treatment. I sucked it up and started walking (no car) to the hospital. I stuck mostly to the back streets, but I did have to cross on to mainstreet to get there. I kept my head down, but heard some laughing that I'm pretty sure were about my obvious boner. When I finally got to the ER, it was of course packed and the twisted receptionist refused to hear me when I tried to whisper what the emergency was. 20 minute wait felt like hours. The people waiting with me were kind though and didn't laugh. When I did get in to see a doctor, he inspected it, left and came back with two other people, they inspected as well. He then informed me that he'd like to get an opinion from another doctor who had a practice downtown. So there I waited in a hospital gown, all the while different nurses coming in and out not even trying not to look. When the downtown practice guy got there he said he wanted to an ultrasound on it. Seemed legit. I was put in a wheelchair, and pushed to the elevator (with a bunch of people in it) to maternity of all departments and the technician did an ultrasound on my wood.(Think about that pregnant redditors) I'm still not sure what the ultrasound was supposed to accomplish. At that point, I was giving one word answers and trying not to cry of embarrassment. Eventually they got around to actually treating it. They tried this shot in my arm that was supposed to relax me, but it didn't work. So they numbed the area the best they could and with the biggest fucking needle I've ever seen drained the blood by poking it in different spots. Even numbed, it hurt so fucking much. My wang was bruised all over, it looked and felt awful for a few days, but besides that no permanent physical damage. Mentally though...I haven't been back to that ER since. So what's your hospital horror story?Summary:
Summarize: I don't know how I feel about you. Were you tormenting us for views on some GIANTDAD-style video? Or was this you own private hell I entered? One man, no, not a man. One Monster, deep in Aldrich territory, where no lone host should survive, broke us all. I was a lonely Finger, having a fine day collecting tongues for M'lady. I wasn't prepared for this. This thing, with skin that cut and bled us, and dark hands that glowed a pale red, glowing from all the blood on his hands. He was a ball of furious energy, just rolling and rolling and rolling and....... I was not alone in this torment, one of the Faithful was struggling with the beast, and another soon arrived. But this thing just laughed, mocking our attempts to slay it." Very Good " " Very Good " " Very GOOD ". Even together we were more risk to ourselves, such was our blind rage at this abomination, and any glancing blows we could land were washed away under his many restorative estus. Despite his pure evil, many a blue and Darkmoon bastard arrived to aid this foul creature, if you needed Proof to believe they are delusional for their persecution of us. I saw several of the Faithful die or banish themselves to escape this nightmare, but we that remained took our righteous frustrations out on the blues, and I claimed many a forked tongue for M'lady. In the end all the Faithful had resigned, their faith shattered in this cruel test, leaving me to face this monstrosity alone. I challenged the latest blue to end me from this darkness with what little honor I had left, to end my suffering or add to my tally I didn't not care which, and so he did. As I faded I heard once more, ^" Very ^Good I have seen glimpses of this hollowed beast in several worlds since, although I cannot be sure to trust my own eyes no more.

Summarize: My WTF for the week isn't a horrible story for once (at least not to me). I was asked to hang out for after a client meeting at 6pm when the producer was going to see if we needed to work that night or next day on changes. 6:30 rolls around and we find out we're making a "few" changes tonight. Whatever, they're small and won't take long. Nope. The creative went to town tweaking, and while for new illustrations from an artist. Dinner is ordered so I know it'll be a late night. While eating I find a stream of the Hawks game an have a couple beers throughout the game. We start editing and I help the editor get some assets ingested and go back to my office to watch the game while I'm not needed in the room. All in all I got paid hourly to drink and watch hockey all night.Summary:
Summarize: About two months ago I drove from Flagstaff to Phoenix, with my friends D and N, to go to a rave (Rainbow Brite 2) We have plenty of money (for broke ass people), a new sack of dank buds, an old sack of perfectly cured dank buds (PERFECT!!!) and the next forty-eight hours to party like we mean it. We cruse down the road blasting tunes and rocking out. We smoke bowls (should we pack #1 or #2 dude?) and eat snacks. We bought a bunch of string cheese, snack bars, juice and other awesome munchies. We get to the party and during the securing of the car and stashing our valuables I can't find my wallet. I figure I won't stress it because I still have all my money and I can find my wallet latter. When we get to the security guy we won't let us in because I don't have I.D. to prove I am not 16 (I am 21 and most people think I am quite a it older) and my friend D does not have any I.D. either so we can't get in. We dejectedly walk back to the car feeling really let down. We get back to the car and drive off into the city and start calling everyone we know in Phoenix because we still want to party and have allot of money and weeds. We are smoking and driving and I decide to pull off the road so I won't be driving all erratic while I look up numbers. As we are sitting of the side of the road I see a big white pedo-van pull out of the ally behind us and as it turns I see the rack of sirens. They are obviously going to come investigate us so I decide if I drive away (in a reasonable manner) I have a slightly better chance of them not investigating us. I have a warm pipe with a half smoked bowl sitting in my lap so I put it in my pocket because I know I can't hide it anywhere in my car this quick. After following us for a few blocks they flip on their sirens right before I pull out onto a major street (why do they always pull you over in really shitty spots) and two cops hop out. A female cop comes up to my window and asks for my papers. I tell her I don't have my license but I give her my registration and insurance though. A male cop walks up to the passenger window and says "I smell weed in the car" and pulls N out of the front seat and sits him on the curb and pulls D out of the back seat (my cars a two door) as I am giving the female cop my info he says "Get her out of the car it smells like weed" referring to me. I am a man but I have long hair and he only saw me from behind, it happens sometimes. Despite the fact that I was going to jail I thought that was kind of funny. The female cop then pulls me out of the car and handcuffs me, pats me down, she feels the pipe and ask if she can get stuff out of my pockets I tell her no (can't search me without a warrant bitches) so she sits me on the curb and goes and has a brief conversation with her partner than climbs into their van starts running all our info (remember two of us have no ID on us). The guy cop is grilling my friends and one of them ( I think D) tells the cop that yes we were smoking in the car. As he digs through the car he finds my sneak-a-toke and another one hitter in my friends bag. He now has two counts of paraphernalia against us. He keeps re asking us who we are and why we are there (trying to catch us lying) I will answer some of his questions be I don't say anything self incriminating. I admit nothing but my friends are not so strong willed. After looking through my car as thoroughly as he can with out breaking protocol. "So why are you guys in Phoenix?" "To go to a rave, we couldn't get in." "So you guys have a bunch of ecstasy in the car. Thats what people do at raves right?" "Fuck that shit, some people go for the dancing and music." "Right..." He comes up to me and asks pointblank what we were smoking out of, I know he knows I have a pipe in my pocket so i decide that I might as well give it to him, I really don't like the idea of giving a cop a pipe with weed in it but He knows it is there and already has plenty to arrest me for so I give it to him. A little while latter he comes back over (it felt like forever but it was probably like thirty seconds) and asks was that all the weed you guys have? I don't answer. He goes back to th car and pocks around a bit more then comes back over. "Look I'm going to be strait with you, If you give us the rest of your marijuana we will destroy it and let you guys leave with nothing but a ticket for driving without a license. I am serously conflicted, he is either a decent person who realizes we are just dumb kids and he has better shit to deal with or he is an evil pig and wants me to self incriminate so they can better press charges latter. I figure that at this point I am already in trouble for pipes and the weed in the pipe so I go for it. I still don't know how I decided other than to say it felt like he was legit. I tell him where my nugs are stashed in the car and he goes and grabs them and drops them in his bag of pipes. The female cop then exits the van and walks me over to my car and tells me she is going to remove my handcuffs. I sign the ticket for driving with out ID on you (A jail-able criminal offense in AZ just as a heads up) and lets us drive off into the night, after telling us it would be a good idea if we left phoenix. We drive back up to flagstaff, arrive around 2 a.m. (when they stop selling alcohol round here), on a hunch I decide to call this random Japanese guy who gave me his number and we get invited to a party and a friend of a friend's house. We get there and tell them of our adventures. One kid drives back to his house to get his weed and brings i back just so we could smoke it because the cops took all ours, he didn't even smoke with us. So we ended up getting drunk and high with a bunch of Asians and had a great end to an otherwise not so great day. I really, really hope those cops hot-boxed their van with my weed because both sacks were really good, but the older on was perfect. I would hate for those choice trees to be waisted. Those Asian kids were all super nice, really awesome people. I also got the charges for the license dropped since it was clear that I had lost my wallet hundreds of miles from home.Summary:
Summarize: Being depressed is a really awful thing. You shut down and stop being so outgoing. If you're already an introvert people don't notice what has happened because its a series of really small changes to your lifestyle. But that's the key. No one notices. And that nasty little voice starts echoing in the back of your mind and you recognize it. But by now you're trapped. you've forgotten how to live without depression and you begin sabotaging your own attempts to beat it. Your failures are the only thing that echo in your mind. "You're worthless" you tell yourself, "You can't succeed at anything." Your hobbies and passions lose their luster and stop being enjoyable. You're filled with despair and crippling sense of loss and defeat with no way out.Summary:

Summarize: TIL that vaping is like drinking. Tank juices are like beer and dripping juices are like wine or fine spirits. Both get the job done but to enjoy dripping juices, like fine spirits, you need to do it right. Wine from a wine glass, cognac from a snifter, and dripping with the right coil setup for drippers. I was wrong to abuse the mindset that a drip juice will taste the same from a crappy coil build as from a good build. Today I replaced my hastily assembled 1.0 ohm dual coil build with a nicely done .2 dual coil build. Grabbed the derailed and tossed in as it was the first juice I grabbed out of the bag and hesitantly juiced it up. I was sure I was in for an upset, I had grown tired of its almost perfumey taste and was about to vape it forward but something happened. In my presumption that a juice would taste the same regardless of the coil build, I was happily proved wrong. I thought I enjoyed gourmet(read complex) juices until I realized that the right setup is just as important as the right juice. I am friends again with my derailed thanks to a good sub ohm build.Summary:
Summarize: So basically if you told me last year that I would throw away my social life for video games I would punch you in the dick and get the whole 200 kids that went to my school to come laugh at you. I am 14 years old and live in a small town in Ontario of like 5000 people, and basically everyone plays hockey. Of course I was one of those kids and TBH I was one of the better hockey players out there which of course put me on the popularity charts. I was the star of my old school, but it only goes up to grade 6, so after that we move up to "the big school on the hill." It's not a big deal because everybody knows everybody no matter what school you went to so that means that everyone knew I was no force to be triffled with. The end of grade 7 was when I started playing lots of computer. There was this kid in my class who didn't go to my old school and I had no idea who he was so I started talking to him and he was actually really smart. We both found out we play computer games (I only really played minecraft with . who wanted to play with me before) but then he introduced me to Steam. It was wonderful! All these games!! Me and this kid I had never talked to in my life all of the sudden became bestest of friends through the computer. Everybody else thought he was a nerd and thought the only real video game out there was CoD. One day me and this boy were looking through steam to find any Co - op games that we could play for free because we were both broke and we stumbled upon Dota 2. I never played any sort of MMO or MOBA or anything with wizards and warlock and what not. I remember my first game like it was yesterday. I thought that the person I picked would be my permanent character and I had to chose wisely, so I clicked the random button. I was Bristleback. The hedgehog? I wasn't really satisfied with my pick but whatever I entered the game. We were radiant but that didn't matter because I didn't know either sides of the map. We had to buy items and I thought that what ever item we bought would like cosmetically change my character so I bought some boots. I'm not really sure how the game went and I actually didn't really like it that much so I unistalled it so I could play a different game on my computer (it's really shitty and has no memory). It sat in my steam library still and after watching many YouTube videos, I decided I'd give it another shot. (TY Purge) I was actually pretty decent at the game thanks the Purge but I still new nothing about the game or that there was a pro scene and people actually make money off of it. By that point I had spent way to much time inside and I had ditched to many sleepovers playing Dota so slowly but surely I sank far from the top of my school, which I now give 0 shits about. After learning that Arteezy is only 18 and from Canada (not meaning to make this an EG fan boy post) I knew that I could actually have a shot playing Dota. If you can't tell I am really bad at English and I suck at telling stories (unless I am making excuses) please ask me anything you want to know or I left out.Summary:
Summarize: I went to work sweating rum from the night before once. One of the worst hangovers of my life. I was working at a big drugstore at the time and my boss took one look at me and put me the warehouse until I could get the "oh god, gonne die soon, gonna vomit sooner" look off my face. We'd just filled up a baler (the machine used to crush cardboard boxes, turning them into a a cube weighing several hundred pounds) so I had to wrap the bale and get it out. To do this you take thick wires and thread them through slots in the baler then tie them off in the back. As the cardboard tries to expand it puts a lot of tension into the line. Somehow my dumbass managed to cross the slots on not one by two of the wires so when the lift came up the cube became attached to the back of the baler. My manager and I tried to get the head back down to compress it again and let us untie it, but the preasure snapped the wires (we kind of expected this and had everyone well cleared). Suddenly a week's worth of cardboard exploaded out into the warehouse. We're talking a cascade that left about a quarter of the warehouse in cardboard up to your shin. My manager and I go way back, he just looks at me with this defeated look and says, "Go the fuck home."Summary:

Summarize: background: i am 17 andmy parents dont know i smoke so i have to keep my smoking a secret, but they are fully aware of my brothers smoking habits though) I was coming home from smoking at my girlfriends, i was at a 6. when i came home my mom was downstairs waiting for me which seemed kind of odd. i said hi and tried to act normal. after a brief coversation she went into the kitchen and asked me to follow. when we went in the kitchen my favorite pipe "spyro" was sitting on the counter and i knew i was fucked. i tried to act like i couldnt tell while my mind raced for an explanation. i quickly said my brother had left it in his room and i was holding it for him (he lives about an hour away at my dads house) which she didnt believe. i didnt back down though and stuck to my story. i went upstairs to confront my stepdad and tell him my story. he then said he didnt believe me and pulled out a bowl that i must have left in my hiding spot and forgot about. so then i start to think that im fucked again. i told them that it was my brothers as well and i was planning on throwing it away but i was too sketched to transport it through the house. (to this day my stepdad still doesnt believe me). my brother worked the nightshift so there was a good chance that he was working at that time but my mom decided to call him. i then for the third time thought i was fucked. thankfully he didnt pick up so i sent him a text telling him to go with whatever they say. but me stepdad picked up on me texting and put two and two together so i tried deleting the message before he looked at my phone. so now for the 4th time i thought i was fucked. but the gods shined upon me and the messages finished erasing right as he took my phone. in the morning my brother called my mom back and took credit for the pipe and said he didnt remember leaving the weed there but it was probably his. i owed him big time and later smoked him out for helping me and now my parents trust in me has been slowly restored.Summary:
Summarize: The simple solution is ditch the car payment. It's a myth that older, paid for in cash cars are less dependable that new ones and that what you save in payments you pay for in repairs. Until last summer I drove a 91 Subaru 160 miles a day commuting. In the 5 years I had it, it failed to get me to or home from work 3 times and I spend a total of 800 in failure repairs over that 5 years. Yes there were other maintenance costs, but I would have had those on a new car too. Over the course of owning that car, the cost of ownership(not the cost to run it) was 1.4 cents a mile. Any car that one is making payments on is going to be in the 15 to cents a mile range, just to own it.Summary:
Summarize: Honest to god, Mark Henry during that mid-2000s, red singlet, pre-Hall of Pain, Kool-Aid Man phase. I remember being like 14 and channel surfing past Smackdown in time to see him in some random throwaway squash where he no-sold all of Chavo Guerrero's shit and World's Strongestly Slammed him to death. It might have been part of the Chavo/Hornswoggle feud. I didn't know anything about wrestling at this point, I just remember thinking, "wow, that dude with the dreads is badass." It was funny to me how clearly out of his depth Chavo was.Summary:
Summarize: At first I thought I was a normal kid but then a parcel was delivered to my house. I did not know what type of parcel it could be because I did not order any parcels. By the way it was delivered by an Amazon drone which was euphoric because it droned the shit out of me. Then I opened the parcel and there was a fedora in it, a nice black fedora. I put it on my head and hoped my penis would grow but instead of the growth of my penis my autism was triggered. I have not been the same ever since.Summary:
Summarize: I write a lot of library code and I can't say I've ever had a problem with this. You generally have a pretty good feel for what methods need to be virtual when you're writing the base class anyway (assuming you take the time to think that part through). About the only time I find myself needing to go back and make something virtual in a base class is when the functionality of that class is being seriously reworked.Summary:
Summarize: Sure, if you're comfortable completely ignoring the reason that meaning should be preserved in communication, lest the language be used against us by tyrants who wish to oppress us. This video, and the attitude that spawns these spurious and wholly misdirected arguments against clarity in communication, fosters its own egoism and smugness. Prescriptivism is dead, no doubt, but that doesn't entitle every moronic asshat on the internet to participate in the devolution of the language. [Not all change is good, my friend.

Summarize: A quasi manager at a callcenter I'd worked at needed the phone number of a fellow employee, my ex. I'm lazy so I threw the ex on the to: field so I could type the number without having to remember it. I also included a statement to not inform her where he got the number from because she was being an unruly bitch. I forgot to delete her from the to: field.Summary:

Summarize: I initially posted this to /relationship_advice but wasn‘t getting any responses, and noticed this is a much more active sub. I‘m sorry if anything is weird or seems irrelevant, but I‘m just trying to get everything out in the ope. I (23F) have been with my SO(24M) for over 6 years As long as I‘d known him he‘s been the type to go through short, intense bouts of depression where he will be very worked up feeling that he is worthless, and doesn‘t deserve to be happy and should just do everyone a favour and kill himself. He has laid in bed, holding me, crying and saying that there is so much wrong with him. Through this I have been patient, and supportive of him, trying my best to encourage him to get help- however, he is very reluctant to get any help or even admit that there is a problem. His reasoning varies from ‘I don‘t deserve help, I‘m useless anyways‘ to flat out denying his behaviour, later laughing it off and saying things like ‘what are you talking It has always been a point of frustration in our relationship, but I‘ve always loved him regardless and I would never consider his depression a deal However, lately I‘ve been feeling very ahedonic and restless and just generally unhappy (started about 9 months ago when I started on Nuvaring with really intense depressive/suicidal symptoms. I took myself off Nuvaring, started being active again and changed my diet up and it helped for a while and for the most part. Right now I‘ve just been sort‘ve restless and unsatisfied with my life and most things in it. I guess where I‘d like some advice/help is that my bored/unhappy restlessness has been affecting my SO, he feels like it‘s his problem that I am not happy when we‘re together. I love him more than anything else in my life and would like to marry him some day but I really don‘t think I can be in a relationship with him anymore until we both figure out how to be happy. As my long blurb about him may have implied, he‘s always been sort of emotionally dependant on me (only once has he opened up about his issues to anyone but me) which I‘ve known is an issue and I‘ve somewhat enabled by Lately I‘ve noticed I‘ve been more emotionally dependant on him (and others) lately, sending him texts that are not much more than saying that I‘m sad and lonely and when he doesn‘t respond right away I just become more upset/feel lonelier, but I know it isn‘t fair for me to expect an immediate reply, or a response that‘s just an emotional pat on the head. I really don‘t think this relationship is healthy for either of us right now, but I‘m not sure how to fix it nor how he‘d handle time apart.Summary:
Summarize: Hey guys! I'm currently in a fairly early Naga Transmuter of Cheibriados and I had a couple of questions since I know how easy it is to fuck up and die with a build like this. The Man : My main question is, how/should I go about getting into better armor? One of the main reasons I picked Chei is for the stat boosts in getting my utility spells online and being able to wear heavy armor while maintaining good EV/spell success. My armor skill is 12.5. How much higher does it need to go to mitigate the unarmed penalties? My main form of attack is blade hands right now, and I feel like having low attack delay and higher EV is better than having high AC/high attack delay. Also, how high should my unarmed be for reasonable attack delay with blade hands especially with plate armor? Also I really want some good armor because I have 10 scrolls of enchant armor, so I can make myself some incredible armor. I was planning on purchasing plate armor of fire resistance from Orc 4 and enchanting it to peak condition. That said, should I save a few (lets say 3) scrolls in case I skin a dragon or two in the vaults? The Plan : The second question I have is, where now? I have access to ignite poison (harder to cast in heavy armor but it's down to 21% in my artefact leather armor, keep in mind this is with 0 in fire) and I can get that online pretty easy. That said, my main offense is blade hands, and casting is harder with swords for arms. It is worth spamming ignite poison in Snake Pits before switching to Blade Hands? I don't have it purchased yet, but I do have access to an amulet of clarity for sirens and repel missles for projectiles, but I'm a bit worried about the shoals. Sirens suck when they skirt away from you, and I don't know if my spit poison will be able to get them before I get drowned by souls. Merfolk I'm fine with, I figure I can just temporal disturbance them until they get within blade hands range, but sirens move away from you. Also, I'm worried about movement in shoals. Flight has historically been my go to movement plan, but it is basically worthless to me since I move so damned slow flight runs out after 4-5 tiles of movement. I'm also a bit worried about the tide. I know this is pretty early into a run, but this type of build takes a lot of experience and skill (probably more than I have) but it's very powerful and unique and I don't want to muck it up. Thanks in advance!Summary:
Summarize: This sounds counter-intuitive, but helped me stop biting my nails after almost 20 years. Start by biting only your left (or right) Whenever you feel the urge just bite the fingers on that one hand. With time the other hand's nails will grow. Then slowly lower the number of fingers on your biting hand that you are allowed to bite. Eventually having a shorter nail will feel more out of place than a longer nail.Summary:
Summarize: Alright. I know I'm late to the party, but here's the story: So I'm interested in this girl I've known for a long time now, and she's single for the first time in awhile. (Just got out of a three year relationship about a month ago) We see a movie, I pay, she says we can go back to her place and watch a scary movie. We do, cuddle a little, then end up talking until 7:30am. Turns out she doesn't have a bed at her moms (she was watching her pets), so I sleep on the couch. I see her a few days later on her birthday, we watch a movie, cuddle, I kiss her goodnight. Gooddate.jpg. right? Now she seems incredibly disinterested and distant, despite inviting me back to her place after our first date. She also had mentioned that if she had had a bed there, I could have slept in it. She also invited me to stay the night of said first date. But now, she's having none of it, and as far as I can tell, we both had a super lovely time on each date.Summary:
Summarize: Hells yeah. Why not? It's your opportunity to study kung-fu for fifty years as a Buddhist monk, then come back and start that software company you always to found. Once it floats on the stock market, you could go train to climb the Seven Summits, even if it takes another 30 years. You could also finally visit every museum and actually look at every piece of artwork. Essentially I see it as being able to live a shit tonne different lives, like the multiverse but in a linear fashion (The physicists are going to kill me).Summary:

HP/Valve said we would get silencers back when we were in beta. So, who knows if we will get them tomorrow, or in nineteen hundred years. And even then, we may or may not have to engage in some holy warfare/war crimes.Summary:
Summarize: I'm a guy of slightly larger than the "average" genital size (~6.5-7" length, 4.5" - 5" circumference)going by wiki , but just a bit over. The smallest porn star would easily put me to shame. Even so, if I wear standard-sized condoms my bits get so constricted width-wise that I can only wear them for a short time without being in real pain. They almost act like a cock-ring(keeping all the blood inside and keeping me erect even after intercourse) but a cock-ring that is too small. I've tried trojan/durex/lifestyles and just about any other brand of regular sized condoms I can find in stores. The only couple I've tried that actually seem to fit properly are Trojan Magnum, lifestyles "XL", or lifestyles SKYN "XL" I think they are called. Buying them has problems too because of the stereotypical person that buys a magnum condom (the usually young, immature type that wants to show everyone he has a big dick, sharing it on facebook and anywhere else he can post a picture). Even in the military I think it was they had to reissue condoms with sizes renamed because the soldiers would only take magnum-sized condoms when passed out for free which lead to the magnums running out and no one taking the regulars. There is also a great deal of hate both off and on the internet for anyone buying magnums b/c hate the above-mentioned stereotypical buyer and people feel the standard size fits all because condoms can stretch. Well, yes, they might stretch if you apply some real force to them, but they don't stretch like that simply by putting them on your penis. Does anyone else have this particular problem? Are there condoms out there that are just a bit wider without me needing to buy the less-than-modest Magnum packaging?Summary:
Summarize: I read a lot of posts that disagree with this ("it's just calories in calories out"), so I wanted an explanation. I think it's a lot more complex than calories in calories out. I thought that our hormones (e.g. leptin) naturally regulate how much fat we carry. These hormones will naturally take us to our preferred level or body fat (say 10% for the average guy). If we overeat and get to 11%, natural feedback mechanisms will engage and our appetite will be suppressed (or we will burn calories via exercise, the other side of the equation). We get fat when the hormones aren't working properly and the body fat set point is set higher. I mean fat people usually don't gain weight forever. They usually get fat (say 250lbs), and then stay at that weight for a long time. This is because the body wants to stay at that weight (their leptin and other hormones are messed up). So why would our hormones not be firing right and and make us fatter? From what I read I see 3 culprits: sugar, omega-6 fatty acids and grains. I would love to hear any other opinions. Thanks!Summary:
Summarize: So I started growing a manly full beard back in November just because I've never done it before. My lovely wife tolerated it but has expressed her increasing displeasure in little ways since then (think Family Guy with the birds living in Peters beard reference). Finally came to a head with the statement "I hate your beard, no Sex until you shave it" and "Enjoy your Masterbation!" So where do we go from here Reddit? Is it wrong for her to withhold the Sexy Time because she doesn't find me attractive with a full beard or am I being stubborn, pigheaded, and insensitive to her feelings? Also what are your best Marriage Mexican Standoff story and how was it resolved?Summary:
Summarize: Freshman year- My Gf and I had been out most if the night at a friends apartment making weed butter and then a bunch of edibles. Between all the butter that had gotten on us while we cooked and all the edibles we ate we are both sky high. We get back to my on campus apartment, nobody's home. My three roommates all stumble in loudly about 30 mins later drunk as hell, they had been a some party. We are sharing the stories of our nights when we suddenly hear a shriek from outside. We are all fucked up so none of us really react until we hear a girl running down our hall screaming "help help!" Me and my four roommates all rush outside, my gf and a couple other girls stay behind in the room. We get in the hall and this panicked girl is just sayin"upstairs upstairs please you guys have to do help!" We are all way too fucked up to know what to do so we all just bolt for the stairs and run up to the third floor. We throw open the door to the hall to just see the walls covered in blood. Like fucking everywhere in HUGE streaks across the walls and big semi-soaked in puddles on the carpet. Despite being high as shit I am the most sober one of the four of us so i took the lead and ran towards this writhing body on the ground, then notice there is a girl crying hysterically nearbye and some shirtless dude holding her. This kid we all knew is just in a heap on the floor, he has this massive gash on his head that is just hemorrhaging blood and there is this huge rock like two feet to his left covered in blood. So I grab the kid and using what training I can remember while I'm so fucked up my roommates and I try to to talk to him and carefully rolled him onto his back. Although the whole time he keeps trying to sit up and grab at the rock while making this just like guttural moan. " Jack (not his real name) what's going on?" "Unnnnnggggg" "Jack come on dude speak to me what the fuck happened." "Unnnnngggggg" roommates:"Steve what do we do?!?" "Shit, well if he can't communicate we don't have a choice call 911" (bear in mind we all liked this kid and new that if we called the paramedics and cops this would be it for him at school) roommates look at me hesitantly but say" alright FUCK" So roommate A runs off to call for help while B,C, and I try to piece together what's happening while stopping the blood from gushing out of jacks head. Shirtless dude" we were watching a movie and suddenly we hear a knock on the door, Girl went to answer it and as soon as she opened the door this crazy fucker just decked her in the face!" Although he didn't elaborate more we were never sure how much of the damage on jacks body was dealt by shirtless guy but I have no doubt it was more than a little. While he is telling this to roommate C I am looking jack over and that's when I look in his eyes to see they were dark red and had pupils the size of dimes" FUCKING SHIT! He's high out of his god damned mind!" Turns out elsewhere on campus earlier that night jack had eaten several candies laced with LSD and was tripping his balls off. So anyway at around that point two cops, one of which I had a bit of a history with suddenly burst into the hallway guns drawn. We all throw our hands up as we are being aimed at and so jacks head starts gushing more blood. "What the fuck is going on?!" Dick cop yells "Don't shoot! We found him like this, he needs attention now! Also I think he's on drugs because he is completely nonresponsive, and keeps trying to hit himself with that rock!" I shouted gesturing to the big bloody stone. The cops thankfully lowered their guns and holstered them but then dick cop pulls out his taser and starts threatening jack with it ordering him to get down and comply or be tased. Roommates B,C,and Start yelling" No STOP! He doesn't understand what your saying let us just hold him down he's fine he just needs medical attention!" "Back away from him NOW!" So we all stood up, pretty well covered in blood, and did as he said. Jack pulled himself towards the wall and leaned against it but roommate B grabbed the rock and moved it away from Jack, who still kept reaching for it and the cop kept threatening to taze him if he kept moving, not that jack understood. Eventually the paramedics arrived and carted away Jack, and treat the girl who got a huge black eye. Never heard from jack again personally but B did and he said that according to Jack he had no recollection of how he wound up in our building or why he punched the Girl, but that he kept hitting himself with the rock because he saw it as his brain and was scared if he didn't get it back into his head he would die. So ya that was the craziest thing I saw in college although I do have some other good stories as well. Always remember kids, drugs can be fun, but they can also be very very VERY dangerous.

Summarize: Cloth armor + 5 hp pots will give you much better early sustain than regrowth pendant. Look at it this way: 5 pots = 5 x 150HP = 750HP total. Regrowth pendant is 15HP/5sec. 750 / 15 = 50, so you need 50 ticks for it to give you as much HP as 5 pots would. 50 ticks = 250 seconds (or 4:10). In other words, you would need to spend over four minutes out of base from when you first begin your jungle (at ~1:55) before a regrowth pendant will return more health than you would get from 5 HP pots. Realistically, you'll actually last longer with pots/cloth because the additional armor reduces damage taken (but I'm too lazy for that math). So regrowth will only give you more health back if you stay out of base past the six minute marker (1:55 start-time + 4:10). Now, bear in mind that a full clear takes around 3:30 . Your blue buff will expire at around 4:30, your red buff will expire at around 5:30. By that time you should either A) attempted another gank, or B) gone back to base to buy. Either way, it's very unlikely that you'll find yourself at the 6min mark, with both of your buffs expired, without needing to go back and buy.Summary:
Summarize: EMT here, If you're in a car crash, you shouldn't be getting out of your seat unless the car is going to explode. Not to mention, your doors are most likely going to be jammed shut if you've hit hard enough to risk an explosion. Unless you know what you're doing, don't touch someone who's been injured.Summary:
Summarize: Sure... The G35 is rear wheel drive, that is pretty major on to itself. It looks nicer, drives nicer, and is a higher "class" car than a boy racer civic. In terms of performance, the 3.5L v6 will make more torque and horsepower, than the civic. The rear wheel drive layout will handle more power than the civic, which will just torque steer all over the place if you try to run a bunch of power. It also corners better than the civic, and once modified, it is a faster car in all respects than the civic.Summary:
Summarize: My girlfriend caught me staring at what seemed to be a girls ass at the bar. I had been waiting a long time to get the beer I was going to nurse for the rest of the night, In my boredom my eyes wandered, not lustfully, but curiously. I found myself staring at the tramp stamp of a princess jasmine costumed inseucurasaurus. One of my favorite movies was Aladin, because you know, there's nothing more inspiring than magic, princesses, and the notion that the only way to elevate oneself from poverty is finding a magic lamp. I have three wishes? Funny how that fantasy always follows the phrase "I want" not need but "want". I think the really hard part is trying to find the biggest hook to keep myself from realizing that i'm in an endless loop. The very fact that the Pronoun I is used seems to cement this argument with fallacy. That being said, can any logical thought that proceeds the word "I" be considered anything short of completely Narcissistic? I saw a girl dressed in a thin turquoise piece of fabric. The only thing left to the imagination was what she looked like before she started favoring hookups over sit-ups. I don't know if it was the one too many pity pounds packed on from that bad break up, you know, the one that that had her grazing the glazed donuts at the grocery, wishing the underachieving, pimple nosed cashier would paint her life 50 more or so shades of gray. , or the tramp stamp so subtly covering the entire bottom of her back, like a runway into the limitless depths of some abyss, She got my attention, but she was no princess. But she demanded attention, everything about it screamed "I'm important!" There's that I again, we all want things. Unfortunately I am not drunk enough to waste one of my wishes to portray myself as some prince, Quidich broom in hand, to sweep you off your feet and save you from the perils of the middle class! No, I would rather not focus on the things that beg for attention. I like jellyfish, there's one species in particular that's called the "immortal jellyfish" because it can perpetually revert back to its child state, and theoretically live for thousands of years. Jellyfish don't care about that though. Jellyfish just rides the tide, no room for I's me's my's or why's and it gets immortality. I just want this hangover to go away.Summary:
Summarize: Every year since about the 6th grade, i've gone to our little town fair. It use to be in the mall parking lot, huge, well kept, polite staff and always busy for the week or so it was here. But the last 2 years it's been rather small and kinda shady, rude staff, moved to a smaller empty lot behind our local outback. This year my boyfriend took me, as a little I'm sorry were not going to prom. We're walking around for a little while, it's still pretty early in the day so it seems mostly like little kids and their parents are there. Him and I decide we're going to ride the bull, something I've done quiet a few times growing up going to rodeos. This was his first time, I paid for him and begged him to do it with me, I explain what he has to do, how he cant hold it with two hands and what not, and he does well for his first time, on for about 15 seconds at full speed and shaking. Now it's my turn, I hop on and ride with no issue, I'm wearing skinny jeans so i'm not entirely shocked when I get a wolf whistle about the little bit of lace that got flashed on one turn around, thinking it was my boyfriend. I get off and walk back up to him, dizzy, and a carny comes up and tell's me I was one of the longest riders in this town. I quickly thank him and give a big proud smile holding on to my boyfriend. He quickly pulls me away to the carousel and leans down to kiss me, and I stand up on my tip toes to reach. The same carny apparently works this ride, comes up to us and in the most sarcastic tone possible goes "Aw aren't you cute" keep in mind, this guy is probably about 30, and smells like weed, mixed with fair food. He looks at my boy friend and goes "But maybe she deserves someone a little better fit for her, or at least know's how to ride a bull." I pull my boyfriend out of line, pissed off and grossed out. He tells me well go back when that guys not there, we walk around some more and get some treats and ride some other things. Probably about an hour later we head back to the carousel, i'm carrying my big stuffed koala bear and we get back in line. No sign of creepy carny, we get our wrist bands scanned and get on. I sit on the outside while my boyfriend sits on the middle horse. Rides going, and suddenly creepy carny is back, he hops on quickly, and holds onto the pole my horse is attached to. He just stares at me for a bit until I go "can I help you?" My boyfriend is watching slightly amused, i'm not something to be messed with and he knows as much. The carny looks at me gross yellow teeth stretched out in a grin and goes "Yeah how bout you show me some more of that lace and i'll get you a bigger bear than that sad thing." I'm completely disgusted and creeped out. I tell him to fuck off before I call the cops, but he's not getting the message, until the ride stops and my boyfriend stands up. He towers over this guy and goes "she said fuck off, or i'll have the cops here in two minutes." Creppy carny buggers off and follows around the rest of the night, until i'm so freaked out we have to leave.Summary:
Summarize: After trying nofap for 11 months, I achieved my longest streak of 90 days before relapsing today. Yes, 90 days ago I broke a streak of about 30 days, and I was so horny that I thought it a good idea to practice the dirty dirty with a bag of marshmallows. After an exceptionally sticky clean up, I resolved myself to continue nofap. I was reminded of why I really wanted to continue with this amazing journey. I won't try to drag out my backstory - I guess this post is my testimony. I was introduced to porn at the age of seven. I was living abroad in Europe, and my brother and I would watch porn on TV. I was so young, but I can't imagine the damage I was doing to my young mind. I never got off to it, but I still remember those images to this day. Fast forward to a young Emelcee3 filled with teenage angst and hormones and I rediscovered porn at the age of 12. Like many of you, I was addicted, masturbating at least once on the daily for 10 years. I never realized that porn was a problem for me, until when I was nearing the end of 2014, I experienced ED with a one-night-stand prospect, twice . It was awful, and it absolutely wrecked my confidence. Now I've always prided myself in being a people person, but this instance of sexual failure really messed with me. I remember yelling, "GOD DAMN IT PENIS, WHAT THE SHIT." Fast forward to February where I discovered Nofap through an askreddit thread about something or other. I came to the conclusion that this is what I needed in my life, but at this stage in nofap I was doing it only for what I determined was PIED. After the initial discovery of "superpowers" (placebo or not), I saw the light, as many of you have, and decided that nofap was for me. I was not able to hit a streak of over 20 days until that fateful month that ended with me making one utterly vile smore with my life essence. Fast forward once again to today. I achieved my longest streak of 90 days, experiencing wet dreams occasionally and having sexy time with a classy broad over a one-night-stand. Towards the end I was feeling exceptionally horny, and I was starting to question why I was even doing nofap. I remember seeing a post that encouraged a user to fap to really rediscover why they were doing nofap. I don't recommend this method to everyone, but as I sit here typing this, I am reminded why I am doing nofap in the first place. Here's just a few major points from my 11 months of nofap trials. I don't want to rehash what others have said, but I do want to stress these points. Despite the relapse, I am damn proud of my streak. I am more motivated than ever to continue on and hit a streak double of what I have already achieved. Just because your relapse doesn't mean it's a complete failure and restart. Be proud of what you've achieved. No one is perfect. If it weren't for that post on the askreddit thread plugging nofap, I would have never discovered nofap I'm not saying I would not have discovered it at some other time, but my point is that you never know when plugging this amazing community may help someone struggling with depression and porn. Don't go overboard and come across annoying like an overly zealous preacher, but don't be ashamed to help others discover nofap. While my original nofap motives were soloey for my issues with sex, I have discovered that I want to do nofap to be a better person. Shortly after starting nofap, I made it a point to go to the gym 3-5 times a week. If you are struggling with boredom, depression, and/ or anxiety, I cannot stress enough how wonderful physical activities such as lifting, hiking, running, etc. will be for your mental health, as well as your physique. The gym has become therapy for me, and this is coming from someone who has dealt with true depression and anxiety. Nofap is NOT the miracle problem solver for all of your damn issues, but it can be a wonderful foundation to improve yourself. This is sort of off-topic, but a huge help in me going through life has been reading How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie. This book has helped teach me to be more selfless, learn not to criticize people, and see things from other people's point of view. It is astounding how helpful this has been in my interactions with friends, classmates, coworkers, and family. Go read it. Rick & Morty is the shit. Good lord I love this show - does anyone else have an obsession with it?? Ok /r/nofap, I'm getting offtrack but...Summary:
Summarize: I know it's wrong of me, and I feel really guilty and I'm incredibly embarrassed at myself. So, here's the story. I've been dating my boyfriend(22m) since early August of 2013. He's the most amazing guy I know, and I fully trusted him, for a while. We've had kind of a rocky relationship, and we've been a little on and off, never off for too long though. He's a bit of a relationshipophobe(excuse my lack of a better word) and the whole concept of love is a little foreign to him, and it's been kind of hard on our relationship. So, back in July of 2014, he asked for an open relationship. We fought about it for a while, and I was pretty hurt by the suggestion. I eventually talked it out with a friend and mentioned to him that I'd be willing to try it if he was willing to be patient with me. This was over text and he responded with something kind of vague and an "I love you" so I was a little confused but just set out like we were in an open relationship. I didn't have contact with other guys during this time, and my dumb insecure brain was like, "yep. he's with someone else right now" and it drove me crazy. So, one day I asked if we could talk, took a deep breath and told him that I hated this open relationship idea and he was like "well...I thought we weren't doing that" so basically I felt like an idiot, I was happy again and we moved on. So then in late August we broke up over a stupid fight, but then we both realized that we needed to kind of get our lives on the right track and maybe it would be best to not have any relationship stress to deal with or shape how we lived our lives. He assured me that I was the only one he wants, and that this wasn't a break up to see what else is out there, but just a break to get it together. Fine, I lived with that. We still saw each other a lot, we were still sleeping together, he was still my best friend. Sometime around November, we decided to get back together because neither of us liked not "officially" being together. Things have been pretty great, but something has felt so wrong to me for kind of a while. I had the opportunity to go through his phone on a few separate occasions. Like an idiot, I did it once. It started off innocently enough until I got towards the older texts. I found texts from this girl, we'll call her Jenna. So, Jenna had wished him a happy birthday, and I scrolled up a little and it all seemed okay but something felt off. So, I went all the way to the top, and it turns out they'd been talking since, you guessed it, July. It started off okay, but she'd asked if I was still around(I had an idea of moving for a little that was more a thought than anything, and it was exciting had I been single, but the idea made us both super sad...or so I thought) and there was talk of her coming over(which I vaguely remember him mentioning after the fact and it sat with me wrong but I let it go because I didn't want to make a psycho-bf scene) and she would say stuff like "I'm just trying to figure you out" and stuff, in the way high school girls used to use that line to ask a guy if he liked her. He seemed pretty faithful at first but then he got flintier as time went on and they talked about coming over and having the house to themselves and stuff. So, finally he asks her when the last time she'd been properly "fucked" was. and she said it had been a while and he asked if she wanted to(in his defense, this was right after he and I broke up...but also right after he assured me that he didn't want anyone else) and she said yes but she was hesitant about him "having" her for the first time and then disappearing or something. so stuff goes on like that for a while, then there's a text from her asking which condoms to get, and he said it didn't matter just get the biggest box there was. (I had seen this box in his room because it was a different brand than the one we used, and I tried to not make a big deal out of it, but I wanted to puke) and then from there on I basically forget the rest because I was so upset. She wished him a happy birthday in November, but I was too upset to really read the rest. So, I have a few questions for you guys. Do I even have a right to be upset about this, I mean I went through his phone, that's almost as bad. How can I move past this, since I read these texts, I've felt sick to my stomach. Should I talk to him about it? How do I even bring up that conversation without making it a fight? I think I would have been able to get over it, had it just been during the "break up" but he'd been talking to her since July...and that bothers me. I don't know what to do here. This is so not the kind of person I am and I hate myself for doing this...but what he was doing wasn't right either. Would he have been honest with me otherwise? After we got back together, we talked about it and we both said that we could have had sex, but we didn't because we wanted each other too much. But now that huge box of condoms is haunting me. I know what I did was wrong and stupid and childish and I, in some ways, deserve what I found. But I'm so scared now.Summary:
Summarize: I disagree. Salary is determined by skill level, field, region, personality, and sometimes luck. The amount of money you save your company only enters into the equation because saving your company a lot of money likely requires a higher degree of SKILL. The amount you save the company is not directly correlated with your salary, nor should it be.Summary:
Summarize: We deliberately left it in for our wedding, because we know our friends are a bunch of smartasses. It was hilarious watching their faces as the urge to object just for the hell of it warred with the desire not to be a dick. They didn't say anything, but not because they didn't want to.Summary:
Summarize: Setting the scene: My high school paid for all the juniors to take the ACT (big ol' fancy test for all you non-americans or americans who don't know tests other than the SAT exist). On the day of testing ONLY the juniors went to school and we got to leave at the end of testing. We had to go through strict security checks, timer marked food/bathroom breaks with no talking, and all our desks were aligned exactly the right distance from each other and taped to mark their spots. You can tell my school didn't want to fuck this up right? Well then there was me. I woke up feeling like SHIT. Like someone beat me and then drenched me in ice water. I felt awful. But I had to go. Since I was dizzy and kind of faint my parents packed me some cookies just in case it was just me having a blood sugar issue. First section goes okay. I keep going from extremely hot to extremely cold but I made it through the section. I retrieve my snacks from the security desk and eat some of the delicious butterscotch cookies. I head back feeling a little better but not a whole lot. Second break rolls around, we have to stay in the room for this one. Our "guardian" says they have to use the restroom so they gathered our booklets and said we could talk quietly until they returned. Everyone gets up and asks me if I feel okay. I do NOT. Final section starts. I am VERY dizzy at this point. I just start filling in answers. I do not care. When we get to the writing section is when the bad thing happens. Five minutes in I get up, completely in autopilot, go to the front of the room, and vomit butterscotch orange disgusting sludge into the trashcan. Next I knew I was being escorted out of the room by two teachers without my glasses, sweater, or anything else I had with me. I had to sit in the office for the rest of the testing time while the principal argued with the official tester about whether or not the group of testers I was part of could get their tests scored because I "ruined" the testing environment. I was crying because I was so sorry. (the tests did end up getting scored, I got a 26 which was the second highest score of my class. Since I got sick and did not finish my school payed for me to take it a second time where I got a 28. I was sick then as well but at least I didn't throw up.)Summary:
Summarize: SPOILER ALERT! I try and get to the movies 10-15 minutes before it actually starts, and by start I mean before the stupid Scotia bank ads, and the annoyingly loud airplane scene, so I usually find myself watching a always out of sync Ciniplex pre-show. However during this pre-show I found myself watching an interview with James Cameron as he talked about the new Terminator film and how well of a job they did, only to hear him talk about how John Connor is going to secretly be the "bad guy" in this film. It wasn't bad enough you played the trailer of old and new Arnie fighting each other spoiling that, you had to go ahead and spoil the plot twist in the movie. I think this is ultimately why I didn't find the movie shocking in any way as all the twists had been either spoiled in a trailer or interview all shown to me before I even watched it. This will probably be the same when I go to watch Ant Man also.Summary:
Summarize: Except the girl who's being fuck-zoned can put the dude in a situation in which he has to ultimately decide whether to date the girl or lose it all. The girl isn't seen as guilty of anything in this situation, just drawing a line in the sand (like you did). When it comes to a guy being friend-zoned the guy can't simply cut off the relationship because they aren't getting what they want, they look like dicks if they cut off the friendship, even if they are doing so to keep their emotional stability in tact (just as the girl was).Summary:
Summarize: That would be great if I could get that. Unfortunately yet again, working in the public sector means guaranteed wage increases, guaranteed pension, while the private sector requires an education and provides neither of those benefits.Summary:
Summarize: My white, male brother was recently rejected from a very prestigious military college a few months back. I felt bad for him since that was his first choice school, but the way my family members/ family friends have tried to comfort him has been pissing me off. Rather than leaving it at "I'm sorry" or "You can always try again next year," it seems like everyone has said some version of "Don't sweat it, it's hard for a white boy to get into school nowadays." I've been wanting to tear my hair out, because while my brother was rejected, I was accepted to that exact same school a few years back. And I worked my ass off to be a good candidate. I did a sport almost every single season (fall, winter, and spring) throughout high school, I held leadership positions in various clubs, I was in many honor societies, I had high SAT scores, and most importantly I networked with the college alumni/ liaisons to try to make sure I was on track. Now, my brother is very smart and would've done well at the school, however, he did not work as hard as I did to get into that school. He's a smart kid, but he never held any leadership positions, he didn't network, and while his SAT scores were fairly good, he didn't score as high as I did. So whenever family/ friends (all of whom knew I had gotten into that particular school) tried comforting my brother by telling him, "It's not your fault, it's just hard for a white boy to get into school," by proxy they're saying, "the only reason your sister got in is because she was a girl." That completely diminishes all the hard work that I did to get in-- not to mention the hard work that other female/ non-white students had to do. Luckily, my brother is smart enough to realize that he should've tried harder, and is getting a jump on reapplying to the school-- which is great because I want my brother to he happy and not give up on what he wants to do. But when we dropped him off that the college he's going to now, my family and I ran into a bunch of other parents whose white sons were also rejected from the military academies and many echoed the sentiment that their sons were rejected soley because they were white males. What kind of lesson is that to teach your son? Yes, sometimes you get passed over for something that you deserve, but that's life-- that happens to everyone. Why pitt your son against other ethnicities and genders?Summary:
Summarize: I'm sure that she thinks that way because I haven't kissed her or had sex with her even when I had chance. I'm pretty confident that if I play it cool, she will show attraction when shes over her ex and this could work out if I properly man up and kiss&sex her. Wow this is some fucked up, unhealthy thinking. Your penis is not fucking magic. She is not a child who needs to experience your beautiful penis to realize how she feels. She's an adult and she flat out told you it was a bad idea. You don't get to force someone into a relationship just because she's single now. She knows if she goes for it now she may lose her best friend, because, surprise, you'd be a rebound and she isn't ready to date. It's not about "manning up" or playing some sort of game with her. I'm going to show you your fucked up thinking - how you think you know better than her and aren't respecting her. >Summary:
Summarize: Had 2 tabs each earlier this night with my gf snd our friend. Went to a park which is located on a hill. The view to the city is amazing. I was laying next to a small(ish) lake. Pelicans, ducks and some other water birds chillin', swimming around there. And the frogs quacking. Holy fuck how trippy it is to hear hundreds or even thousands of frogs quacking simultainiously. I was tripping there for at least 2 hours straight. It was amazing. Finally got home. Had a shower, because it's so damn hot. Got into bed next to my gf. When I suddenly felt sick and had to vomit.(I tend to get really nauseaus indoors). Brushed my teeth and back to bed! My gf soon fell a sleep(she had to wake up 1.5 h later to go to work). So here I am, left alone with my thoughts. The fan in the corner of my room was making this sound. It's quite trippy tbh. I switch it off just to switch it back on 5 minutes later(because it's so damn hot here). Here I am thinking and going through all the apects of this life, my life. When I suddenly come to a conclusion that I have to quit smoking. It was time for my gf to wake up. We snuggled, had sex. I made her some coffee. She had a cigarette and drank her coffee(only the half of it, we have so many cups half full laying around at the place). Off she went. I'm laying in my bed as I write this, and I have to say: I feel fucking amazing! Just something I wanted to share with you guys.Summary:
Summarize: Ok we all know that Madara is Op as hell with may i add, Only one rinnegan. How will he die you may ask? Even Kishimoto (As i recall) said he is having trouble thinking of a way for him to die. I have a theory about how he would die. We all know that Obito when he became "Juubito" Almost lost his mind to the juubi. What if my some shear luck Madara does lose his mind to the Juubi, lets face it Madara with both rinnegan, power to destroy any Jutsu, and a juubi jinchuriki at full power i may add, is just OP, So if he loses his mind it would still be on another level but wouldnt be as godly.Summary:
Summarize: Third wave feminism is terrible, Anita Sarkeesian is a total cunt, and all of this "privilege" is bullshit. People just wanting to have something to be offended at. Mens rights activists are dumbasses as well. All this political correctness is terrible. It's turning everyone into special snowflakes who believe they are oppressed in one way or another.Summary:
Summarize: We've been dating for 6 months now, and a week ago she made a joke towards one of my friends about his relationship. He took offense to this. We have a close circle of friends and this resulted in everyone ganging up on my girlfriend on social media. Threats were made, insults were exchanged etc. It got to the point where I had to confront them about it and lash out at them for their disrespect. She's apologized for the joke but to no avail. My girlfriend has been crying every night over this and four days ago, we met at our favorite restaurant and after 3 hours of crying from both of us; she called it quits. She says it's too negative to be around me due to my friends, how it wouldn't work in the future as we could never get married nor be in the same room along with my friends. To make matters worse, we all go to the same campus. She gave me a long kiss goodbye. Forever. Is there any chance of reconciliation or am I just going to have to give up?Summary:
Summarize: pretext been unhappy for many years. Accepted it. Recently fell in love with another guy. Finally realized I need to make leaving a reality. Husband came in angry... He had this big green pretty twisty blown glass piece. He placed it in the focal point of the living room. I asked what it was and he said he bought it because it reminded him of our wedding. He said "oh, it comes with something too!" and then he slipped his wedding ring on it. "why don't you move to England?" I just sat down and didn't say anything for a bit while he walked around yelling at me, calling me "slut", "whore", "cunt", "bitch", so on and so forth. Asked if I was in love with the guy and I said yeah. Said he was going to stab me to death if he had come home any earlier. Said I was lucky... I kept waiting for the gunshot or knife... Thought for sure he was going to kill me. He was yelling at me and throwing things, put a hole in the door. Snapped my Turtle Beach headset in half so I couldn't speak with him any longer... Came up behind me and smacked me in the back of the head pretty hard... Then he came at me again and held me down by my neck while screaming at me. Came at me again with a rage that scared me but I threw my hands up to protect myself which seemed to stop him. Then he took my phone when I was trying to call my mom and did a factory reset. Then he told me to leave. Now, it's cold and I was just in capri pj's, tank top and no shoes. Tried to put on shoes but he said he bought them so I can't have them. Then said the clothes on my back were his. I said I wasn't taking them off, and my mom had given them to me anyways. He came over and ripped my clothes off... Like, literally ripped them off. He hurt me pretty badly in the process. Then he tried shoving me outside. I was pleading not to but he showed me outside. Completely nude with nothing but my numberless phone. So I dial 911.he unlocks the door. Apologizes for hitting me and stuff... Begs me not to leave. Nobody can come get me right now. Two people tried and their vehicles died on them. He seems truly sorry but I can't stay with someone that did that. I'll be going to my mom's ASAP.Summary:
Summarize: It was kind of a bittersweet meet up honestly. Definitely not anything special or at all what we had discussed, but not exactly a disaster either. I'm not sure how to tell this story so I'm just going to start... My birthday is this month and he had been discussing what he wanted to do for/to me. How he wanted to just make the day all about my pleasure, sort of like the first time we slept together. He told me he got massage oil and and had been telling me he couldn't wait to get his hands on me, to tease me, and to taste me. That he wouldn't let me have his cock until I came for him. On his lips. That plan definitely went out the window. When I walked in he wrapped his arms around me and kissed me. My lips, my ears, my neck, and I was doing the same. Before I knew it he picked me up, my legs were wrapped around him, and he carried me to the desk. My dress was up around my hips and I could feel how hard he was through my thin tights. He pulled each of my legs up to his chest, running his hands the entire length, to remove my shoes as I laid back. I thought he was going to take me right there but we made it to the bed. We barely made it to the bed. He was pulling my tights off and on top of me in seconds. He left my panties on to tease me, letting me feel his hard cock against me. I reached down an pushed my panties aside and with one firm thrust I had all of him. That first moment always feels amazing. I feel so full, so tight around him. He fucked me like that, half of our clothes still on, moaning into my ear and neck, until he came. We relaxed still wrapped up in each other before finally stripping off the rest of our sweaty clothes and having a drink. We had somehow knocked the box of chocolates off the bed and wasted half of them. He laughed about how I ruined his plan and I told him there was still time. As we were talking and laughing and grazing what was left of the candy we we ended up discussing his wife and how jealous she is of one of their single neighbors and an invasion of his privacy that she did recently. I didn't know what to say and half hoped he wasn't making it up because of our communication talk recently (which we came to an agreement on anyway) and half hoped he was because it was a little crazy. Despite that awkward moment he soon had his hands on me again. I was the little spoon and he was caressing my body. Running his fingertips down my side, over my ass, gently kissing the back of my neck and nibbling my shoulder, until his fingers found their way between my thighs. He growled into my ear, mmm, as he does, "you're so wet for me" and I moved my ass against him so he could get inside me. I responded with a soft moan and told him I wanted him. He kept massaging my clit with his figers, his other hand across my chest holding me close, as he slowly but firmly pushed himself into me over and over, sending little waves of pleasure throughout my body. I could hear his breath quicken, even over my own noises, feel it against my neck. I was pushing back against him, my legs trembling, mumbling incoherent "yes"s between moans as he kept his pace. The perfect pace. As I started to cum he forced himself as deep as he could get and held his cock there, his fingers making just the right movements to take me over the edge, the arm over my chest held me tightly as I shook. After enjoying that for a few moments I rolled back against him, throwing a leg on each side, without losing his cock I was riding him backwards. This always makes me laugh a little because it reminds me of the "crab walk" game in elementary school. So, as I can't believe that is sexy, I sat up into reverse cowgirl. He loves looking at my ass and squeezing it and seeing me take him in. After what I believed was a good workout I hopped off and wrapped my mouth around him. I sucked all of my juices off of him. But I could only go so long wothout it and I started riding him again, leaning over to nibble his ears. The way he was grabbing me, the almost grunts I could hear, I knew he wanted it harder so I gave it to him, but before long he had me on my back again, with a pillow underneath me and my legs over his shoulders. He knows I love this, the slow deep thrusts and the way it makes his pelvis rub against my clit. It wasn't long befire my knees were buckling again and he started riding me hard, pushing my body towards the edge of the bed. By the time we finished my head and shoulders were hanging off. We didn't notice this but the clock in the room was an hour ahead so we didn't think we had much time afterward. We layed there relaxing and laughing and snuggling until he got into the shower. I watched him get dressed longingly and he came back to bed. It is always so hard for either of us to leave, and he started teasing me again. He was kissing my neck, which drives me crazy, and I alid his hand between my legs to show him exactly how crazy. Once he felt how badly I wanted him he started using thise fingers. Moaning and writhing he asked "can I make you cum like this?". I had to be honest. The answer was no. No one can, I barely can make it work myself. So he left me like that! All worked up wth no release. . . . . .Summary:
Summarize: I'm 25, female, bisexual. I used to dislike women. I was one of those nerdy tomboy girls. Buried in books, science experiments, and later in a computer. Growing up, I always preferred guys for friends. They were drama-free, objective, not easily distracted in arguments/discussions and knowledgable. They also didn't snigger behind your back for your stupid sleeves and didn't spend all their time talking about crushes. They didn't mind aggressive logic. I liked all of this and secretly disliked girls because they were often shallow, not very persistent when it came to acquiring skills, etc. Except, I also had strong girl crushes. Go figure. Anyway, at some point after I started working fulltime, all this started changing. Increasingly, I find that most guys are incurably shallow. They bitch about losing. They degrade women. They cling to a strange notion of toxic masculinity -- they are terrified of anything that might "emasculate" them (many straight guys I know have difficulty imagining themselves as gay in a hypothetical next birth). They boast about their sexual conquests. They are woefully ignorant and prejudiced about several things related to sex and women. Their band of curiosity is narrow. At the same time, I'm starting to come across more and more cool women. Extremely intelligent, curious, insightful, fair (as in objective and interested in fairness), empathetic, fiercely logical, and so on. Even some of the stupid girls I knew -- not all, but some -- suddenly grew into women with whom I'd gladly be stuck in an abandoned island. What's even worse is this: I've started to believe, more and more, that a man and a woman could never replicate the intensity of the intimacy that can happen between two women. I feel like I can never cut past the fog in a man's mind, and he can never cut past the fog in mine. Men seem so incredibly uninterested in psychological intimacy. Or is it just the ones I've known? (And by psychological intimacy, I do not mean sharing secrets or repeating your life history -- not that anything's wrong with that -- and what I do mean is unfortunately hard to describe...) I've come to believe that women's minds and bodies are much more complex and interesting than men's. There is one more thing. I've always been able to easily brush off the constant male-oriented view of things. Not sexist things, you understand, just things where the writer/speaker assumes you are a straight white male. I'd brush it off and focus on the point of discussion. This is becoming harder and harder. I'm more and more resentful of that way of looking at the world. It's often said/done with no fault at all on the part of the writer/speaker but it still irritates me. Take this short story for example -- Cathedral by Raymond Carver and even that is such a trigger to me. I obsessed over every tiny objectifying/annoying thing he said about his wife. It's not the central point of the story but it's what took over my mind. This is so stupid. I will be handicapped by this because it takes away my objectivity. Now with these diseased eyes, I view every great author with suspicion. All of them seem to assume a male-oriented slightly-female-objectifying view of the world. This wouldn't matter, but I hate that I'm missing out on their great storytelling and writing because of my stupid hangup. Anyway. Wall of text. I'm somewhat ashamed of this. It feels great to finally write it out. Also, I really really hope that I am utterly wrong, and I've just met a strange sequence of people in my life that has led me to this conclusion. Because I like the idea of the world having more interesting people rather than less.Summary:
Summarize: I was in Atlantic City for my friends 21st birthday. He got obliviously drunk so I decided I was going to do my own thing, play the games I want and not deal with him. This is after I told myself that I would NEVER attend another 21st birthday because its the same bullshit over and over. So I bounce and play some craps. Im shooting dice well and I get a call from him, I pick up and he asks "Should I buy coke?" And of course I say "yes" and he tells me to go back to the room. So I run upstairs, run down the hallway, open the door to the room to find my friend and 2 random, thug ass, black dudes with crazy jewelry on. Now these dudes towered myself and my buddy by inches and Im 6 ft tall. So I act cool and buy some blow. I questioned the quality of the blow and their tone of voice became very aggressive and they became very jumpy. The guy holding then took out a credit card and shoveled this coke up my nose. It tasted terrible and was cleary cut with dog shit and didnt get me high, especially with the amount they jammed up my nose. Just to get them out if my face we bought a gram for $60 snd they got out of there. Before they left, they questioned my earrings. I told them they were purchased at Walmart for 12.99, which they were, and he grilled them sooooo hard. I thought he was gonna start robbing us. They would have gotten away with it, too. Then we blew the dawg shit coke, trying to convince ourselves that it wasnt beat. So then my friend locked his wallet in the room lock box, and wasnt able to open it for an hour, due to the fact ge kept putting in the wrong pin code. Thats when I left him alone in the room and I went back to the craps table.Summary:
Summarize: I don't know how I feel about you. Were you tormenting us for views on some GIANTDAD-style video? Or was this you own private hell I entered? One man, no, not a man. One Monster, deep in Aldrich territory, where no lone host should survive, broke us all. I was a lonely Finger, having a fine day collecting tongues for M'lady. I wasn't prepared for this. This thing, with skin that cut and bled us, and dark hands that glowed a pale red, glowing from all the blood on his hands. He was a ball of furious energy, just rolling and rolling and rolling and....... I was not alone in this torment, one of the Faithful was struggling with the beast, and another soon arrived. But this thing just laughed, mocking our attempts to slay it." Very Good " " Very Good " " Very GOOD ". Even together we were more risk to ourselves, such was our blind rage at this abomination, and any glancing blows we could land were washed away under his many restorative estus. Despite his pure evil, many a blue and Darkmoon bastard arrived to aid this foul creature, if you needed Proof to believe they are delusional for their persecution of us. I saw several of the Faithful die or banish themselves to escape this nightmare, but we that remained took our righteous frustrations out on the blues, and I claimed many a forked tongue for M'lady. In the end all the Faithful had resigned, their faith shattered in this cruel test, leaving me to face this monstrosity alone.

Summarize: Slightly Related Story Time: One time in the ninth grade I went to my school dance. I'm not much of a dancer, and I've never been fond of dance music, so I basically hung out with friends the whole time. We decide it's too loud in the cafeteria (where the dance was being held) so we want to walk around the school and continue to talk. Unfortunately, there was a couple sitting on the fucking floor, blocking us from leaving. Some bolder people that wanted to get out stepped over them, which I suggested, but my friends wanted to wait it out because they were a bit socially awkward back then. After fifteen minutes I was getting frustrated. I picked up a glow stick from the floor, walked to secluded spot where the doorway was in view, and whipped it at them. They didn't fucking notice. I found a second glow stick and tried again. Still nothing. My friends and some other people are watching me at this point. I tried a third time and it hit the girl in the ear. She starts screaming and the guy gets up and walks towards me. I was a scrawny kid so I was scared shitless. I couldn't believe that I had such a bad idea. Did I really think that it would work? Anyways, he comes over and screams "DID YOU FUCKING THROW A GLOW STICK AT MY GIRLFRIEND?" I reply, "What are you talking about? I didn't throw anything!" He insists I did. I insist I did not. I ask my friends to vouch for me. They say I didn't do anything. Luckily nobody else that saw me has bothered to speak up. He finally gets frustrated and leaves. Anyways, as time went on I found out that, despite being inconsiderate, he wasn't such a bad guy. At prom I saw him and his girlfriend again and told them that "if they started making out in the doorway I'd find another glow stick to throw at them". They didn't know what I was talking about so I let sleeping beasts lie.Summary:
Summarize: There is no public harm to vaccinated children This is so wrong I'm a bit flabbergasted if I'm being honest. Some people can't get vaccinated due to weakened immune systems and other diseases. Those people rely on what's known as "** herd immunity . Not only that, there are already cases of whooping cough outbreaks. Get this; the number of whooping cough cases in the United States back in 1991 was 2719. Do you know what it was in 2012? Nearly 50,000 . It's a direct result of the anti-vaccination surge that has occurred within this past decade or so. [Source.]( > I think the issue is with the poor and uninsured. The poor get their vaccinations at a significantly reduced cost thanks to obamacare and other other subsidies. In many states, they are free to the poor.Summary:

Summarize: When I was 16 I had sex with my friends mom. At first I was terrified. Losing my virginity to a 32 year old woman and waking up to her daughter yelling. Sheesh. When I got home I counted 18 hickeys from my neck to my chest. Scratched up on my back and arms. My parents noticed a few hours after I had been home. I told them I had did it with my friends cousin. It is just a funny story now. But I freaked out the first couple years. Denying it ever happened. Ruined my friendship. And I never even got to put it in her butt.Summary:
Summarize: Ok, I'm curious what the odds are of getting an 8. I'm pretty awful at math so I got stuck, and probably also made some errors along the way. I know some of you bastards are fiendishly good at this -- can you pick up where I left off, or explain why I was headed in the wrong direction? Ok, so an expert board has 36 * 16 = 576 squares, of which 99 are mined. The odds that a given square on an unexplored board is safe are (576 - 99) / 576 = 53 / 64 The odds that some given neighbor of a clear cell is mined are 99 / 575 (because we have 99 mines and 575 potential places for them -- we know that a mine can't be located on the clear square we're investigating.) Now imagine we have a clear square with one of its neighbors identified as a mine. What are the chances that another given neighbor is also mined? Well, we have 98 mines left, and 574 squares where they could be located, so the odds are 98 / 574. For a clear cell with two specific adjacent cells that are mined, the chance that a given unexplored neighbor is mined is 97 / 573, and so on. So on an unexplored board, the chance that any given cell has eight mined neighbors are: (99 / 575) (98 / 574) (97 / 573) (96 / 572) (95 / 571) (94 / 571) (93 / 570) * (92 / 569) Which can be expressed as: (99! / 91!) * (568! / 575!) The odds that a cell doesn't have eight mined neighbors are therefore 1 - (99! / 91!) * (568! / 575!) = 0.999655... This is where I get stuck, because each cell that is determined to be a non-eight disqualifies a bunch of other cells from possibly being eights (the number of cells it disqualifies depend on whether or not it is located near the edge or not, since edge cells can't be eights anyway), so the possibly that there exists an eight goes down with each explored non-eight, non-mined cell.Summary:
Summarize: I've been doing nofap on and off for quite some time now. Every time I do it I feel so much better but I didn't really understand why. This week I sort of had an epiphany on why it is so effective. Basically, I realized that everything you do is a habit. For me personally, the times I most want to fap are before bedtime and during times of anxiety such as overwhelming social situations or when studying for a big test. Since I had two massive midterms this week, you could imagine I've been fighting the urge quite a bit. But I did not fap. Because I realized something: fapping is the easy way out. If I fap when I become anxious I am only cramming that anxiety into a crowded shelf with my other insecurities until it inevitably falls back off the shelf. It's a temporary fix. If I fap everytime I go to bed, it is the same idea: i'm conditioning my body to only be able to sleep if I get off. But I did not fap. Sure I lost some sleep and I became a little more neurotic than usual, but by accepting the hardships that came with it I realized that there is and empowering and refreshing feeling that comes with being able to control yourself. Accept that it sucks, understand why it sucks, and make the decision to revel in your suffering Without challenge, there is no growth. This applies to so many things in life! If your workouts aren't hard enough, you wont see results. If you're not studying hard enough, you wont get the good grade. If you don't make the conscious effort to change, no change will happen. Smooth seas do not make a skillful sailor. In hindsight this seems like such a simple concept but experiencing this for yourself is something else. It really made NoFap easier for me. Instead of distracting yourself with other activities so you don't fap or taking a cold shower ( not saying these are bad alternatives, just presenting another option) try and face your urges head on. It is enlightening when you can tell yourself "I know this sucks. I really want to fap right now because __ ". It allows you to understand the true root of the problem, and in this realization will come more creative solutions along with that empowering sense of "yes I do have control over myself". Sorry for the long post, thank you to all who read it. Just thought I'd share a little of my thought process with you guys in hopes that it is helpful.Summary:

Summarize: For the longest time, I've been "Only 2D Metroid. They're the only ones I can play." and I've no idea why. I've played through all the 2D games countless times and love them all, but I have this nagging guilt in the back of my mind, that I'm neglecting amazing games, but I can't get into them. This has been going on for years . Then Federation Force came out and I gave it a try, mostly because I wanted to support the series and I actually loved it. Since beating FF, I've wanted to return to Prime, but haven't gotten around to it. However there's one problem I have with this. I absolutely, with unexplained and unbridled rage, fucking hate motion controls. I have a feeling I'll love Prime 1, because I have it on Gamecube. The other two games however, I'd need to buy the trilogy for on the eshop, and I'm left with no choice, trilogy or not, but to use that loathsome cunt of a nunchuck. What do I do? Grin and bear it or what? Because I definitely want to play the series.Summary:
Summarize: Well, you should've learned something about gambling there though. You had an estimated 5% chance of getting D/W Batman and a 10% chance of getting a gold egg. Probability says you SHOULD get a D/W Batman after 20 rolls or 100 stones. Because that's what the average should be. Which is what you're probably banking on. "Well, I should get him by 20 rolls and I should get gold after 10 rolls". Yeah, that's what probability says. That you PROBABLY will get it by 20, and a gold by 10. But you're forgetting the other part of this. That's the average. So if someone has ridiculous luck, someone is going to have shitty luck to counter that. If I pull two D/W Batmans as my first 2 pulls, then someone out there is probably going to pull 38 times and not get him. It's very rare to pull two D/W Batmans as your first two pulls but you see people around that post about their ridiculous luck. For every one of those people with ridiculous luck, you have someone counteracting them with bad luck. With randomness you get winners and you get losers. You just happened to be the loser this time. It's supposed to even out over time but some people will just be luckier than others. Case in point. Rare Evo PEM pulls. I've done more than a friend of mine. I'm probably at like 180+ pulls. My count: 2 Devilit, 2 KoG. He's at just under my number of pulls. His count? 11 Trifruit, 3 KoG, 2 Devilit, 4 Angelits. Or you can just listen to some of the skill up horror stories. Some people feed 5 and get 4 skill ups. Some people have fed 120 and only gotten 3 skill ups or something like that.Summary:
Summarize: Basically, I went to nerd camp over the summer for 3 weeks. Let's call this guy Alex. Alex and I were in the same group (out of 13 people) at camp, which means that we usually saw each other for 6-8 hrs/day. I didn't notice Alex for most of the first week because I thought Alex hated me because I'd always see him staring at me sort of intensely (not in a creepy way. Idk how to describe it). Every day our group usually had "class" (basically a discussion over the topic) so we all sat at one table. The guy who sits next to Alex is hilarious, so he usually cracks jokes and everyone will laugh and I'll smile in his direction. I first started thinking that Alex liked me because whenever I looked over, I'd see him looking directly at me laughing and we'd make eye contact and smile at each other for several seconds. I sit at an angle from him so it's not like he was looking straight ahead naturally. I don't want to give away too much info about what type of camp I went to bc a lot of people there maybe check out this subreddit too, but basically it was more of an academic type of camp and we had to compete against each other individually in rounds. We were split into four groups for our very first practice round, so I watched Alex do his round and I noticed that he kept on looking at the judge and then making eye contact with me. Alex also watched my round but I didn't really pay attention to him. Three days later, I have to compete against Alex and I notice that he was really awkward, shy, and nervous and spoke really fast and quiet. He's normally a super loud, extroverted guy who has no problem talking to girls so I'm not sure if he acted a bit weird because he thought I was good (since he watched my round) or because he liked me. He talked to me a bit after our round and his voice was still soft and kind of awkward and he tried to make a couple of jokes (how his speech was messy, how our judge must have gotten a headache from listening to him). I mainly just smiled and nodded. Later that day at dinner, we're all sitting at the table and I notice him looking in my direction a lot. I drink from a glass of water and I see him drink from his too and we make eye contact for like ~5 seconds. There were a lot more events, but I don't want to bore anyone since it was 3 weeks of camp and this post would never end. It was basically small, subtle hints like that. He and I would usually make eye contact for a couple seconds and I'd always notice that his eye contact was never casual because he'd always look pretty deeply/intensely into my eyes. Whenever he'd make a joke or was goofing off, he'd glance at me me first and even if I was standing behind him and not making any noise, sometimes he'd turn completely around and make eye contact and then turn back. I'm kind of awkward, but one time I was texting him directions in the group chat and I looked up and saw him smiling at me, so he'd usually either intensely stare at me or be already smiling at me when I look at him and make eye contact. At dinner we'd sit across from each other and he never really makes eye contact (he also completely ignores me when we're in small groups), he was on his phone or looking down at his food most of the time. There was this one day where we almost became actual friends--I made a joke and everyone in our group cracked up, Alex made a meme of it and we smiled and waved a lot during that time. He was unnaturally hyper/excited the rest of the day, so I think that was a good sign. I'm really close with one of his friends (let's call him Ethan) and we'd always hang out, so sometimes I think he may have gotten jealous, because I remember one time during morning class Ethan and I were sitting pretty close to one another and he noticed and was in a bad mood for the rest of the day. He was also snappy towards me and not Ethan. One thing that makes me think Alex didn't like me though was because sometimes he'd ignore me for most of the day and he'd never make an effort to do 1-1 conversation, he kind of stayed at a distance and preferred to tease me from across the room when we were all in one big group. I think Alex always treated me differently than other girls, because with other girls at camp he was super outgoing, a bit flirtatious, and could basically talk to anyone. His voice always got quieter and deeper (maybe more nice?) whenever he talked to me and he always seemed awkward. On the last day of camp, we're all playing this truth or dare type of game and someone asks who in the group would make a good couple and someone else answers that Alex and Caroline would (they were sort of friends but it was obvious they friend-zoned each other). Then Alex ends up saying "I have a girlfriend" and we get all of these extra details about her being white, living out of state, and how they talk on Skype. What surprised me is that I didn't really feel that depressed about it, something felt off so I didn't really care. For some reason, he acted a lot friendly to me than usual after saying that that day. At the closing ceremony, he came late and ended up standing really close next to me. I don't think it was significant though because I was standing next to his friends and it was cramped in the auditorium anyway. His friends later move away but I notice that he's still standing just as close to me. When the slideshow is playing, he makes some small comments and I feel like he was probably talking to me, but there may have been our counselor who stood to his left later during the slideshow. As the closing ceremony ends, he and another guy Dan are talking. Dan's my friend and he says he'll miss me since I'm leaving that night, so Alex turns to look at me, stretches out his arm like he wants to pat me on the shoulder (I was standing farther away than expected so he just let his arm drop), smirks and says RIP. Since we're all standing, I kind of move behind them so I can lean against the wall. He watches me as I move and later turns behind him to look at me a couple of times, even though I was the only one there. He also asked me what time it was, but I was holding my phone and he probably noticed, but couldn't he have checked himself or asked his friends next to him? Alex later walks with me and Kyle back to the dorm (doesn't say anything) but doesn't say bye to the rest of our group. It was probably because his flight was leaving super early the next morning. He doesn't say bye but runs up to his room and that's the last time I ever see of him. The next day, I decided "forget it" and we follow each other on Instagram and friend each other on Facebook. I do some light crush stalking and discover that there's no sign of his supposed girlfriend anywhere. She doesn't follow him (or he her), like or comment on his pictures, he doesn't post pics or text of them, and no friends comment or tease him about them. It's like she doesn't exist. So basically, here I am. I think I'm a complete idiot for still liking this guy considering that it's been over a month since I last saw him and we don't talk 1-1 except with others on the group chat and following each other on social media, and also we live a couple thousand miles away from each other. I think I'm still hung up on him because he was my first major crush, he is the first person who I really liked who may have liked me back, and I suspect that him saying he had a girlfriend was probably an excuse for him to get out of an awkward situation. I really didn't handle the situation well at camp because I'm super shy and I tend to be more reserved towards guys I like. I was fine and super outgoing with the other guys in our group but always held back when talking to him and he did the same. So basically, we got nowhere and he probably had no clue I liked him except that I was more nervous around him, talked to him a bit less than other guys, and looked at him back quite a bit. I'd talk to him on social media, but it's awkward because we never really talked at camp or I'm still wary that there's still a chance I overthought all of these encounters and he didn't actually like me and that he may have a girlfriend. What should I do now? Did it seem like he liked me or were the hints too subtle and easily misinterpreted? Maybe he was just uncomfortable around me because I was like a stranger? Am I pathetic?Summary:

Summarize: Hi, I recently have admitted to myself that yes, I have fallen into the trap of liking my best friend. Honestly don't know what I would do without her. Bit of background information on our friendship, skip to the last paragraph if you don't want to read it all. So a bit of background information. For the purpose of ease I shall call my best friend whom I like now, Jill. The two of us met around 4 year's ago when I liked a friend of Jill. Around this time I became close with Jill spending a lot of time with her. I broke up with my girlfriend at the time and stayed friends with Jill. She eventually liked me and I politely declined her and dated another of her friends. The whole time we both stayed best friends and became even closer with her helping me through another two breakups. Soon after Jill began dating a guy two years older than her. Skip forward just over two year's and Jill is still together with the boyfriend, but however in a long distance relationship because he moved to a city that's a two hour plane flight away. Jill and I have stayed best friends the whole time and recently I have realized that I have feelings for her. Jill and her boyfriend show no signs of breaking up anytime soon. I love this girl, we have gone through so much together over the year's. The two of us are so close and I would tear myself apart if we were no longer friends. However if my feelings continue it could well come to that even if I don't want it to. My question's are; How do I get over my feeling's for her? How do I proceed for the time being? I feel like such a fucking idiot getting feelings for her cause I could ruin this friendship which I think is the best thing to ever happen to me and nothing make's me happier than spending time with her. I am really conflicted as to the course of action I should take. I wish to keep the friendship that I have with her.Summary:
Summarize: I wrote this for another thread that was deleted so it's not really "Love at first sight" but more "Like at first sight that later turned into love". The story behind it is a little complicated and, at points, sad. When we met she (Let's call her S) was dating someone else (We'll call him A), but she immediately struck me as the kind of person I wanted to spend time with. We had some mutual friends so I was able to spend time with her through them. After a fairly short while we started talking just the two of us and we became friends in our own right. I liked her almost immediately, but, as I mentioned earlier, she already had a boyfriend so I tried not to think about her in that way, assuming it was never going to happen. At this point it was the summer after my Sophomore year in college and I moved into my own apartment for the summer (I was subletting from a friend). Having the run of the apartment was great and I used it to hang out with my friends who stayed around for the summer, S included. As we spent more time together we grew even closer and it was becoming harder to supress my feelings for her, but I endured. After a while I started dating another girl (K) that I thought I had feelings for, but in retrospect I was probably just trying to cover up my feelings for S. I know, that probably makes me a bad person and I feel bad about it, but she's engaged to someone now so she found a person better for her too. When the next semester started we continued to hang out, but it was just the two of us instead of a whole group, more often than not. She started doing things that made it obvious to me that she liked me, things that were out of her usual character. Things like randomly hugging me from behind or tickling me and other cutsey things like that. This went on for a while until I couldn't ignore it anymore and I confronted her about it. I convinced her to admit she liked me, and then we talked about what we wanted to do. I knew that I didn't have the kind of feelings for K at the time than I did for S, so I was willing to break up with K. S and A, however, had been together much longer than K and I so I knew it wouldn't be as easy for her. She went home to think things over and figure out what she wanted to do. I knew that even if she couldn't break up with A, I at least had to stop toying with K just because I didn't want to admit I didn't like her as much as she did me. I called her and after talking for a short while, we broke up. She didn't see it coming and I felt really bad. My friends later said they could tell I was unhappy with her and that I did the right thing to break up with her. As I mentioned earlier, she's happy now so I don't feel as bad. The next morning S called me and told me that she had broken up with A. We decided to hang out for the day before going to our mutual friend J's birthday hangout and a movie with a bunch of friends. Everything was going relatively well, but I could tell that S was distracted and she went home afterwards. She called me again the next morning and told me that she had gotten back together with A. I wasn't entirely surprised, but it still struck a chord and hurt. She said something along the lines of "It's like I'll always go back to him" which was like a punch to the groin. We didn't hang out much for a couple weeks, but then things started to get back to normal. Over the next few months we hung out a lot, even after she graduated. She started looking for jobs and we talked through the whole thing because she wasn't having much luck. She would hang out with me all day (that I wasn't in class or working) and then went back to him at night. Right before one job interview that she was really excited about, they got into a big fight. Something he started about something stupid that I can't recall. She was really worked up about it, but had to go to the intervew. She ended up getting lost because she hand't had the time to prepare. She was late to the interview and was really mad about the whole thing. That night, she didn't go home to him, but stayed with me instead. We told our friends she slept on the couch, but she didn't. Nothing happened, but it was really nice to have her there with me. Shortly thereafter she broke up with A, for good this time. We waited a few weeks before officially becoming "a couple" to not make it seem like things were going on behind everyone's back the whole time. It is now almost 4 years later and we are finally together after another series of problems involving her job search, moving all over the place, and her stubborn mother. That is another story entirely, however. I'm willing to tell it, too, but only if someone actually cares. Let me know and I'll write a follow-up.Summary:
Summarize: My girlfriend left facebook logged in on my computer. We recently broke up and got back together, with the single period lasting for 2 weeks. I thought it would be funny to send her a message to herself reminding her to log out next time, when I saw that she recently messaged her ex. He has been constantly bothering her, so I wanted to know if he said something that was threatening to her. I accidentally went too far back, and I saw several pictures of them fucking and walls of erotic text, and recently she talked to him about "breaking up with the poor kid." They then talked about his dick, and the conversation dropped. We got back together 3 days after this conversation, when she told me she didn't even think about getting with other guys. I threw up and I can't stop obsessing over it. What the hell do I do?Summary:
Summarize: I know it's wrong of me, and I feel really guilty and I'm incredibly embarrassed at myself. So, here's the story. I've been dating my boyfriend(22m) since early August of 2013. He's the most amazing guy I know, and I fully trusted him, for a while. We've had kind of a rocky relationship, and we've been a little on and off, never off for too long though. He's a bit of a relationshipophobe(excuse my lack of a better word) and the whole concept of love is a little foreign to him, and it's been kind of hard on our relationship. So, back in July of 2014, he asked for an open relationship. We fought about it for a while, and I was pretty hurt by the suggestion. I eventually talked it out with a friend and mentioned to him that I'd be willing to try it if he was willing to be patient with me. This was over text and he responded with something kind of vague and an "I love you" so I was a little confused but just set out like we were in an open relationship. I didn't have contact with other guys during this time, and my dumb insecure brain was like, "yep. he's with someone else right now" and it drove me crazy. So, one day I asked if we could talk, took a deep breath and told him that I hated this open relationship idea and he was like "well...I thought we weren't doing that" so basically I felt like an idiot, I was happy again and we moved on. So then in late August we broke up over a stupid fight, but then we both realized that we needed to kind of get our lives on the right track and maybe it would be best to not have any relationship stress to deal with or shape how we lived our lives. He assured me that I was the only one he wants, and that this wasn't a break up to see what else is out there, but just a break to get it together. Fine, I lived with that. We still saw each other a lot, we were still sleeping together, he was still my best friend. Sometime around November, we decided to get back together because neither of us liked not "officially" being together. Things have been pretty great, but something has felt so wrong to me for kind of a while. I had the opportunity to go through his phone on a few separate occasions. Like an idiot, I did it once. It started off innocently enough until I got towards the older texts. I found texts from this girl, we'll call her Jenna. So, Jenna had wished him a happy birthday, and I scrolled up a little and it all seemed okay but something felt off. So, I went all the way to the top, and it turns out they'd been talking since, you guessed it, July. It started off okay, but she'd asked if I was still around(I had an idea of moving for a little that was more a thought than anything, and it was exciting had I been single, but the idea made us both super sad...or so I thought) and there was talk of her coming over(which I vaguely remember him mentioning after the fact and it sat with me wrong but I let it go because I didn't want to make a psycho-bf scene) and she would say stuff like "I'm just trying to figure you out" and stuff, in the way high school girls used to use that line to ask a guy if he liked her. He seemed pretty faithful at first but then he got flintier as time went on and they talked about coming over and having the house to themselves and stuff. So, finally he asks her when the last time she'd been properly "fucked" was. and she said it had been a while and he asked if she wanted to(in his defense, this was right after he and I broke up...but also right after he assured me that he didn't want anyone else) and she said yes but she was hesitant about him "having" her for the first time and then disappearing or something. so stuff goes on like that for a while, then there's a text from her asking which condoms to get, and he said it didn't matter just get the biggest box there was. (I had seen this box in his room because it was a different brand than the one we used, and I tried to not make a big deal out of it, but I wanted to puke) and then from there on I basically forget the rest because I was so upset. She wished him a happy birthday in November, but I was too upset to really read the rest. So, I have a few questions for you guys. Do I even have a right to be upset about this, I mean I went through his phone, that's almost as bad. How can I move past this, since I read these texts, I've felt sick to my stomach. Should I talk to him about it? How do I even bring up that conversation without making it a fight? I think I would have been able to get over it, had it just been during the "break up" but he'd been talking to her since July...and that bothers me. I don't know what to do here. This is so not the kind of person I am and I hate myself for doing this...but what he was doing wasn't right either. Would he have been honest with me otherwise? After we got back together, we talked about it and we both said that we could have had sex, but we didn't because we wanted each other too much. But now that huge box of condoms is haunting me. I know what I did was wrong and stupid and childish and I, in some ways, deserve what I found. But I'm so scared now.Summary:
Summarize: So, because I feel like others have address the anti-nuclear andi-GMO thing pretty well, I'm going to try to address your anti-new-age-crystal-hippy thing. Someone else in this thread asked "what's the science behind this?" I'm no expert, but in the interest of open mindedness I'll take a crack at it.... I think it goes something like this: -atoms vibrate/oscillate/wiggle around -in the process of all this vibrating, they produce mild electro-magnetic fields -Something hetrogenous like a handful of granola will have somewhat of a random, chaotic field. -something "pure" like a crystal on the other hand, being composed of the same molecule lined up in a precise geometric grid, will produce a comparatively orderly field. -people believe that the energy fields produced by such organized grid of molecules can somehow share/impart that order, that vibration, through resonance or some other mechanism and in so doing have an effect on people, objects, thoughts, etc. Personally, I'm just a geometry/science nerd, and I appreciate minerals for their organization and form. But I'm not one to project properties onto things. I'm into rigorous testing. But since there hasn't been much of that, I'm hesitant to dismiss peoples claims that crystals have this or that property. How the fuck would I know? I just like shapes. It's certainly possible that organized Euclidian grids of molecules could influence other molecules around them and impart their order. But it could be a bunch of wistful thinking. But I certainly wouldn't claim to know enough about it to dismiss another person's thoughts on the subject. I'm no physicist. I generally try not to dismiss peoples thoughts and opinions even if I disagree, because I realize how limited my understanding of the universe is. My personal science experience is tiny. Everything I think I know, I've read, and hope is coming from an honest source. But am I prepared to condemn the thoughts/opinions of others because they've read some things that disagree with the things that I've read? nope. Rather than committing to absolute "Truth", I prefer to have an array of ideas in my awareness, with varying degrees of plausibility. Someone may have a strong belief that I think is impossible, but I've never changed the mind of another by denying that "Truth". The only effective option I've found is to present them with alternative perspectives in a non threatening/aggressive way. If you are gentle and casually persuasive, over time they may come around to being open to your perspective. So, rather than dismissing people you disagree with, learn more about the context of their perspective, and present them with alternate perspectives in a gentle open minded way. So at the end of the discussion they don't feel like "hey, what a rude aggressive douche, he didn't even listen and tried to rape me with his opinion penis". People are far more likely to be open to be open to new perspectives if you can speak to them about their beliefs in a way that they feel you have an in depth understanding of where they are coming from, and that you are presenting an alternative perspective... not as the only true perspective, but simply as new perspective from someone who is looking at the problem from another angle. The science you and I place our trust in is just a general consensus, which has historically been refuted, time and time again. Stay open.Summary:
Summarize: Hello! So... I didn't know where else to ask since my situation is specifically with the United States Air Force. So, I am dating a guy (1.5 years) that very recently decided that the Air Force is what he wants to do to make the change in his life that will make him happier. He is working at Target at the moment and just feels underwhelmed and discontent about his life. He originally wanted to work towards Paramedic and join the National Guard so that he can better help people but I suppose that wasn't enough. SO. Here I am, I am supporting his decision because I want him to be happy and it is an exciting prospect for his life. But, I am a Masters student in my last year of my M.Architecture degree. I am wondering how it goes when someone is in the Air Force and moves a lot that is with someone that also has a career/ not a housewife. I have developed a lot of skills that can lead me to many different jobs around my field and it is my passion so I am not going to give it up either. Is there any hope? I know airmen move around a lot which actually is an awesome idea to me because that's what I want to do in my life. Experience different places. But I know I can't stay with him and it will be difficult sometimes to find a job right away to the different places he goes. So I guess, I'm just looking for personal stories, information, etc.Summary:
Summarize: Hi all, looking for some advice on getting a new bike. I have a Canondale cross bike from 2001 that I ride as a road bike, but its nice to know it can do trails. I really like it. It works well when I go through shit areas. I like taking it to the market and stuff. * I had a road bike for two years that I ended up selling because it didn’t fit or “ride right” (even though it was supposedly the right size) Im starting to ride more/have a better job, so I wanted to upgrade my bike, but its not worth dumping money into a bike from 2001 worth maybe 400 bucks. This led me to start looking for a road bike (and make the Canondale a secondary bike) After all my research and bike porn lust, I settled on a custom steel bike thats probably going to end up running up around 5-6k. uh oh. Pros: It will be awesome, I rode the last bike I loved (the canondale) for over a decade so I don’t feel like its a total waste, it will fit perfectly, it will be dream bike Cons: Its over my budget by a couple grand (do-able, I’ll just feel guilty as hell and have to postpone other fun things), I’ve only owned 2 bikes, so I may not know what I really want to direct the builder, I could probably get something good enough for cheaper (but I couldn’t find anything that really struck a chord with me). I don't need it….its a bike, hell my canon dale still works. It can’t be 6000 dollars better. Can it? I basically ride once to twice a week, 20-30 miles at a time. I don’t race. I’m not part of a club. I just like to go with myself and maybe one buddy. I’ve done some centuries/distance rides on my own. Thats pretty much my level. I ride for fun, its not a big group thing for me. What do you guys think? Custom steel? Off the peg? go for it? Too much bike for me? I was looking at the ritchey swisscross (looks like it would be a good one) and the Ridley x or nightfire (cross race bike I’d feel like a poser but damn it looks sweet and I love me a cross bike). I know those are both cross bikes, but I can’t find a good steel road bike that really hit me..besides the one this builder makes (Kirk Frameworks).Summary:
Summarize: My friend is breaking up with her boyfriend and as such, has to move out of his place. She has found a flat but doesn't want to live alone. I live a distance from University so it makes sense to move in together. But, she is really bad with finance and I know I would have to pay for everything and also be stuck in that city because I would feel like I need to support her. I plan to move away after university so I don't want to leave her with a flat she can't pay or have her have to move again after getting settled. I know this sounds really selfish and it is but I don't know what I should do? I can support her as a friend but I would rather do that through other ways. Should I move in with her or just tell her this?Summary:
Summarize: Pros: stupid fuckin cheap unlimited data means I tether it for constant mobile data on my android tablet easy to setup credit card auto-pay Wind TAB system is fairly simple: You get a phone (say $300) at the beginning of your service for free. You owe them the cost of that phone. Every month, 10% of your bill (pre-tax, if you pay $30 / mo, then it's $3) is deducted from that amount. If you end service with them prior to 3 years, you owe them the remainder, otherwise at the 3 year mark your remaining debt balance is pardoned. Cons: Low in-house phone selection, so if you're picky you need to buy your own phone outright and bring it to them (check in advance to make sure it's compatible) Small wind-zone areas mean phones become near useless if you travel a lot (roaming charges are expensive and prohibitive) Coverage in wind zones can be spotty at times. I work in the downtown core of my city and barely get a 2G signal at work.Summary:
Summarize: The fuck up was actually yesterday, but the consequence was today. Yesterday, I went to dinner with my mom and on the way there, told her about a girl I've recently met and become interested in. I gave her some background information, how we met, what she does for a living, how long we've known each other (3 weeks), etc. This is where the fuck up began. They're in the same profession (nursing), and I mentioned that they would probably have fun picking each other's brains about work. She joked about facebook friending her, and I asked her to wait until they've actually met. After all, we haven't been talking that long, and my mom is her own brand of crazy Okay, everything seemed fine. We went to dinner, got dessert, ran some errands and went home. This morning, Girl is texting me and says, "oh btw, your mom fb friended me and messaged me this morning." ... Are you fucking kidding me?? Thanks, mom, for doing exactly the opposite of what I asked. "That doesn't seem that bad," you say. But wait, there's more... [what she said.]( It's relevant to note that Girl is a nurse that works in labor and delivery, so it's possible my mom rationalized by thinking seeing my birth photos would be interesting to her. Who fucking knows.Summary:
Summarize: I had a vegan as a legal guardian for 2 years when I was 15. Biggest fucking bitch this side of the planet. She would always force her bullshit veganism on me. When I had enough of her shit food (she was a shit cook), I decided to get a job to buy the food (read: meat, cheese, eggs) that I wanted. Nope. She would not allow me to store meat or any other non vegan food in the fridge . So I said I would save up and buy a mini-fridge. Also nope. She said if I wanted to eat meat, I would have to find another place to live. That's exactly what I did. I called up my mom and convinced her to take me back. I lived in Alberta at the time, and she flew me all the way back to Québec. I flipped my entire life upside down just to get away from that crazy bitch Best. Decision. Ever.Summary:
Summarize: I was driving a commercial truck in NJ. Some dick was ass-hurt by my merging onto the highway at 50 MPH in a 55 MPH zone. (What can I say, it was a really slow truck.) The dick was doing 75 in the slow lane. He waited until the last second to slam on his brakes and honk his horn at me. And then, all road rage style, zoomed around me, cut me off and slammed the brakes. So I, of course, slowed down and changed lanes. He cuts me off again and hits the brakes. Again I slowed down and changed lanes. He does it again. The 4th time he does this I don't slow down, remain at my top speed of 62 MPH (slow ass truck!). He comes within 3 feet of my front bumper. I signal to bring it on, macho style, with a wave of my hand. Fully calling his bluff, and having gotten my message across that I was not slowing down again and an accident was OK with me, he flips me the bird and zooms off. Wish I had an iPhone back then...Summary:
Summarize: I worked Saturdays in a coffee house in 2009 whilst I was in Sixth form College in order to pay for the tube and to have a little extra as I was now old enough to go to the pub etc. My boss was no better or worse than any of my friends bosses seemed to be but after he got caught cheating his girlfriend broke up with him and he became intolerable, stinking of alcohol and yelling at us for pretty much any reason and taking out his problems on the staff. We knew he had been holding back tips, probably for more booze so we lost any sympathy and respect we had left. Because of this some of us started taking our lunch hour at the pub down the road from us rather than stay in the cafe where he would ruin that too. When we were in the pub football would pretty much always be on. Like most people, I had always passionately supported England and watched every minute of the World cup and Euros (my favourite players then were Rooney and Terry hah) but had never really been into club football because I didn’t have access to sky and had been too young to drink in pubs before then. My friend was a Chelsea fan so for his sake I said I’d support them but really had no intention of getting into football in my 2nd year of college with all my studies. Now the first PL game that I can say I actually watched was Arsenal Portsmouth. I only got to watch the first half before I had to go back but I remember seeing two sweet goals from Diaby that had definitely been team goals. I can’t say I particularly cared but I have to thank the footballing gods for letting me witness beautiful stylish football before I watched anymore matches so I could later realise that other teams did not possess the class Arsenal did. I never got to watch the second half because we had to go back to work but for the first time ever I bothered to watch Match of the day to see what happened and funnily enough remember being pissed that Diaby got injured near the end because I was hoping he’d be playing next time if Arsenal happened to be on again. I guess the footballing gods or shall we just say Bergkamp and Henry, were letting me know what I would be in for with Diaby. I didn’t understand how the league worked because I had only ever watched knock out tournaments like the world cup but my Chelsea friend knew the good fixtures and started scheduling our breaks so that we could catch at least the majority of a match. I was glad next week’s game was Arsenal again especially because it was against United and even though I wouldn’t say I hated them then I knew that they were the go to glory hunter team to support so it was fun to cheer for who I thought must be the underdog. I was surprised that I wanted to cheer when arshavin (I remembered him from the world cup because I found his name amusing... I was a teenager) scored an absolute rocket against them. I wasn’t used to cheering and was a bit shy still but went back to work happy although I later learnt from MOTD that Arsenal lost by a few goals in the second half. This carried on for a couple of months and I was lucky that there were quite a few Arsenal games on Saturdays and I eventually told my Chelsea friend I preferred Arsenal, almost feeling a little bad because he had tolerated noob question after question. Eventually though my work took an interesting turn of events. On Haloween my boss came to work in an absolute state and fired my Chelsea friend (It later turned out he had given away a free drink to a female mystery shopper because she was hot lol) and they had a huge bust up so he was extra pissed off that day and dickish to me. He had to shut up shop early because we were now short staffed. Although I could have gone home I went to the pub for lunch as usual and after being there for about 20 minutes got to witness the greatest few minutes of football I had seen so far; it was the derby against Tottenham (who I recently learnt were our arch rivals) and Van Persie scored a goal a few minutes before half time to give us the lead. I finally felt comfortable cheering because my friend wasn’t there and I didn’t really care what strangers thought. Even better was realising my boss was in the same pub watching on another screen and swearing his head off to anyone who would listen. I thought I would go over because it would have been awkward if he realised I had seen him and stayed where I was but just after I said hi, Fabregas had somehow already owned the entirety of spurs and scored again! I instinctively cheered and only then realised that my boss was a Tottenham fan as he got up and left without saying anything to me. I quit pretty soon after because it was shit without my friend but will always be grateful for lucky scheduling, an overly horny friend and my boss being enough of a cunt that it made Arsenal seem pretty much destined for me.Summary:

Summarize: Ok first off, yes I know they are stinky as Shit lol I'm just wondering. I have smoked one in a basement before but it was already filled up with smoke so I couldn't really tell how bad the blunt smelled. I live with my parents who are cool with me smoking, but I don't want the smell to leave the room- is that possible? Also it's not like I have to do it in my room, but if it's possible that would be a good thing to know. I've smoked with a gravity bong in my room before no problem. Also, does the tobacco make a difference in smell? Because the bathroom is kinda the designated smoke spot but if it smells worse I don't want to fuck it up. I guess that's it,Summary:
Summarize: I'm a rather new Redditor and this is not my main account but I need to get some things off my chest, process it all, and maybe get some advice. If this is the incorrect sub I apologise and please tell me where else I can go. I'm a nineteen year old girl from Australia. I was born in Central West New South Wales as the only (that I know) child of two addicts. My father was convicted at fourteen and spent most of his life before I was born as an aggressive and depressed alcoholic and drug dealer. He met my mother when she was in her early 20s and he established himself to my mother and her sister as a dealer. Within a few years he managed to get her to marry him and then dragged her out to a town (population of under 300) in to the middle of the country where the land is almost completely barren, not even the kangaroos would live there. He kept her there for more than a decade, during which time I was born. Through their various rages at me I've learnt from them that she still used coke and ecstasy throughout her pregnancy with me, but mainly used oxycodone^1. My mother left him when I was 18 months but I have vague memories and flashbacks^2 from then of dark rooms, shocking heat and a woman begging and screaming. She managed to escape to the coast on a train and found a women's refuge and managed to sober up enough to get us a dingy unit before my father followed her and found himself somewhere to live nearby. Between the ages of 2 and 5 I was relatively happy but this was really the beginnings of her abuse. I don't particularly think she meant to but she is and was so fucked up by the things that happened to her at the hands of my father and by the drugs themselves (which were evidently more varied than what I've been informed of) that I don't know whether to pity her or not. Between the ages of four and sixteen she forced me into seeing 12 counsellors, 8 psychologists, and 6 psychiatrists. I was diagnosed with depression, social anxiety, ADHD, ADD, Borderline Personality Disorder and manic depression, among other things, and was put on more and more prescription drugs as the time went on. But this was all masking the actual issues, which was that she beat me. She hit me, kicked me, pulled my hair out, forced soap so far down my throat she knocked out some of my teeth, and locked me in my bedroom for days at a time. I've done some reading online and she fits most if not all of the symptoms of Münchausen's Syndrome by Proxy, that she tried to gather sympathy for herself through me and tried to make it look worse by faking and even causing me to have illnesses. This became worse when my father, who refused to leave the city, took her to the family courts and managed to get dual custody of me when I was 7. I spent tuesday nights and even second weekends at his unit before then (from the age of 5), and became used to checking for syringes and broken glass in the grass and it was at that time that I saw my first dead body hunched over on the stairwell to our unit, surrounded by blood. Regardless, he still managed to get dual custody of me because I was more scared of my mother than my father at that point and over the course of that year (2002) I spent equal time between the two hovels. In the summer of 2003 my mother had one of her friends stay for two weeks. This friend and her son (a year older than me) stayed in my room and not only did I have to sleep in my mother's room (sometimes her bed, sometimes the floor), but I wasn't allowed in my bedroom at all. One afternoon I tried to go in my room to pick out a book to read and her friend pushed me out, pushed me against the wall and screamed at me. I started crying, ran into the kitchen and grabbed a knife before slicing into my throat. My mother saw it, called my father, and had him take me away to his house. I didn't see my mother again for close to two years, except for one time I was in hospital.* I had always had hearing difficulties, and my first year with my father doctors found out I had tumours in my head ( NOT brain tumours, they're between the brain and the skull itself) and I had my first operation to remove them then. Since then I've had 5 more surgeries, each time they've more aggressive (to the point of brain fluid leaking on the operating table and weeks in hospital to recover). The time taken to recover from the procedures, as well as other complications^3 has lead me to decide that it's better to live to 35 relatively normally than to 55 and spend half the time in bed and in pain. Essentially, I'm halfway through my life already, and I'm okay with that now. I'm a big girl, and I've had years to make this decision. So between 2003 and 2005 (age 8-10) I lived with my father exclusively and I don't remember much about this period besides vague memories, flashbacks and night terrors, mostly of things he did to me, or things he threatened to. Every couple of weeks he would grab onto my arm and pull me to the front door saying he was taking me 'to buy a box'. This box, he said, would need to be taken care of because as soon as we got home he would pack my clothes into it and drive me to _ , this suburb known for being a red-light district with more murders than births each year, as well as lots of gang activity. He said that within a week I'd be selling myself from this cardboard box, within a month I'd be shooting up inside it, within a year I'd be giving birth inside it, and within a decade I'd be buried inside it in an unmarked grave, as a sign of how worthless I am. That's stuck with me ever since, and it's still hard to process how he could hate his only daughter that much. I also remember him pretending to kill himself in front of me before getting up, cackling with glee, and pinning my hands behind my back and locking me in my room for a few days with just a bucket to piss in, a loaf of bread, and a lettuce. He also... lit my vagina on fire at one point. I don't remember it, I've blocked it out, but I've got burn scars over my vulva. He never told me why but as I've grown up I've worked out that he didn't want me to be able to have casual sex, if any sex at all. I don't know if he molested me, I wouldn't say I know he did, but it wouldn't surprise me given the burns and the fact that when I behaved he would 'reward me' by making me sleep in his bed, and before he went to sleep he'd turn the television to porn channels. I lost my virginity when I was twelve to this boy from school and he showed me that not everyone will hurt me, and I loved that feeling. I lived through it for years. I dropped out of school when I was thirteen because I was already earning a reputation and a group of boys would beat me up (to the point of broken bones) and sexually assault me a couple of times a week. I kept my mouth shut because these boys' parents were friendly with the principal and nobody would believe what I said anyway. But I got fed up eventually and in September 2008 I walked out of class and never went back. It seems that nobody even noticed me missing from school because nobody ever came to check on me. So, I began walking on a bad path, I met some people, had a lot of stupid sex, formed an addiction to it, and I moved drugs on the side for some income. Most of which I had to pay in rent to my mother in order to stay there instead of living on the street again. I was sixteen I overdosed. I'd had enough and really just reeling from some news I'd got a few months before^3. My mother's oxy^1 use (and perhaps the burns as well) had left me sterile. I had believed that I was going to be a mother one day and prove to myself I could be a better parent to my own children than mine were to me, but this was basically a slap in the face, and is one of the reasons I'd rather die at 35 than 55. There's just not that much use in me being alive any longer than that if there's nobody relying on me. Alas, evidently I didn't die then but I felt absolutely crap just looking at where I was in life so I decided to start a course and finish high school. I finish it completely next month, but I've stopped caring about it any more. It just isn't something that caters to my interests, and I'm not any happier now either. However, just before I started my course I met my ex boyfriend, this was mid 2012. We were in different social classes, but I figured he loved me because we had enough in common. I guessed wrong. We were together for more than a year, not that long for most people, but longer than anything I've managed before that. He was sweet, caring, and his family liked me, and I gave him every part of me that I could. But this wasn't enough and he turned obsessive, paranoid, nasty and abusive. Oh, and he cheated on me with another girl, which he used as a reason to break up with me, though that wasn't the reason I was given; which was that apparently his mother had seen me smoking crack, when I'd never even touched the stuff. But I was okay with that, I knew I was better off without him. This was mid 2013. 2013 was a clusterfuck. My grandmother died, my boyfriend dumped me 3 days after my 18th bithday, my dog died a month later and then, the pièce de résistance, I was raped by the man who lives next door to me. This was October 5th 2013. My finals started a week later and I failed all of them because I wasn't able to study, and I had panic attacks during the exams themselves. It's been a year and I still live next to him, and I can't afford to move. The Police said they can't do anything because I have no proof (besides scars) and the only things that are keeping me sane at this point is my other dog (a Great Dane), my best friend (who is pretty much my new boyfriend), my bong, and a bayonet from the First World War which I keep beside my bed to give me some feeling of security. My house caught fire in April, and a few months later the bolts to my screen door were cut. Twice. My mother laughed at me when I told her that I was raped because she likes the guy, but over the past 12 months we've begun to repair our relationship though I'm still wary of her and mainly use her to help me do my grocery shopping because I can't afford a car and this area has too many hills to be able to carry the bags home. On a side note, my mother told me that my father moved to the US (Arizona) in late 2008 and married a banker before beating her, divorcing her, taking her money and fleeing to Mexico. I haven't heard about him in two years, and I haven't spoken to him since early 2008. I know I need therapy, I know I've got problems. I can't sleep unless I'm stoned because of my PTSD^2 and I'm still dealing with sex addiction, but I've recently kicked my cigarette addiction (of a pack a day for around 4 years, and half packs for 3 years) which I've got going for me. Which is nice. I could really do with some advice on what to do.Summary:
Summarize: There's no nutrition in them. ATTENTION PEOPLE ENJOYING FAST FOOD I don't have anything agains it and you shouldn't give a shit about anyone that does, enjoy yourself, but I have experienced first hand what happens if you try to fuel your body on is stuff. inhale ONCE UPON A TIME blah blah blah I had a job that was 12 hours every day for straight labour in a noisy, dusty, hot, dangerous environment and it was exhausting, I eventually stopped making my lunches the day before I ate them and instead relied on those "microwave meals" that have the entire thing going on, like butter chicken, roast etc. they were great! 2 minute noodles and microwave meals, way less effort this is awesome. But then one day I almost fainted into a machine that was has rotating parts going unbeleivably fast, the food I was eating was technically food but it doesn't do anything to your body, [it's like I was eating nothing at all]( The next day when I ate just one sandwich it kept me going for the rest of the day.Summary:
Summarize: I am a 30/F. I am not a very jealous person. My 34/M SO of a year and I were out one day a couple months ago. I had no service on my phone and asked to use his to look something up on the internet. When I opened the web browser one of the quick links was to a porn site. I shrugged it off, but we have been together for quite some time and never knew that he was watching it. When I needed to use his phone again about a week later I decided to check his history and found that he watching porn usually at least once a week. We have a very intimate relationship and do have sex almost every day. Why would he still feel the need to watch porn (I am assuming when I leave for work in the morning and he is getting ready because that is the only time that he is really not around me other than when he is at work himself)? I honestly just want to know if it is just normal or if I should be worried that this might mean that he would be more likely to cheat on me? The fact that he is hiding that he does it bothers me. After he watched one time there was even a search asking how to delete his browsing history on his particular phone (which apparently was unsuccessful) Please any advice from the men of reddit here would help me!!!Summary:
Summarize: I've been friends with Kathy for going on 5 years now. She's so fun to be around, we have a lot in common, and in general I really like her. My husband really likes her husband, as do I. Fun people with similar life goals, etc. We had heard when we first started hanging out with them that they had a tendency to be a little non-social and that seeing them out and about was rare, and that has held up to be true. What particularly bugs me, though, is not that they're busy and rarely venture out to group things. I get they have their own lives. What bugs me is that they'll commit to something, especially she will, and then at the very last second cancel. Kathy and I share a chronic illness, and she'll often use that as her excuse to not do something. I understand that first hand, but I also know that she doesn't manage it very well and that there are things she could do to help that she doesn't. If her illness were her only excuse, I could live with the canceling though, because I know it sucks. But other times it's work-related things that makes her cancel, and still more times it's just something like "I'm tired." In the end, all the canceling makes me feel like she just doesn't give a shit about me. Two recent examples: We made plans with them for an event a couple months ago, we bought tickets, and then 3 hours before leaving they canceled, leaving us with two extra tickets and struggling to find someone to go with us. This weekend I planned a dinner out with just some girls, she said she was coming last week when I asked, and then literally as I sat down at the table at the restaurant she finally texted (after a week of no response about times/location preferences) to say she was tired and not coming. My dilemma is whether or not it's worth it to try to talk to her about this. Because we rarely see each other, it's more of a surface friendship, but I do really care about her and I know that if they continue this path of committing then canceling, they're going to alienate everyone they ever meet. I kind of feel like it's my duty as a friend to tell her that it hurts people's feelings and messes up their plans, especially to do this all the time, plus it's rude, and if I were doing something like this I would want someone to tell me. But then again I'm kind of done with this relationship and am struggling to make myself care what happens anymore. I'm certainly not inviting them to more things myself, but they're part of the group so I will see them and would rather things not be uncomfortable. If you were in my shoes, what would you do?Summary:
Summarize: So I am 20 years old virgin and have never been in a relationship. I always used to crush pretty fast on girls I found attractive in school. I didn't even know those girls.. Nowadays its still the same: I dont crush that quickly on a girl I find attractive anymore, but I still feel like I only can fall in love with women I find attractive. I started studying at a new University last year and hang out alot with 2 particular girls: Girl A I find attractive and get along with her well, but I dont see the chemistry, it doesnt feel like we would fit well. We are too diffrent in some aspects. Girl B is really cool, we have a lot in common, she understands my humor and I can be myself around her. I think we would fit very well together in a relationship. I even think she likes me a little more than friends. However I dont find her that attractive. She is by no means ugly or fat, but neither a stunner. The thing is, I started to develop feelings for Girl A. Not those crushy feelings from my early years, it was stronger. I dont know why my feelings are based so much on appealings? I could imagine such a great relationship with Girl B. Does someone have a idea? I dont understand loveSummary:

The sub has grown quite a bit, and whilst old posts used to reach 100 just barely, and when they were really good get to 200, mine reached 200 very easily and capped at about 400. Based on these numbers, I believe it's time to increase the UpKibler requirement to 200 UpKiblers to change the banner/theme just to account for increased HearthstoneCircleJerk Subreddit Traffic.Summary:

Summarize: I've pretty much been a CA for 2 years. Met a guy last July, fell in love with him pretty quickly, we spent New Year's in NYC blah blah blah. Shortly after or around that time, we started to drift apart. In March, he says that I'm a "best friend to him right now" and essentially, that I have to figure my own shit out before we can have a relationship (he's also an alcoholic with his own deep shit going on). I go into the psych hospital because of alcohol induced panic attacks (though that's hardly the only cause). He visits me while I'm there. I told him how they have me on a detox and I feel "calmer and healthier than ever." I'm sober one day going out of the hospital. I've tried texting him twice since he has claimed to be a support for me. Then, an angry facebook message as he didn't respond. I miss him. I drank for a whole month, then had two days sober, and I'm now drinking heavily tonight. Is it all gone? Do you ever feel you can control it?Summary:
Summarize: I don't know why I'm posting this here. But pretty much long story short I have a real close friend that recently told me on a drunk confession that the real reason her and her boyfriend broke up was she got raped. She is in a sorority so drinking is a given and so is heavy drinking. And what ended up happening is that she drank a little too much and she woke up naked in someone else bed. The issue is she cant forgive herself she still has a thing for her ex (whom she told everything and then he promptly left her). I don't know what exactly I'm looking for right now. I just don't want my friend to feel shitty, like she is a bad person because of a drunk mistake. We are all humans right? I don't exactly know what I'm looking for I just want her to be happy, cause its not fair she has to have this over her head when we all make mistakes.Summary:
Summarize: Freshman year- My Gf and I had been out most if the night at a friends apartment making weed butter and then a bunch of edibles. Between all the butter that had gotten on us while we cooked and all the edibles we ate we are both sky high. We get back to my on campus apartment, nobody's home. My three roommates all stumble in loudly about 30 mins later drunk as hell, they had been a some party. We are sharing the stories of our nights when we suddenly hear a shriek from outside. We are all fucked up so none of us really react until we hear a girl running down our hall screaming "help help!" Me and my four roommates all rush outside, my gf and a couple other girls stay behind in the room. We get in the hall and this panicked girl is just sayin"upstairs upstairs please you guys have to do help!" We are all way too fucked up to know what to do so we all just bolt for the stairs and run up to the third floor. We throw open the door to the hall to just see the walls covered in blood. Like fucking everywhere in HUGE streaks across the walls and big semi-soaked in puddles on the carpet. Despite being high as shit I am the most sober one of the four of us so i took the lead and ran towards this writhing body on the ground, then notice there is a girl crying hysterically nearbye and some shirtless dude holding her. This kid we all knew is just in a heap on the floor, he has this massive gash on his head that is just hemorrhaging blood and there is this huge rock like two feet to his left covered in blood. So I grab the kid and using what training I can remember while I'm so fucked up my roommates and I try to to talk to him and carefully rolled him onto his back. Although the whole time he keeps trying to sit up and grab at the rock while making this just like guttural moan. " Jack (not his real name) what's going on?" "Unnnnnggggg" "Jack come on dude speak to me what the fuck happened." "Unnnnngggggg" roommates:"Steve what do we do?!?" "Shit, well if he can't communicate we don't have a choice call 911" (bear in mind we all liked this kid and new that if we called the paramedics and cops this would be it for him at school) roommates look at me hesitantly but say" alright FUCK" So roommate A runs off to call for help while B,C, and I try to piece together what's happening while stopping the blood from gushing out of jacks head. Shirtless dude" we were watching a movie and suddenly we hear a knock on the door, Girl went to answer it and as soon as she opened the door this crazy fucker just decked her in the face!" Although he didn't elaborate more we were never sure how much of the damage on jacks body was dealt by shirtless guy but I have no doubt it was more than a little. While he is telling this to roommate C I am looking jack over and that's when I look in his eyes to see they were dark red and had pupils the size of dimes" FUCKING SHIT! He's high out of his god damned mind!" Turns out elsewhere on campus earlier that night jack had eaten several candies laced with LSD and was tripping his balls off. So anyway at around that point two cops, one of which I had a bit of a history with suddenly burst into the hallway guns drawn. We all throw our hands up as we are being aimed at and so jacks head starts gushing more blood. "What the fuck is going on?!" Dick cop yells "Don't shoot! We found him like this, he needs attention now! Also I think he's on drugs because he is completely nonresponsive, and keeps trying to hit himself with that rock!" I shouted gesturing to the big bloody stone. The cops thankfully lowered their guns and holstered them but then dick cop pulls out his taser and starts threatening jack with it ordering him to get down and comply or be tased. Roommates B,C,and Start yelling" No STOP! He doesn't understand what your saying let us just hold him down he's fine he just needs medical attention!" "Back away from him NOW!" So we all stood up, pretty well covered in blood, and did as he said. Jack pulled himself towards the wall and leaned against it but roommate B grabbed the rock and moved it away from Jack, who still kept reaching for it and the cop kept threatening to taze him if he kept moving, not that jack understood. Eventually the paramedics arrived and carted away Jack, and treat the girl who got a huge black eye. Never heard from jack again personally but B did and he said that according to Jack he had no recollection of how he wound up in our building or why he punched the Girl, but that he kept hitting himself with the rock because he saw it as his brain and was scared if he didn't get it back into his head he would die. So ya that was the craziest thing I saw in college although I do have some other good stories as well. Always remember kids, drugs can be fun, but they can also be very very VERY dangerous.

Summarize: If you don't have medical training, repeating something you read on the Internet or saw on a YouTube video as solid medical advice is not wise. Packing a wound with gauze and applying a pressure bandage along with a lot of direct pressure is how you treat a penetrating wound with non arterial bleeding. For arterial bleeding you apply a tourniquet atleast 2 inches above the wound, but probably up past the elbow or knee so you don't break bones puttin on adequate pressure, and then you pack the wound and apply a pressure bandage. You don't shove a fucking shitty cotton ball on a string into the wound. That's increadably poor advice. Tampons and pads also are not at all made for treating wounds and have lots of chemicals and fillers made to make nasty period blood smell less nasty that you really really don't need in a wound.Summary:
Summarize: Back in the late 90's, me and some of my friends went to a rave in San Diego (I forget the exact location, because this was the only time I had been there, and we were high as fuck). Now, my group of friends went to raves at least once a month for a year an a half, so we knew the scene, what to expect, and always had a good time. We also did lots of drugs. Well, by this point, we had been doing it for a while, so we got a lot more casual about the amount of drugs we were taking, and in what combination. At this rave, I took 2 ecstasy pills, 3 hits of acid, and smoked easily half an 8th of weed by myself. My best friend (we'll call him Stan) would often match me (if not exceed me) in drug consumption. At this rave, he took 3 ex pills, 5 hits of acid, and smoked a lot of weed. Once we consumed the drugs, we found a spot in the venue that we claimed as our spot, and just proceeded to dance, laugh, kiss, and just generally enjoy existence. After about an hour or so, I notice Stan was really, really into the music. He was basically oblivious to everyone around him, and was fucking dancing his ass off. Problem was, he was sitting down with his back against the wall. In his gyrations, he was hitting the back of his head against the wall, swaying in a circular motion to the music. This alarmed me, and I asked if he was OK, and he said he was feeling amazing. I say, alright then, and dove back into my trip. A few minutes later, I notice he's swaying again, this time hitting his head even harder against the wall as he swayed. By this point, my friends and I knew that something was wrong. we looked at each other, and decided that it was time to leave the venue. We thought maybe we could just chill in the car and ride out the rest of our trips until someone was sober enough to drive home. We stand up, and try to get Stan to get up with us. He won't budge. he doesn't even acknowledge the fact that we were there. After 10 or so minutes of trying to get him to stand up, we said fuck and decided to carry him out. Me and another friend pick up up, put his arms on our shoulders, and start to carry him between us to the exit. The whole time this is going on, Stan is mumbling complete gibberish...like not even actual words. And he's still dancing as much as he was able to (which amounted to him shaking and twisting while his feet dangled about the floor). It was not easy to keep him stable as we trekked towards the exit, but somehow we managed not to drop him. As we were making our way through the crowd, people were staring, because it was evident that something was up with Stan. The looks I saw on the faces of the people around us started to scare me, because it looked like they were looking at someone who was about to die. We continue to press on through the sea of sympathetic eyes and drug-addled souls, and finally made it to the exit. But, things are never easy when you need them to be. To get into this venue, you had to descend about 200 stairs. Stan was in no condition to walk on flat ground, let alone ascend a stair case. And he was still dancing and gibbering like a lunatic, so there was no way we were going to be able to carry him up the stairs. Some of my friends start crying at this point, because we didn't know what to do; our friend clearly needed to get out of the venue, but we couldn't do it ourselves. And since we were also all fucked up, our reasoning and logic skills were long gone. I looked over at Stan now that we were in regular light instead of black lights, strobe lights, and flashing colored lights, and my heart about stopped. He was paler than any white Irish guy has any right to be, and his normally ice-blue eyes were so pale that they appeared white, except for the pupil. And there was no recognition there. He didn't know who I was, who my friends were, where he was, or even that something was wrong. But he was grinning like the Joker. It was fucking terrifying. We were standing there, trying to figure just what the fuck we were going to do, when one of the security personnel of the venue saw us. he walked over and asked us if there was a problem. We told him our friend was not feeling well, and we were trying to get him home, but we couldn't carry him up the stairs. This security guard takes one good look at Stan, and says, "Wait here. i think your friend is OD'ing, and we need to get him to a hospital. OH. SHIT. "OD" is the LAST thing you want to hear when you're at a rave. Panic starts to creep into our minds, which then gets magnified a hundred fold because we were still high. Stan's girlfriend is crying, and most of my friends were crying as well. I was fucking bawling. This is my best friend, someone who I had known for about 12 years at this point, a brother, and for all I knew he was going to die because we were stupid and decided it would be fun to do a shitload of drugs. The venue had medics on-site in case of something like this, so before we could really process what was happening, the medics had taken Stan from my arms and were trying to get him to lay still so they could check his vitals and whatnot. But he was STILL thrashing around and mumbling. The medics asked me and my friends to come over and help hold him down so they could do their work, and they thought that having familiar faces around might make it easier for my friend to deal with this situation. So we all gather a kneel beside him, and try to hold him down with our arms. NO GOOD. He's thrashing and bucking and foiling our every attempt to hold him down. The medics again state calmly that we really need to hold him down before he hurts himself or someone else. So we sat on him, one person per limb, while his girlfriend sat on his chest and kept talking to him. He was still thrashing so hard that occasionally he would lift one of us off the ground. While the medics are checking him out, he suddenly turns to his girlfriend, and says, "Hey Wendy! How's it going?" We all looked up in shock...he spoke, and it made sense! She goes to answer him, but he slips back into muttering incoherently. After the medics checked him out, they said Stan needed to go to the hospital. They bring down a gurney, strap Stan in securely, and get him into the ambulance. his girlfriend and I rode in the ambulance with him, while our friends got a lift to the hospital by cab. We're now in the hospital waiting room. Stan has been taken away, and we have no idea what's going to happen. And I am still tripping balls; the floors and walls are heaving and undulating, colors bled into each other to make new, horrible colors, and my eyes are so sore from crying that I wanted to rip them our of my head. At one point, a nurse came in to give us an update. He was not in any immediate danger of dying, but he wasn't out of the woods yet. She then tells us one girl has already died that night from ODing at the rave, and how stupid drugs were. I lost it again at this point, and cried for a long time because I thought my friend was going to die. Somehow, I managed to fall asleep. I was awoken sometime later by another nurse, who said that they had pumped my friends stomach, and that he was sleeping now. It looked like he was going to be ok. I have never been more relieved in my entire life. Some more time passes, and they wheel my friend out in a wheel chair. He looked like death. He was still extremely pale, and looked like he had been beaten with a hammer. He had a huge knot on the back of his head from hitting it repeatedly against the wall, he had dark circles under his eyes, and was visibly exhausted. The doctor tells us that in addition to the drugs we know he took, Stan had also been taking some kind of medication because he had come into contact with poison oak a week or so earlier, and the medication was basically some kind of steroid. Stan is fine now and suffered no long-term effects from this experience (thank the gods for that). He married his girlfriend, has a good job and two kids. But we never did ex or acid again.Summary:
Summarize: I stumbled onto it. I had leveled 3 or 4 toons to Anor Londo(ish) trying to decide which playstyle I liked the best. Ended up going back to my first toon(dex/int in case you were wondering). Right after Anor Londo I cleared Duke's and Seath. I decided to take a break from the lord soul areas after dealing with Duke's and the Crystal Cave(beautiful, yet aggravating) so, I ventured back to Darkroot to Sif and on my way I was thinking "Hmm, have I killed the hydra and freed Dusk yet?". The DLC did not even occur to me as I had avoided spoilers fairly well and did not realize Dusk was related. Anywho, turned out I had killed the hydra. I went to Dusk's summon spot and did not see her sign. "Hmm, must not have freed her yet.". Headed to the spot, saw some swirly purple shit and was like "Huh. This is new." And that's all she wrote.Summary:
Summarize: Hello ;) I started to take a bit more care about my looks in general recently, wanting to move away from your typical "skinny nerd" I really want to shave down there, for obvious reasons, but every way I tried till now looked very weird to me :D I do not have a lot of upper body hair, however my legs and ass are pretty bushy. So when I just shave the genitals and the area around them, it stands out to have no hair there and then hair again on my upper legs. I dont want to shave completely (Tried it, it doesnt look very male :P) and trimming the entire body hair in an even way also looks kinda strange to me. Additionally I would still have short but undesired hair down there. I read about making a smooth transition from no hair to longer hair, but where should I start? I have no idea how I would look the best, fuck the taboos about men shaving.. Also I would love to know if I should trim my leg hair or just let it grow. It looks similar to this: [This is not me]( I am not sure if it looks manly or disgusting :DSummary:

Summarize: Mythic Grunt mech can be quite a challenge. Especially on the beach of Apex 7. Some tips: Try to use kinetic based weapons (Dmr, Br are best suited) since kinetic based weapons do extra damage towards vehicles. The grunt's cockpit windshield can be broken and the grunt has (from what i know) 2 crit spots those being from the front which are it's middle area and the actual grunt itself when exposed from it's cockpit area. Slow moving vehicles like the tank, scorpion are generally no bueno since the needlers the grunt fires have tracking and 1-3 needlers do massives amounts of damage and can potentially kill you, they are extremely powerful and the grunt mech is no pushover. Pay attention and when it's launching these red/orangish needlers in the air and take cover immediately. The best way to keep fire/stay alive and not have that dreadful respawn is to take cover/shoot. Take cover, shoot. Repeat this and watch out for those tracking needlers! Stay safe! Better then "getting in" all that damage and dying in 5 seconds while you're in the open thinking you're safe, you're not! Aerial vehicles are also such a huge target and will get absolutely melted in a matter of a few seconds. If you are using an aerial vehicle you can still be safe though! Just make sure to watch out for those tracking needles and have a "camping" spot to shoot, hide, shoot, hide. Rinse, repeat.Summary:
Summarize: My [now ex]girlfriend I was dating (for about a year and a half) would tell her dad about us having sex. One night while we were eating dinner with her family, someone said something along the lines of being exhausted from work. She then blurts out word for word "Yeah, I couldn't even move this morning cause Zach (me) was really rough with me last night"...Her dad pulled me aside later on and told me he was going to blow my fucking head off if he found out about us screwing again. Needless to say, I broke it off about a week after.Summary:
Summarize: I was 25 at the time and had divorced a few months prior. After my divorce I went into full manwhore mode. I'm a decent looking dude, 6'1", 205#, dirty blonde hair, blue eyes, I'm no gym rat but I have a job that keeps me active all day and in good shape. I'm 3rd wheeling it at a bar with my friend and his GF. We are getting shitty drunk (an every night thing for me at the time) and his GF says "I think my friend is coming to hang out with us." Cool, the more the merrier. About 20 minutes later her friend shows up. We will call her T, for the sake of anonymity. T is about 5"2 in heels, 100#, fiery green eyes, and a strawberry blonde. She was a solid 8.5 on a 10 scale when sober. In my condition she looked like an eleventeen. She orders up a vodka and red bull, and I exchange my empty beer for a fresh one. All 4 of us are chatting and laughing. And I noticed she touched my arm when she laughed...always a good sign. By the end of that round my friend and his GF wanted to shoot some pool. They get up to go grab a rack of balls and pick out some cues. As they left the table she leaned over, put her hand in my crotch and started rubbing my dick. She looks me in the eyes and smirks. "Follow me". Being the gentleman I am I oblige without question. She grabs her purse and leads me to the women's bathroom. Well by this time the fuckstick is at full mast and we go into the handicap stall. I close the door and lock it and she sits down on the toilet. I walk over and she unbuckles my belt, unbuttons my jeans, pulls down my boxers and starts giving me some violent head. She is deep throating and gagging. Spitting on my dick and jerking with the fervor of a porn starlet. She has my undivided attention. She pulls my member out of her mouth and asks if I have a condom as she continues stroking my crank. FUCK! "Nope, but I can go get one." She reaches for her purse sitting on the railing and fishes one out. Perfect! She hikes up her dress and pulls off her lacy little black thong to reveal a beautiful slick shaven pussy with a finger-width landing strip. She throws the soaked panties in her purse. She stands up, turns around and has one foot on the floor and her knee on the toilet seat. There, in all of its glistening glory, was my perfectly presented prize. I push myself into her and she starts cooing. I'm in awe that I'm full on fucking some woman that I've known for the course of a beer...fuck it. Trim is trim, and I'm in. I'm balls deep in T and rage fucking this girl. Balls slapping clit, she's moaning, and the rougher I get the more she soaks my rod and wails. She's a screamer. I give zero fucks at this moment. I hear the bathroom door opening and closing, toilets flushing, hand dryers cycling on and off...it doesn't phase me one bit. At times I hear women's voices...not T's and some are whispering, some laughing...I don't pay attention or acknowledge their words. I am completely zoned in on fucking the living shit out of T. It could have been two minutes since we began, it could have been an hour. Time was lost to me at this point and in my condition. She's moaning and screaming to god...there is no god here, only a sexually explosive man in the throes of a post divorce, self serving, fuckstravaganza. She lunges forward as I feel myself crashing into her cervix...she is trembling and shaking and tells me she wants me to come in her mouth. "Turn around". I rip off the condom dripping with her juices and shove my lube and precum covered dick into her mouth. She starts bobbing her head and fiddling with my balls...wham! I come like the fury of 1000 badgers spun out on crank, deep in her throat. She half chokes, half coughs, and the next wave of semen comes pouring from my member into her mouth. She continues to stroke me and squeeze my throbbing dick and coax every last drop from me. "Fuck yes! Let's get a drink and go shoot some pool!" She said through smiling lips, my once erect member shrinking in her hand. I pull up my boxers and my jeans as she takes a quick piss. She dries off and stands up. "I'm not putting my panties back on, they're soaked and I would just have to take them off again when we get home in a while." I wash my hands and as we exit the women's bathroom. There stands my buddy with a full on shit-eating grin, his girlfriend, and half a bar-full of strangers. My buddy hi-fives me and everyone is laughing cheering and clapping. I exclaim "who needs a beer? I need a smoke!" T was smiling and laughing, she wasn't embarrassed in the least. We stayed at that bar until closing. I got my tab for the night and it was only 12 bucks. The bartender said that a bunch of people were paying for my beers all night. And that I better not pull that shit again in his place. Fair enough. T and I were fuck buddies for a while but that all ended when she caught up to me at the same bar and I was with another woman. She got pissed and dramatic, and went completely left when I reminded her that told her I didn't want anything exclusive.Summary:
Summarize: Gen 3 reactors are, yes. Using thorium would be much cheaper. It's currently a waste product, so the fuel isn't super rare like uranium. Also, because the byproducts decompose so quickly, it produces a finite amount of waste. Once it has reached steady-state, the waste from one plant will never increase. Also, the molten salt reactors are not typically under pressure, so explosions like with light-water reactors won't happen. I am a rabid environmentalist and I think this is the best, most eco-friendly solution we have right now. Keep solar going, but this takes up a tiny portion of space, produces power on demand, and produces huge amounts of power. Plus, Thorium MSRs would only ever produce a finite amount of fuel with a 30 year half-life.Summary:
Summarize: I was driving a commercial truck in NJ. Some dick was ass-hurt by my merging onto the highway at 50 MPH in a 55 MPH zone. (What can I say, it was a really slow truck.) The dick was doing 75 in the slow lane. He waited until the last second to slam on his brakes and honk his horn at me. And then, all road rage style, zoomed around me, cut me off and slammed the brakes. So I, of course, slowed down and changed lanes. He cuts me off again and hits the brakes. Again I slowed down and changed lanes. He does it again. The 4th time he does this I don't slow down, remain at my top speed of 62 MPH (slow ass truck!). He comes within 3 feet of my front bumper. I signal to bring it on, macho style, with a wave of my hand. Fully calling his bluff, and having gotten my message across that I was not slowing down again and an accident was OK with me, he flips me the bird and zooms off. Wish I had an iPhone back then...Summary:

Summarize: Was the best part of working at LameStop. My co-workers and I made it a game to make the game sound so disgusting in an attempt to make the child cry when the parent grew upset. One of the best parts was the kid looking at the parent with big eyes "I didn't know!? What!?". Especially Spanish speaking parents who's English speaking children would take advantage of them to buy the M-Rated games and sadly will nod to anything you tell the parent because they don't understand. I spoke enough Spanish to mention the game had sex, violence and boobs.(GTA).Summary:
Summarize: I did something bad last Thursday and I don't think I can share this information with any of my friends(Due to the fact that I kept making fun one of friend about their situation) Background story: Whenever I have semester breaks I find time to walk my dog(trained without a leash). I take her to the same bike trail every-time. While my dog is going around doing her business, I am usually sitting on the swing of a jungle gym set. One day, another person(early 30s) was walking her dog through the trail. My dog(super friendly) not being on a leash walked towards her dog while I was on my phone. Our dogs started licking and playing(I still haven't noticed, music was too loud, until the she came towards me to compliment my dog.) She started asking me questions, like how did I train my dog to what school do I go to. We ended up talking for about 30 minutes while our dogs were running around playing. After talking we go our separate ways, I usually finish my walk by walking through some old friends neighborhood. For the rest of that break, I noticed that bitch took my swing set idea and tied her untrained dog to the rocking horse. I would then sit on the other swing set and we would talk until I started the semester again. Thursday: It's been 5 months, finals are over and I finally have time to myself. I drive home after work one day and noticed that my dog was sitting by the door, basically asking to go outside. So I put my backpack upstairs and grab the beggin strips. While walking my dog through the trail, I noticed that it was pretty wet after the rain, so I avoided the jungle gym. Even though I avoided the jungle gym, I didn't see my talking buddy anywhere. After my dog finished her business we took our daily lap around the trail’s neighborhoods. While doing this lap I noticed a woman waving at me from afar(Can't recognize face, wasn't wearing glasses). Anyways while she was waving at me she fell. So I ran towards her to lend her a hand. When I got there some of her groceries fell out of the bag, her heel was broken, and she had an abrasion. My dog completely ignored the incident and walked away without me.(Daily path, I assumed she walked home.) She asked me to help her inside her house, and get her the first aid kid from her bathroom. I helped her bandage up and she thanked me. As I am leaving, she asked me for one last favor, to get her groceries out of her car(because she said she hurt her ankle). I joked around and responded with "What am I your slave", she laughed and I walked away. After bringing in all of the groceries and her broken heel, she insist on paying me. She reaches in her purse but, didn't have any cash. She tells me she has some cash in her room and to follow her. I noticed a photo of her and another man on the ground. I asked if that photo was her husband she said no, that is my ex-husband. I apologized, saying I'm sorry for your divorce. She responded by saying divorce isn't always a bad thing. We get to her room and there were photos turned over. While looking through her drawer she apologizes and lets me know that she has no cash. She starts to undress herself, and me being the socially incompetent idiot I asked her "what are you doing".(That's way my dry spell was almost about to hit year). She responded "paying you". Anyways while we were having sex a car pulls in, she pushes me off and "screams my husband is here hide". My heart started to beat irregularly(fast pace) as if I was about to have a heart attack. I got all my clothes and ran into the closet. While in the closet my phone rang before he entered the house, my mom called me and I ignored the call. I call her back and asked why she called me. She asked if I were fine because, the dog came home alone. I whisper "yes, I am fine", she gets suspicious and ask why am I whispering. That is where I hung up. After hanging up the phone I see an empty 12GA(Shotgun) box to my left and literally almost had a shit my pants. Her husband comes upstairs and falls asleep in the bed. I had no communication with her, no phone number not a thing. I was trapped in a closet for three hours until she convinced him to take her out to eat. I heard the door close but, was too afraid to come out. The thought of a black man getting shot kept running through my head, they'll never know the full story and how I was seduced if he killed me. So I said fuck it and booked it, I ran as fast as I could out of the house. I noticed that the car was gone so I said fuck it I am going to get paid. I walk back inside the house and grab a good looking watch and sold it to my younger brother. It's been four days and I have yet to walk the dog. I never want to see her again, I'm so angry that I helped commit adultery. I think it's on a completely different level than cheating on a GF or BF. THEY WERE MARRIED. I can't get it out of my head, the only way I can sleep at night now is through self induced medication. I feel like I should go back and tell him but, he has a shotgun and I am trying to enjoy my life.Summary:
Summarize: I saw the second one recently and was extremely disappointed, I skipped through some of it because the dialogue was just so so bad, I understand that it's a kind of mick take of action films, but pretty much most lines are cliché 'action film dialogue'. And some of the throw backs to previous films are down right fucking terrible, one that comes to mind is when Arnie states for the 100th time- 'I'll be back', Bruce Willis retorts 'you've been back enough, I'll be back '- that's not too awful, but then Arnie follows it with something ridiculous like 'yeesh yippee ki yay'. I was just shocked at how far it fell from the first one which had some genuinely entertaining dialogue moments- as well as a more interesting story.Summary:
Summarize: I stopped playing ranks because of the amount of trolls and bad players in my bracket, which I might add is extremely low lately because I had a string of trolls five ranked matches Ina row...each match had a 10 minute que interval...personally I find it sad that people enjoy doing this... Then when I watch streams of higher elo players and see them trolling it kind of pisses me off because they encourage the trolling.Summary:
Summarize: I'll preface this by saying that I do not play much modern so if this is completely off base then I would love someone to come correct me. My advice would be to invest in Hallowed Fountains. My reasoning is three fold. Worst case scenario you have Blue shock land which will always have some sort of a value and is probably at its lowest right now at ~$7. This makes the spec relatively low risk. My second reason is Modern Masters 2015. Though I don't expect the same influx of people that the first Modern Masters brought, I do expect at least a short term increase in the number of players getting in. My third reasoning (and the one that is perhaps off base) is Monastery Mentor. Though I personally am not buying as crazily into the hype as some are I do think people will want to try to make it work. If it finds a home in a modern deck it would be UW or Jeskai making the potential for a quick bump possible very soon.Summary:
Summarize: I participated in the American Diabetes Association Tour de Cure yesterday and attempted the century route (on a cyclocross bike w/ street tires..different story). I definitely could have done the full century, but I got off course, took a wrong turn and ended up rejoining the century riders about an hour later and shaved 20 miles off of my route. At the end of the day, considering it was almost 100 degrees by the time I crossed the finish line, I'm OK with 80 miles. My longest ride prior to this was 47 miles, but I've had my fair share of 25/30/40 milers in training for this century and I've gotten pretty good at understanding what and when to eat and drink to keep going. So, I have a few questions/observations. I actually feel really good today. I attribute it to eating and drinking properly yesterday and having a big old recovery shake when I was done. Unfortunately my ass hurts...not my taint, my actual butt. I need a new seat. I was using a stock Fuji seat that to date has been great up to 40 miles or so, but once I hit about 60-70 miles, it was almost unbearable. And yes, I lubed and yes I was wearing proper padded shorts. I know a seat is very different for different people, but point me in a good direction. Is there an affordable line/brand ($100-$150ish) that I could start researching? Also, how do I measure my "sit bones" and use that data to find a seat? my heart rate was too high. i averaged 84% of my max, that is way too high, right? I've heard that if I can keep it around 70% that is ideal. Obviously climbing would push it up, but I feel like 84% is too high. what can I do? intervals? should i start jogging or doing a second type of cardiovascular exercise to mix it up? any breathing/resting techniques to get it down while riding? is the 10 miles left "wall" psychological/physiological or both? for some reason yesterday and on a few of my longer rides previously, i hit a wall with about 10 miles to go. i can't seem to pinpoint why since it's happened on rides of varying lengths and occur even if i am hydrating properly and eating right. this makes me think it's psychological and i need to push through it..or maybe it's both since obviously, i'm beating the shit out of my heart at 84% any input would be greatly appreciated. i have a true (hilly) century coming up in August and want to get this sorted out before tackling that one.Summary:
Summarize: Had 2 tabs each earlier this night with my gf snd our friend. Went to a park which is located on a hill. The view to the city is amazing. I was laying next to a small(ish) lake. Pelicans, ducks and some other water birds chillin', swimming around there. And the frogs quacking. Holy fuck how trippy it is to hear hundreds or even thousands of frogs quacking simultainiously. I was tripping there for at least 2 hours straight. It was amazing. Finally got home. Had a shower, because it's so damn hot. Got into bed next to my gf. When I suddenly felt sick and had to vomit.(I tend to get really nauseaus indoors). Brushed my teeth and back to bed! My gf soon fell a sleep(she had to wake up 1.5 h later to go to work). So here I am, left alone with my thoughts. The fan in the corner of my room was making this sound. It's quite trippy tbh. I switch it off just to switch it back on 5 minutes later(because it's so damn hot here). Here I am thinking and going through all the apects of this life, my life. When I suddenly come to a conclusion that I have to quit smoking. It was time for my gf to wake up. We snuggled, had sex. I made her some coffee. She had a cigarette and drank her coffee(only the half of it, we have so many cups half full laying around at the place). Off she went. I'm laying in my bed as I write this, and I have to say: I feel fucking amazing! Just something I wanted to share with you guys.Summary:
Summarize: So me and my friend decided to have a bowl after our first day of classes which then led to us curing our munchies. We realize it's tuesday and this one hawaiian place we live kinda close by serves spam musubis for a dollar a piece (spam wrapped in sticky rice and seaweed). So we troop on over and eat, then we decide we want some boba but before we go to smoke a bowl! As we are driving around this neighborhood we end up finding a spot to start packing. This is where it gets weird. As we find our spot, right when I open my stash bag, I blow into my bag to clear the air and the sound of something exploding comes from my bag and my hand is in the bag so my first reaction is part "What the fuck?" and "Is my hand still attached to my wrist?".. The aftermath is my hand being perfectly fine but the cheap ass lighter the clinic gave me is absolutely shattered with the gas everywhere.. Completely bizarre experience that we had to get our drinks instead but still ended up buying a new lighter to smoke lol. I had my bud, bong, lighter, bodyspray, grinder, and water in the bag. I have no idea what happened, ents any help solving this mystery?Summary:
Summarize: I have been lurking on here for the past two days and I have to say you guys have opened my eyes to what this crazy addiction has done to me and my life. I never thought that porn was controlling me but as I read some of your stories I started seeing that I would avoid people just to stay home and be near my computer just for that easy access even if I didn't have a way to watch porn at all cause ya know my SO was still awake. Now that I have typed out that last sentence I realize how awful it sound and how weak I have been. Well NO MORE starting right now I am back in control. I will be posting weekly updates in the hopes that having to do so will make me stronger and just resist the temptations more.Summary:
Summarize: While the changes also seem a bit excessive to me, I think the intentions are good(Plat 2 ADC main and I FUCKING HATE PANTHEON). Its in line with how they are treating long range ults as a whole(TF, Noc etc.). The problem is 100% the lack of counter play to Pantheons post 6 play. It just too face roll to press R from across the map and double kill bot lane. I think they should remove all changes except the ult range. This will allow lanes to ward appropriately to prevent him from ganking, but still allow him to punish lanes that don't invest the resources in vision.Summary:
Summarize: A few months I bought an iPad dock and it came with a free Apple remote thing. While I was just randomly browsing the internet I found out that it was possible to troll Macbook users with it. Being the idiot I am, I tried it at a Barnes&Noble on an average Sunday afternoon. I thought it would work out and it would be pretty funny. So first thing I did when I arrived was plop myself down under a table, and scan the room for Macbooks. First victim: College student with headphones while on facebook. presses button The college student nearly jumps out of her seat and proceeded to turn off the audio. She didn't know I did it. LOL All right, I screwed up with the second guy. I plopped the button down as I pointed towards his laptop. What I didn't realize that he had his audio on highest volume. So as soon as I plopped the button, extremely loud Metal music channeled through the whole cafe area and probably the whole building. And then the staff called security. I left the premises undetected and never went back.Summary:
Summarize: Today, there are a lot of Atheist racists in the south that hate Christians as much as they hate Jews and Blacks. They have a big problem with that "God will deliver us" bullshit and decided that they must seize what they can for the White Race before it is destroyed because God sure won't help. Many of these people are highly educated. My first experience with some of these groups was when I was visiting college friends down south. The leaders of these groups were actually people who went to the same caliber of schools as I did (the best). It was very surprising and it is something that has stuck with me. Their message is actually much more resonant because they lack that cognitive dissonance that many other racist groups have. They'll love this, I promise you that.Summary:
Summarize: Okay so my friend and I are going to go to his house this weekend to smoke. We did this 3 weeks ago and it worked fine. However this weekend another friend will be joining us so that makes 3. This is where it gets interesting, a while back, like last summer, I was at this same friend's house, we'll call him Larry, any way like 7 people were there and everyone got high except me. Fast forward the next day, my mom looks through my texts and finds out everyone got high, I get drug tested and of course pass because I didn't smoke. She eventually let me start hanging out with them again. She is 100% cool with Larry but I'm afraid that because this weekend there is more than just me and Larry she'll get hella suspicious and drug test me when I get home, (She has hella drug tests stocked up because my brother was a 'bad' kid lol) so, what should I do? I really want to smoke but my parent's trust me a lot and if they were to find out they'd be really disappointed in me, I'd lose their trust, and I'd feel really bad about myself. So I'm not sure if I'm just over reacting or not.Summary:
Summarize: You punch the computer wall of your makeshift hive again in frustration as your husktop proceeds to freeze up. You were damn sure your programs would actually succeed at preventing stuff like this freezing up your computer, but you have to admit to yourself, you were always a lousy programmer. You were far more mechanically-minded. You stare blankly at the familiar fist indentation in the machine next to the husktop for several more moments before you go about and begin to captchalogue most of your possessions. You were about to embark on a trans-Pacific voyage, after all. As you marked a spot in the archaeologically potent environment your sylladex always automatically generated, to store one of your --Dooms--Day --DeviCes in that spot, you pondered the ways you might arrange for transporation to Australia. If you remembered correctly, Australia was across the largest ocean that could possibly divide two continents on this planet. This meant swimming was far too time-consuming an option, as was waiting for an Alternian transport ship or searching for a teleport pad. This planet was very backwater, and seeing how it hadn't been conquered yet, neither of these extraplanetary resources were abundant yet. You suppose you could travel to the big airport at Human Albuquerque or the big seaport at Human Los Angeles and stow away on one of the primitive means of human transport. Yes, that's what you'd do, and you were always most efficient at avoiding detection, so infiltrating either port would be no problem whatsoever. As you automatically bury your collection of books, you look fondly at the spot you always hid your DATA-WIPER, the small remote control-like device you used to wipe any signs of your presence from the primitive, easily manipulated human technology. This had to be your proudest and most prized invention yet. You then proceed to captchalogue your BROKEN RC LEGO MILENNIUM FALCON (piece of shit that it was), your entire collection of skulls, bones, and other archaeological artifacts, various machine parts, other half completed projects of yours including several incomplete doomsday devices, the INCOMPLETE PROTECTIVE SPHERE GENERATOR, and the INCOMPLETE JESUS JUICE SERUM. Unfortunately, for both of these latter two, positively aligned projects, you'd hit major blocks while constructing and were stuck. You simply couldn't build any more doomsday devices without completing any protective devices as well; without protective devices as well, not only would your doomsday devices potentially kill you as well as their intended planets, but your KARMATIC EQUILIBRIUM would be thrown completely out of balance. You had to take care to guard both the gates to hell and to heaven equally, lest uneven devils or angels escape and achieve dominance. Now that you're at the bottom of this overly-wordy post, you're pretty much completely packed prepared for later archaeological rediscovery, save your Husktop, which you left out just in case it decided to cooperate. As you check on you husktop's responsiveness, you try to sense where Wolfmom has gotten off to, carefully listening and sniffing the air to see if you can detect her.Summary:
Summarize: Take your own advice, and fuck off. Someone sees that shit all the time in a war zone, and comments on a video with similar visuals, and you tell him he's obviously no fun at parties? Go watch the testimony the soldier gave on the Apache video from Iraq, where they attack innocent men, and then children in a van. Bodies laying on the ground. That shit sticks with you.Summary:

Summarize: We bought a new house 2 years ago from the family of an old man who had passed. We had to take down some drywall in my current room, so my dad, his friend and I decided to start by my closet. As soon as we finish dozens of papers fall out of the wall, it was LOTS OF GAY PORN, I mean ALOT. It was all from the early 2000's.Summary:
Summarize: I've played through it twice on PS4 and never encountered any bugs. It was a very solid gameplay for me. I only have issues with some of the game mechanics, but that's my own opinions. I'd buy it if I were you and if you know what you're getting into. It's not like many of the other games out there, you have to be very strategic and focused at point, similar to the games of the Souls series. That said, it has many differences from those games as well in many aspects.Summary:
Summarize: They have been pulling some tight strings to make certain evolutions work. It isn't even explained as to how Lava got her new wings, and it feels like it was implied that she was done for when Phee went crazy on her and she ended up giving her wings to Vargas. I mean, sure, Phee's lore mentions her wanting to fight Lava again and lets her live, but then comes the whole Lava giving up her wings no 7 star for uuuuuuuuu. Alim went like "DERP NOPE, NEW WINGS, OUTTA NOWHERE". Which I am TOTALLY grateful for. And Kuda is probably be one of the seven stars due to a few things. First his own lore conflicts with Atro's lore. On Atro's side, he was a dark assasin that was apparently on God's side, on Kuda's lore, he was a seen a spy infiltrating the God's army. Then he proceeds to make excuses as to avoid fighting a weakened Atro. How she didn't notice this at all, that he was lucky enough to never be attacked by the very assassin hunting her around when Urias left him, baffles me. But what I think sets the nail in the coffin is that his own lore isn't conclusive. This literally leaves the door open to let Alim do whatever they want. Death no longer seems to be a stopping point, just whenever Alim decides to end their stories. So far, I think the "Door" is the stopping point. Or... whatever they feel like is the stopping point. I was almost certain Emilia would get a 7 star before anyone else on that batch since Eze was with her and she clearly survives. I mean... Luther apparently one shots douglas. Phee rolfstomps Lava. Will... will probably get a 7 star. Don't think he is mentioned anywhere to have even suffered a wound. Alice apparently dies on her 5 star form, and then someone revived her at her 6 star form. This was way before Elza came out. This makes me wonder if the one Elza revived was Alice on her 5 star form. Now for Uda. This is an interesting one. In Uda's lore, he goes for the Captain, but saw someone else strike Mega right in front of him and Uda notices that it was a setup from the Gods to strike Mega, and is then left to fight a Female Pirate (Stya). Now, Mega, on his 6 lore, is mentioned to have suffered a fatal wound from an suprise attacks from the gods, but the Sea Spirits came back and saved him and he earned the trust of Pirates. Pirates. Stya. Pirates. Which he was trying to regain their trust. And Uda's Lore a pirate, Stya, goes apeshit on Uda 'cuz of what happens to Mega. This... might imply he gets a 7 , but he clearly survived at 6 stars on his own lore despise having fallen in another units lore. Which... makes me feel like Kuda might get a 7 too. Another thing is that their lore seems to be done way ahead of time. Everything that happens on Mega's 6 star lore fits with units that were realeased, way, WAY later. He appears on Stya's 6 star lore giving her a kiss like "Death? PSHAAAAWWWW"! Not to mention his reason for survival literally came outta nowhere. It's as if Kuda's 7 star lore could start with him being quickly taken somewhere after suffering a mortal wound. Or something. Meh, I am in the middle, that "taking his life" line buggers me so much if it is the end of what seems to be one of the most interesting characters in the game. Will admit, Struck down (Uda's Lore when Mega gets owned) doesn't sound as bad as "taking his life" (Atro's Lore when Kuda gets... penetrated). But yeah. This is my take on it. Edit : Holy shit, I wrote too much.Summary:
Summarize: Safe answer: "I'm not against a god... I just believe that if there's a god out there, there's a pretty slim chance that it's the god of the hebrews." To be a bit more technical: "Okay, remember 2Tim 3:16, all Scripture is inspired by God, etc. etc?" "Yes?" "What if it's not true? I mean, what if someone, say... a Catholic priest in the 4th century added that verse to the Bible so that the Church could add all the bullshit they wanted?" If you want to be a bit more technical: 2King 22:8 and following: > 8 Hilkiah the high priest said to Shaphan the secretary, “I have found the Book of the Law in the temple of the Lord.” He gave it to Shaphan, who read it. 9 Then Shaphan the secretary went to the king and reported to him: “Your officials have paid out the money that was in the temple of the Lord and have entrusted it to the workers and supervisors at the temple.” 10 Then Shaphan the secretary informed the king, “Hilkiah the priest has given me a book.” And Shaphan read from it in the presence of the king. So what if Hilikiah didn't actually FIND the book of the law, but wrote it himself to gain political power? I mean, there's a bunch of hebrews each one with its own religion, and then the king says: Hey, I have an idea, let's make up some myths and pretend that all our suffering happened because we didn't obey some commandments that the people don't even know that existed?" Then you can go on the Deuteronomy and recall all the ridiculous laws that were put there, like no eating shellfish, no pork, not mixing crops, not wearing clothes of different textures, the mysoginy... and then ask: "Don't you at least feel that these laws aren't actually inspired by God? Them being made up by some jewish priest thousands of years ago actually makes a lot of sense to me."Summary:
Summarize: Prelude Hi guys, I'm a support player, with party MMR currently at __15__k. Dotabuff [here]( When I started playing, I realised how challenging and important the first 7 minutes are, in securing a solid early game. I break it down below, to give an idea of how a support (at my tier) is done in the typical pub. I can't really go into the specific HOWs (otherwise this post will get too long) Here goes: (Fountain) >I buy the wards and courier in pubs, since I'm often the only support. I buy tangoes. I pass 2 tangoes to the mid, and 1 ward to the offlaner. With my remaining, I buy branches/circlet/clarities/saveforsentries depending. I head to check if my pull camp is warded, and secure safelane bounty rune with my carry. Scouting is important because it gives you an idea if you need to rotate lanes, or which spots are possibly blocked. You don't want to waste sentries guessing wrong. 0:30 >0:30 I check the creep spawn to ensure my pull camp isn't blocked. If it is, I get sentries. I show my face on the bottom lane to zone the offlaner with some mana and HP, heading back to the pull camp by 0:53 to stack the camp. 1:13 >I pull the creep wave to the stacked camp, and co-ordinate with the carry to keep the creep wave momentum within the magic box just in front of the tower. If needed, I do a pull through to the other camp, or pull only half the creep wave, depending. From this, I should get a level, and enough gold to buy a TP from the side shop. 2:00 >I secure the 2 minute rune for mid, and see if he's doing well. If he needs a ward or spare regen I might need to ferry it out and babysit him a little. If I have another support with me, I might attempt a courier snipe. The 2:00 rune fight coincides with a good time for supports to pull their first gank on your offlaner/mid, so be prepared to TP. This is a good time to rotate to an aggro tri / dual lanes / dual mid if needed. 2:53 >Stack a big camp for your carry. Upgrade your courier at 3min mark. Go back to secure your carry's farm and control momentum. Pull at 3:43, stack a big camp at 3:53 again, and secure the 4min rune. 4:00 and onwards >Again, rune fight. Night time vision is a good time for ganking (or being ganked so make sure you carry that TP. Try to get your boots soon, if possible. A crawling support is no use to anyone. From this point on, you may need to roam accordingly, stack ancients, secure your own farm / levels in lane etc depending on the situation, and repeat the pulling, stacking, ganking until 7 minutes and beyond. Remember to get the next set of wards at 7:00. If you're snowballing hard or dying, spend your unreliable gold on TPs (drop them at fountain for your team). If your mid dies, buy him a TP so he doesn't fall behind too much. General Tips for supports Take timings. Big spell cooldowns, aegis expiry, ward expiry, smokes refreshing rate, etc. Just hold Alt + click on the clock to note a time. The carry needs to tunnel vision sometimes to ensure the last hits go well, and you need to watch the bigger picture. If you remember to stack at :53 every minute you have nothing to do, you'll be surprised at how rich your jungle becomes. Watch your map. TP reaction is important in protecting your cores. Most of the time the TP alone can scare them off. If you reach late and your core dies, it's still a free lane for precious XP and gold (spend it wisely, remember to get your cores a TP to get back to lane ASAP). Ward wisely. You only have so many wards. Depending on what your team needs, you may have to ward deep, defensive, in tricky spots, and other purposes, e.g. blocking enemy camps, behind towers. Your wards determine vision and how your team fares. If you're dumping them blindly in the same spot overlooking the rune from minute one to the moment your ancient explodes, go check out some good warding guides (or get a lobby with a support and ask them to show you the spots) Support meta items to help your carries may include value medallions, basi/mek-part auras, force staffs, glimmers, crests. These are useful on almost any support in protecting your carry. A late game Vlads for the %dmg helps too. Conclusion This is by no means a complete guide to anything. Do not follow the above guide blindly, they are considerations you should think about, but game situation dictates that not all of the above will apply. I just want those <4k MMR aspiring supports to get an idea of how hard this role is, and maybe for cores to appreciate a good support when they get one. Pulling, warding guides, and decision making are things that I don't cover in-depth here. I also don't cover battle positioning, dying for value, etc which a good support should know. It may also apply more selectively in 6.84, where it's much less of a 4 protect 1 strat. But until they phase out the support-carry meta totally, parts of this should always apply.Summary:
Summarize: Ok, so I live in a single dorm room and my university provides a few pre-furnishings in the room so we don't have to purchase everything, which is lovely of them to do and I adore the computer desk and the armoire and my bed, BUT the couch...the couch is the WORST. It LOOKS pretty but is probably the least comfy couch I've ever sat on.... It's upholstered with faux leather and I can only describe the seat cushions and back cushion as being "strangely stuffed" they are somehow too firm and hard while simultaneously lacking in sufficient support. Not only are the cushions uncomfortable but the angle created by the back of the couch and the seat is really awkward when you sit down and it's impossible to sit comfortably. ((This really sucks because A: if I have to have a couch I’d like to be able to sit on it without slipping a disk and B: I'm the only one of my friends who lives on campus so we all tend to congregate in my room to study/hang out but no one ever wants to sit on the torture couch. There's literally NO space for additional seating in my room, and only a certain number of people can fit on my bed (not to mention that a few of my friends WILL NOT sit on my bed because "ew sex juice"))) The university requires that all school supplied furnishings remain in the room at all times and you get fined pretty harshly if you remove any of them so it seems that I'm stuck with this devil couch and unable to replace it with less horrible seating. Does anyone have ANY suggestions on how I can make this monster more comfortable?!?? I'd MAYBE be able to remove/replace the cushions and just throw the original ones on top of my dresser but I obviously I can't make and permanent or damning alterations to the hate seat because it's school property....any suggestions?Summary:
Summarize: Holy shit what a day. I'm pretty fuckin' stoned right now so forgie any typos. Also, I can't for the life of me organize a story at this time of day. So enjoy? Anywhey, so I'm havin a good ol' sesh on the back porch with my buddy. It's dark outside, music is playing.. casual. Suddenly it sounds like a monster truck is coming down the neighborhood. Stops near the house, I hear a quick acceleration and he's gone. My car alarm got set off, assuming it was his loud ass exhaust that set it off, I quickly turn off my alarm and resume the sesh. 10 minutes later we're heading to get some food and come to find the trashcan and all of its contents spilled on the driveway. There's clear trashcan skid-marks heading to my car. Sure enough, I look at my car.. there's a big ass dent. BUT THAT'S NOT THE WORST PART. The trashcan just fucking missed my plastic bumper and nailed the metal. Trashcan went bottom first, the hardest part of the trashcan just so happened to nail my car. Here's the fun part, I listen for this fuckers exhaust (it seriously sounds exactly like a damn monster truck). I hear him in the streets and my buddy and I get in my car and head to the noise. Stopping occasionally to see where he's moving to. We're driving and I noticed the image I pictured this vehicle looking like waaaaaaay far down the streets, flip a bitch and fly down the neighborhood (really late, general public asleep, I was pissed) and find this huge lifted bronco style decked out with KC lights, a tire rack on the roof, the whole package) He's parked in the middle of a culdesac with his lights off. He turns his lights on when he sees me coming and bolts it in a different direction, I'm chasing his ass while calling 911. This truck was hauling ass, I realized I was driving super reckless so I gave up. I didn't get plate so they got away. I filed a report on the damage but I highly doubt anything will happen. Fucking bull shit.Summary:
Summarize: Bear with me here. Women seem to like it when I talk dirty to them (because I've learned to do it right; always be real, don't ever be cheesy, yada yada). One or two haven't responded but most do and some go absolutely crazy for it. Well today a thought occurred to me that sounded absurd at first, but after considering it, I'm wondering if it might have a positive effect. Let me explain by backing into this: See I dated a girl a couple of years ago who knew the secret to outstanding sex with a man (other than being relaxed, passionate & open-minded). She acted as if she worshiped my cock. She just couldn't get enough of it. Ladies, if you don't already know, this is the secret to being the best a man has ever had. Anyway, a couple of times she came over, unzipped my pants and started saying, "There's my boy! I missed you! How have you been!?" and would continue, even with her mouth full (another huge turn-on). Now the talking to it was obviously just her being funny and we both got a kick out of it, but I think it actually added a level of turn-on for me. So I'm wondering, if done right, could it also be a turn-on for a guy to talk to a girl's pussy the same way?Summary:
Summarize: My husband (29) and I (28) have been married for 7 years, together for 10. We've always had a good sex life and although we've been through some rough patches, I think we have a great relationship and communicate well. However, the more of my friends that divorce, and the more I read about seemingly healthy marriages falling apart, the more I worry that we will face this type of situation sooner or later. We were both virgins when we met (although not by the time we were married), and I worry that sooner of later he will decide that he wants to try someone different. I try to stay physically attractive (and I find him very attractive still). We have no children and no plans to have any. My question is this: Men, what do you wish your wives would do/would have done differently after you'd been married for a while? Wives, what do you do to help spice up your sex life? I'm not interested in swinging, but am open to other suggestions.Summary:
Summarize: After crazy weight loss/gain/loss/gain, my breasts have finally given up, and lost their battle against gravity. I'm only 20 years old, but they've lost virtually all their breast tissue. So I'm going in for a reconstructive mastopexy/augmentation. I've been so unhappy and self conscious about my breasts for years, because on top of all this, they're about two cup sizes different. I know there will be some pretty obvious scars, but I'd so much rather deal with that. I just want a little bit of confidence, and to stop stuffing one of my cups, and be okay with wearing tighter shirts, bathing suits, and dresses. You know...feeling like a woman. I was wondering if anyone here had gone through the same procedure? How was the healing process? How long were you unable to be at work? Anything I should expect? Also, how many cc's did you get? I'm small waisted, but have some hips on me, so I was thinking a full C cup would compliment my figure. Did you lose nipple sensation? Are you happy with your results? I'm just starting to get really scared, and know my ladies on 2X always having supportive things to say.Summary:
Summarize: Hi everyone, this might be a long read but I'd really love the feedback and advice if you have the time. I've been feeling very lost lately and I think that about seven months ago I may have screwed something up that could've been the best thing in my life. Basically I started seeing this girl in December 2014. She was a co-worker and the first girl in a long time that I was just really into, and I mean in the kind of way that just spending time with her at work was worth the eight hours a day. Once we started to become romantically involved I felt it was only fair to tell her that I had recently made the decision (recently as in before I met her) to move across the country. She was sad to hear the news but excited for me to start a new chapter in life and did not want to tie me down in any way. We stayed "together" up until the day I left and continued to miss each other once I arrived at my new home. Sadly the distance and time got in the way now and again, but even the thought of her was enough to put a smile on my face everyday. In October of 2015 we hadn't really talked a whole lot in a few months, no fights or anything, just kind of fell off the edge with one another. I started to see this other girl, but nothing serious, when the girl from back home (let's call her Katherine) reached out and said she wanted to come out and visit. Since I wasn't serious with the other girl at the time, I welcomed the visit and was pretty excited to see Katherine again. The weekend came, she visited, we had a blast, she left for home and I stupidly didn't keep up contact. Things between me and the other girl picked up and now here we are dating since around late November. The current girl and I have just been fighting a lot. We both have pretty stressful and hectic lives and we tend to take it out on one another which isn't healthy. We just had a weekend apart since I was out of town and the whole time was spent arguing via text messages. Normally this alone would suck, but recent memories of Katherine have been popping up very frequently and it's made me more sad than I've been in years, almost to the point of tears. Katherine was seriously able to turn any problem around and just make me feel comforted, and instead of pursuing it and trying to maintain a long distance (for now) relationship, I let it fizzle out. Now I'm with someone who clashes with me more than I'd like and I'm afraid of what to do. So before I wrap up here, this is the big issue. I've had several relationships in my life and the one constant thing is that I tend to wind up thinking the grass is greener and sometimes that becomes the downfall. This very much doesn't feel the same because Katherine and I were never actually "official", and the way she made me feel, I can honestly say is a way I've never felt before. So here I am, almost 30, stuck in yet another situation where I don't know what to do. Do I stick it out with current girl who I fight with all the time but we're trying to fix it? Or do I let the strongest emotions I've ever felt in my life take over and see if Katherine and I are something that could be great?Summary:
Summarize: I'll try to keep this short because I'm so beside myself. And, just, incoming. Pity party/woe is me/angst/nobody loves me/horrible person with horrible thoughts bullshit incoming... I've been dating my boyfriend (27/M) for close to two years. We've been living together since June of last year due to individual circumstances that lead up to that decision. No one needs to tell me that was a bad idea, as I'm reaping the repercussions. Not even a year after we started dating, because of being overworked and just plain lazy, my boyfriend ignored me for an entire six months and masturbated in secret. Leaving me to wonder why he wouldn't come to bed, why our sex life tanked, why nothing I was doing was turning him on or getting him interested in me. Sex, to me, is important, I love to bond, I love to make my partner feel good, and I would hope they would do the same for me. My boyfriend is very much more of a quality time person, gets his intimacy from day to day pleasantries, eating dinner together, etc. He was getting his needs met during this six month period and, I guess, just never thought to give a shit about me. This whole situation has turned me into a fucking monster. I am sad and angry all the time. I've been very depressed because I just feel fat, ugly, stupid for ever believing him when he said he loved me, and just "less than". Until very recently, I had a serious addiction to alcohol, that sent me to the hospital once, unbeknownst to him. We're in therapy, he recognizes why he did was wrong, and why, he knows he's screwed this relationship up almost irreparably, and I'm trying to work with him and trying to learn to forgive. But, last night, I almost lost it on him. I noticed when we came home from therapy yesterday that his mood tanked. I asked him what was wrong, and he said that he wasn't sure if I'd be sticking around to fix this with him, and ever marry him, because that's what he ultimately wanted out of our relationship. He later admitted he just wanted me to tell him everything would okay. That is what I should have said, 100%. Instead, I dodged his feelings and went on a diatribe about how I didn't have a timeline on forgiving him, that I was seriously, deeply hurt still, and didn't think six months was ample time to get over it, considering I've just only recently decided to get a handle on my health in an attempt to improve my self-esteem. He immediately got upset and yelled at me, "This is why I never fucking talk to you!" And turned his back to me (we were in bed). I kind of tried to keep my cool, but ultimately had an anxiety attack, and started defending myself. I basically retold the story of how he wasted six months of my life, cheated me out of a satisfying sex life because of his own selfishness and laziness. He told me I was turning the conversation away from him, making it all about me. I agreed, telling him it's rather hard to sympathize with someone who willingly ignores his girlfriend's needs because "I was tired, and pleasing another human being is too hard". Yes, he actually said that to me. He tells me two wrongs don't make a right, basically, that I can't suck him dry, and ask for all of this physical attention and yet make no attempt to meet his needs. He says our dynamic right now is unhealthy. I agreed, but, pointedly explained that I was justified, and not just doing it because "it's too hard/It's too much work". You know, I'm not a lazy asshole (or wasn't). I busted my ass and gave him way more than he ever deserves, and he took me for granted, and hell yeah, I'm fucking pissed. We ended the conversation without a resolution, and went to bed. But, holy fuck. I just want to strangle him. When he says things like this, it comes off as, "I apologized, started doing everything you asked,"(that he should have been doing in the first fucking place, but, I digress) "WHY WON'T YOU FORGIVE ME AND GET OVER IT???" I'm so out of my mind, confused, over all of this. I'm pissed that he's making such a big deal about me still being angry about being outright ignored because considering your SO's needs are "too hard", and I don't want him to have the security he previously had, because I feel he just wants something to abuse, again. When he told me that he felt I didn't love him anymore, I had to pause and redirect the focus of the conversation because, I honestly don't know anymore. I got burned, bad. I don't want to go through any of this ever again. He says he just feels like he's paying a debt, and nothing will get better, because it's been six months and I've still barely loosened up about it. I can't help but agree, part of me wants him to suffer what I suffered. Fuck him, right? But, logically, and on an empathetic note, it's 100% wrong to be like this with him. So I'm very lost, reddit. What do I do now? I want to work through this. How do I start to see him with at least a semblance of what I once did? How do I learn to respect him, again? How can I let go of all of this anger? I've gotten so bad since we started seeing our therapist, that she suggested I go on antidepressants because of how much more miserable I look every week. Every other aspect of my life is tied to this relationship. My job, my friends, things I value, and love, and want to be around to cherish. I used to have my boyfriend on that list, but now, every time we're in a room together... I don't know. I'm so tense, I feel like a burden, I feel like he'd be better off married to his hand, or someone he actually fucking loves, and treats them the way he should have been treating me. I'm so lost...Summary:
Summarize: So, I am 26 and have an above-average penis size -- at least from what I have read in various publications. I'm a little over six inches, good girth, never had any problems with my tool. I've been in a relationship for the last eight months, give or take. My girlfriend is great, the love of my life. We get along amazingly and along with that comes the best sex of my life. Really, sex with her just keeps getting better and better -- and we do it a good amount. Some days we will have sex two or three times, but every time we are together (we don't currently share a residence) we usually fornicate at least one time. In the past couple months, my girlfriend keeps saying that my penis is getting bigger. I always say, "Ha ha, yeah right. I wish," but I am not a physiological expert nor am I one to just let things go and not think about it. Her reasoning is that nowadays, I get really hard all the time. My penis is like a cobblestone, or a jackhammer -- whichever you prefer. It's on another level and I am actually wondering, is my penis growing or is it just functioning at a sexual peak? My girlfriend must have a lot to do with this. I honestly don't masturbate all that much (couple times a week), but I have been having sex since I was 18 and I have never been this hard this often. My penis feels like a super penis, at least to me. So, is it crazy to suggest that a penis can grow after 26 years of living? It's almost like one of those things, when you hear it so much for so long, you start to wonder if it could actually be true. If I'm crazy for even thinking that, I would appreciate that feedback as well.Summary:

Summarize: What I wish: Any fucking Gundam series!! What I expect: Something else. Let's be honest here, there are many awesome anime that could be chosen but it's probably not going to be a really popular/newish one like Attack on Titan or Dragon Ball Z Kai considering Toonami's current budget. I'm not getting my hopes up for anything mindblowingly awesome. Plus I'm not really familiar with who has the distribution rights to what so I'm just guessing blindly here. One that I saw recently that would fit in well with the line up is Fate/Zero, but I don't think there's a dub for it yet. I haven't seen Fairy Tale, from what I've been told it's sort of a mashup of One Piece and Soul Eater, which sounds awesome. Hell I wouldn't be mad if they aired Death Note again! That one's always popular. Madoka's another one that people would go apeshit for, but if that happens I'll eat my hat. Also what are the odds they get Gurren Lagann?Summary:

Summarize: I'm a member of the lost generation. I like the argument you've given for regarding our individuality as truly special, and the importance of recognizing the dignity of autonomy and choice we all have. I find the core message you have, of ignoring the wishes other people have for us to be subservient, to be good. It reminds me of Tao Te Ching S 56.3 . It is hard to speak to generalities, but my generation, like many before, are disengaged with the slow and conservative systems of social change you encourage. Traditional journalism, politics, law. I dont see this as short-sighted, but as the lost generation [playing to our strengths]( I quite liked Alton Sun's phrasing, that we have a "high activation energy threshold" for activism. We have wised up to wasting our time shouting into deaf ears, and are more interested in finding new ways to boycott a product, vote with our feet, and let the old industries die out trying to woo us back. We can't win a waiting game against those in power. Outspend them in swaying public opinion. We can't fight those systems on their turf, not primarily. Youth-dominated sectors of the economy show where our strengths lie. I encourage my peers to put their effort there, and not be too hard on themselves for the resistance they encounter pushing back against the ways we have been shoved asied. What is curious to me is you don't say why it is worth calling out lies, fighting wall street corruption, or running for local office. Implicitly in our subscribing to the lost generation subreddit we are interested in the issues of growing up in an unlucky cohort: how to handle, logistically, emotionally, culturally being saddled by debt, underemployed, and so on. Engaging with the system, being an activist, a freedom fighter, these are good for the passionate, but for the disengaged these rallying cries are hollow. We don't need to prove Sean Hannity wrong, and we don't want to spend our lives seeking retribution against the corrupt bankers of J.P. Morgan, or politicians, or anyone else. We'd rather be happy than right. I appreciate the rallying cry that just because "they" call us lost doesn't mean we are lost. I just don't think the right measure of whether we are "found" to be against the rubric of success of your generation. Cultural "Failure to Launch" is decrying youths not moving out, having stable careers, having roommate-free living situations, having a wife, and having kids before 30. But I don't think there is anything wrong with disagreeing that these are the measures of adulthood anymore. Career failure to launch, on the other hand, couldn't be less of an "us vs them" generational problem. The entire country benefits from removing agism, both against the retirement age generation, and against the young. See this [analysis from the WSJ]( Young women have outpaced young men in the last decade in finding work, largely because young women have been better at completing post-seconday education. Despite this, young women are still doing worse than in the 90s at career advancement and stability. Feminist authors, notably Susan Estrich, have studied the problem of young working professional women suffering in their careers, and attributes this in large part to failing to engage with their older female counterparts for mentorship and advice. In America especially there is a lack of cultural capacity to view the career potential of women as equivalent to men and simultaneously recognize the different personal challenges women encounter. To Wall Street women are still men who don't go bald and sometimes get pregnant.Summary:
Summarize: Hey, I'm a non binary AMAB dude who has identified as such for nearly two years. I never really explored my gender during that time, or expressed it - I was very comfortable to just acknowledge that I felt this way, but I would occasionally have periods of dysphoria. A few months ago, I moved to a new city, and ever since have been experiencing gender dysphoria very frequently. I would see women on the train or the street that fit my aesthetic/style, and would feel attraction; but as time went on, I started to feel like that feeling was lesser so attraction, but perhaps envy. Dysphoria became a pretty constant thing for me, and I started to think might be a girl. I talked to friends and roommates, who all encouraged me to experiment as I saw comfortable; my nails are now always painted (although playing guitar makes them chip almost instantly), I regularly wear tights under my jeans, and I've started shaving my legs. My family and larger group of friends is aware of this, and don't seem to mind/notice. Within the closer circle that were aware of my dysphoria, I occasionally wear the couple dresses and skirts I have, and go by they/them pronouns. With every step I've taken - shaving, painting nails, wearing dresses - I've felt very comfortable with the results. That said, I've still never really felt a desire to present 100% feminine; I liked how I looked as a dude in a dress with painted nails and stubble. Earlier today, however, I took off my shirt, and I caught myself thinking how the image I saw would be better with breasts. I don't really know what that means, but I thought about it and figured it was as good a reason as any to experiment with presenting even more feminine than I have. Unfortunately, I'm aware I have some very masculine features - a very broad jaw and generally defined face for instance. Some of my features, however, like my weak shoulders and hourglass figure, can be interpreted as more feminine. So,Summary:
Summarize: I find it demeaning and patronising, as a man, that society thinks that I need to be reminded what rape is, and not to do it. Well, I find it demeaning and patronising, as a woman, that society thinks that I need to be reminded what rape is, and not to be raped. This is satire and that's exactly what you missed, maybe because you've never been handed a "how not to be raped" list at a college orientation or in an email forward, or in a women's bathroom stall that it is an almost exact copy of? You've never had the experience of being told how to behave to avoid someone sticking their penis in you without your permission so when the exact same "advice" is flipped to put the responsibility back in the hands of the rapist you get all offended. Too bad. Yes, we need to educate people how to protect themselves, but often the message that this "advice" sends is that you can prevent being raped, so if you are raped it's your fault for failing to be vigilant enough. This image is saying "No, it's always the rapist's fault, let's focus our efforts on blaming rapists and not victims."Summary:
Summarize: So here's the story. I was in a long term relationship with the girl of my dreams for a year, that ended near the end of January. Then it was the standard on/off let's hook up sometimes and play emotional games with each other up until very recently. Her leaving me absolutely wrecked me. I was in a dark cloud of loneliness and depression and it was all I could see. Then I met my current gf. We went on a few dates and hung out for around a month then became official last week. But suddenly I'm starting to realize that I may not actually have feelings for this girl. She is kind, smart, sweet, helps me out, does everything I could ever need. But I don't think I feel the romantic feelings for her that she does for me. I thought I did when someone was finally showing me some affection again, but now it's really feeling more like she's just my friend. I don't feel any butterflies or romantic inclination. Here's the problem, in my stupid depressed stupor she told me she loved me and I said it back (I know I know). I feel like I should break it off and try to maintain a friendship, but I've already invested a lot in this in a short period and I'm feeling overwhelmed because she's a great person and I really don't want to hurt her. She got me a job and wants me to meet her parents tomorrow. We have sex and I'm just not into it. It feels like I'm banging a friend and it's just weird for me. And I'm really not physically attracted to her. I keep trying to convince myself that feelings will grow because of how awesome she is. She is everything my ex wasn't and I know that I should feel something but it's just not happening. I know it's not fair to her but I'm so afraid of hurting this sweetheart of a woman that I'm holding onto the notion that maybe something will bloom. I've read that feelings and attractiveness can grow from friendship. But I just don't feel it. I want someone exactly like her, with all of her qualities. But for some reason it's just not clicking with her. I don't want this to get so deep that I crush her. But I also don't want to give up the notion that since she's so perfect, I'll start to have romantic feelings for her. The truth is, even though it wasn't a healthy relationship and we'll never be together again, I'm still not over my ex. That wound is still open and it's not fair to my current lady. Can anyone offer some advice?Summary:
Summarize: I've been waiting to share this story since I joined Reddit. It's a bit of a novel but to this day my words and actions are checked because of this event. All having to do with an event that happened back in the 5th grade day... I had come home from school one day and overheard one of my friends using the word prostitute (I think it was a South Park episode that he had watched). So I, being the naive sheltered kid started using the word and soon enough it had become an integrated part of my vocab. I was at a golf camp that summer for kids ages 8-14. I was playing a match against my friends little 8 year old brother and when something would not go my way I would say "Wow... what a gay prostitute." I had called him a "gay prostitute" a bunch of times throughout the course of the round, not really thinking anything of it because hey, I had no idea what it meant and they were just words. Fast forward two days later... I'm in my room building the Imperial Tie Fighter lego kit and I hear my mom SCREAM my name from downstairs telling me to get downstairs immediately. The usage of the middle name was the dead giveaway that I was FUCKED, but I digress. I see both of my parents at the foot of the stairs and my Dad looks me dead in the eyes and says: "So you think you're a big tough guy huh?" I replied with a shaky "What?" to which he responded "Don't give me that 'What' shit" (my parents don't swear so this was a huge 'this is how I die' moment). My mom was crying and told me to get in the car. She told me she had received a call from my friends dad who told me the little brother had been brooding in his room since that day. His dad asked him what was wrong and he asked his dad what a "gay prostitute" was. They had to have a family meeting to discuss what had happened, decided to notify the golf course of the event, and notify my parents. We drove 4 minutes down the road to his house where his entire family were outside waiting for me. I have never been so sorry about anything in my whole life. Those two words had ruined his innocence. I cried in front of his whole family and my mom and begged them to forgive me. Which they did. I also got a call from the Head Pro saying she wanted to have a meeting with me and told me that her initial reaction was she wanted to bar me from playing in the rest of the camp but his family kindly said that was a little extreme. Looking back on this event it I know this 100% changed me and helped make me who I am today. I've bumped into them a couple of times since (no longer living by me) and I feel so awkward and awful many years later. I wish I could take those words back but younger me needed a reality intervention quick.Summary:
Summarize: Well, I don't have too much experience, but here are some reasons for myself: I work hard at being flexible, accomodating, considerate, and generous in my every day life, and also have some anxiety issues, so it's nice to a small mental break (only at the most supperfucial level, obviously) from constantly thinking how best to balance my needs and those of another, because I love to tease abd making them feel good makes me feel good, so there is no 'balancing' required as there is no conflicting needs or wants, everything just lines up :) As per above, I do enjoy being bossy and in charge / in control, but usually don't express that part of my personality since in most interpersonal contexts it's inconsiderate if not downright disrespectful. I like to take care of people and be nurturing, and having my 'focussing solely on what will make the other person feel good (that I want to do)' time within the context of a scene helps alleviate some of my fears that 'what I can for another person / what nice feelings I can give them' will be the thing they value most about me / our relationship. The idea of someone being teased, physically and verbally, to the point that they can't think about anything else but what is and what they wished was happening to them right now, is incredibly sexy to me. As a teenager and after, I was sexually harassed, molested, and assaulted several times. I like being a top because I like feeling more in control of what happens to me in a sexual encounter - it helps me relax and be in the moment, rather than anxious, or dissociated. It also allows me to organically limit the kinds of touches (hands on my breasts or groin) most likely to result in anxiety/dissociation, because I get to be in charge, and not letting someone do a thing they really want to is a big part of the whole point of teasing games :) I also find the idea of annoyance/irritation/frustration being converted into, or resulting in repressed sexual desire really sexy, but obviously that's not a particularly healthy dynamic to have outside of a scene. With prior arrangement and negotiation and scripting though, it is totally possible to have someone annoy me on purpose, have me ovverreact and get mad on purpose, and then have me semi-roughly have my way with them, and instead of being traumatic it can be awesome. (Note that I am a total switch for this kind of scene, because I find the whole situation hot, regardless of which role I'm playing in it.)Summary:

Yet another societal degenerate to further taint society, fill our prisons, or become a ward of the state. And since they wont have any sense of moral or upstanding upbringing, they are going to reproduce. Way sooner than they should, and the cycle repeats.... People should have to complete an application process for a BIRTH LICENSE. If you dont meet the requirements, automatic mandated abortion. Poor? Denied. Multiple felon? Denied. Still in high school, or didnt finish school? DENIED!! And don't even get me started on any religion that is against birth control! Are you fucking kidding me? Do you really think god wanted our parasitic species to produce randomly encountered offspring, that the parents don't care about and nobody wants to deal with? Serioulsy! Do the world a favor! Don't use it as birth control, but---- IF you know you arent ready for a child, and it is going to ruin your life and the child's life, ABORT! Potential father a drug addict? Loser? Doubt he's gonna be around? Tell your hormones to FUCK OFF, and do what's right. And how bad is it? I'm a male, I was the only male who stayed in the waiting room that day, surrounded by females of varying status. I figured that WAS THE LEAST I could do to put my g/f through that shit. She had to deal with the bulk of the emotional and physical stress. And yeah, it might weigh on your conscience, but do what we did. Get a pet. Im not joking even a little bit. It helped so much, and we put all our love into that pet and gave it a happy home. Ill never forget it, but I'd never take back what we did so as not to ruin 3 lives, especially 1. And for all of you girls who think "I know it's gonna be hard, but I'm gonna do it because I know I can!" Think again. The same female said that to me when it happened again, even after we used protection, and lived 400+ miles from each other. I told her she was an idiot, and I wanted no part. I told her she had no idea what she was doing, and could NOT do it alone. I told her she was biting off more than she can handle. She told me she didnt want me in the child's life, and I need do nothing. Ok!. (I was young, and didnt care..) 6 months later(post birth)- "Oh my god you have no idea how this is!!! I can't do this alone!" This was the conversation we had b/c I called her b/c I received the child support income garnishment order. Told her so. And now, a few years later, she is married, has a second child, and still can't afford it. I pay her $500 a month for MY child, and she constantly asks me for more money, because her and her husband STILL can't pay the bills. Even though they have all the nicest electronics money can buy, they are late on the electric bill... But wait!! There's more! For only 1 monthly payment of $500 you can NOT see your child! I wasn't active in my child's life for a while. A mistake, and I'll never get those precious years back. But now I'm trying, and she is refusing to let me see the child, because her husband "isn't comfortable with it," even though I'm the biological father. Guess what?!? A horrible lawsuit is about to ensue, per me... Other than me being in the child's life, nothing beneficial is going to come of this, it's only going to hurt my kid to have to go through this. Soooo, sure, go ahead, have that kid that you "think" you can handle..Summary:
Summarize: Hey guys, hopefully someone can help me out here. My roommate, who is also one of my best friends, recently broke up with a girl that I have had a crush on for some time now. I was friends with both of them and trying to be a nice guy, I offered to talk to her and make sure she was doing alright. I soon found out though, that the feelings I had for her, were mutual. My roommate suspects this, and I do not have the heart to tell him because I am worried that he will harm himself. What should I do? Am I completely wrong for having feelings for this girl? Is he being immature for wanting to control the whole situation? Any input would be greatly appreciated!Summary:
Summarize: Being depressed is a really awful thing. You shut down and stop being so outgoing. If you're already an introvert people don't notice what has happened because its a series of really small changes to your lifestyle. But that's the key. No one notices. And that nasty little voice starts echoing in the back of your mind and you recognize it. But by now you're trapped. you've forgotten how to live without depression and you begin sabotaging your own attempts to beat it. Your failures are the only thing that echo in your mind. "You're worthless" you tell yourself, "You can't succeed at anything." Your hobbies and passions lose their luster and stop being enjoyable. You're filled with despair and crippling sense of loss and defeat with no way out.Summary:
Summarize: My friend and I where dancing on a glass table at a house party, one of our slightly more sober friends saw how this could end badly so told us to get down. He took my hand and sort of put his hand under my arm to help me step down onto a chair. The chair toppled over and in and attempt to stop me falling he tensed gripping my arm. My shoulder dislocated and I fell on the floor. Had a med student friend pop it back in and spent the rest of the night with my arm in a makeshift sling. Hurt like a bitch when I sobered up.Summary:
Summarize: It's okay, I had a friend last semester who was browsing reddit in class and saw a harmless "Happy Easter!" post on the front page. He pulls it up in the MIDDLE OF CLASS and it is none other than a massive throbbing dick. I watched the reaction of him quickly putting his hands over the screen as I'm trying to not fall out of my desk laughing while he tries to figure out what to do next. I was also not the only one who saw, because the girls around me started laughing as well.Summary:
Summarize: I have a similar experience. I don't 'do' horror much, I have a very vivid imagination and slip into books very easily. Knowing this, I still get in odd moods and start reading nosleep stories as night falls.. I have yet to not make it to dawn, still reading and refusing to look towards my window or the three doors to my room, none of which are lockable and rattle due to drafts all the time.Summary:
Summarize: I know, i was one of them when i was young. We played mostly RTS, Quake, RtCW, Kingping, UT, Ghost Recon, Doom, FF ecetera back then. My brother is 6 years older, and i game with him since i can, so i always knew how to behave irl and online, since i enjoyed good education in contrast to others i've met online in this new age. Swearing, insulting, tbagging, all of it, besides im sick of it too, doesnt matter for me really. Such people, unable to speak proper english, are mostly childish, super lazy and unable to do RP (because this fucking generation has no sense of fantasy anymore, they tack their eyes 40+ hours a week on yt&netflix) and its the biggest thing in their life to imitate people from yt, because they have zero sense of creativity and personality, and they even feel good about it. Man i hex hacked Diablo2 when i was like 11 (like everyone else did), i mapped with 12 for CS, and had my first own HL Mod with 15. OFC these examples are modest accomplishments, but thats the kind of way i would hope people would quarry with video games. Sometimes i think about doxxing that people, and send their parents the record of their kid going rabid on some voicechat. Hopefully they'll loose daddys machine, and proably even get a slap. Everytime i encounter such people im disgraced. I really think its a wide spread mental disorder. Kids, who shut up IRL all the time, and pretend their thug life online, just because they have no balls to enjoy their RL properly? I feel sorry for them! I played DayZ from the first week on, and i saw what happened to it. Thats why i sometimes wish, vidya wouldn't be that popular. I had no problems being tagged as a "gamer nerd". ADD: Besides, those are kind of people who label themselfes as "the biggest fan" of some ytdude, and using addblock+ all the time.Summary:
Summarize: What I wish: Any fucking Gundam series!! What I expect: Something else. Let's be honest here, there are many awesome anime that could be chosen but it's probably not going to be a really popular/newish one like Attack on Titan or Dragon Ball Z Kai considering Toonami's current budget. I'm not getting my hopes up for anything mindblowingly awesome. Plus I'm not really familiar with who has the distribution rights to what so I'm just guessing blindly here. One that I saw recently that would fit in well with the line up is Fate/Zero, but I don't think there's a dub for it yet. I haven't seen Fairy Tale, from what I've been told it's sort of a mashup of One Piece and Soul Eater, which sounds awesome. Hell I wouldn't be mad if they aired Death Note again! That one's always popular. Madoka's another one that people would go apeshit for, but if that happens I'll eat my hat. Also what are the odds they get Gurren Lagann?Summary:
Summarize: So, my boyfriend of seven months and I moved in together back in November. It was pretty fast, but neither of us regret it, and our relationship is pretty solid. We've been learning of one another's quirks and working out the rougher edges of our relationship without much trouble, expect one: I've got a really high sex drive, and his seems to be taking a backseat. In January we moved out of a shared house where people were coming into our room and stealing from us when we were gone, into a house with some other people that promptly turned into a much worse situation. Long story short, we moved out on the 18th after moving in on the 1st, and by the 14th, the boyfriend was sleeping fully dressed so he could be prepared for any incidents that broke out overnight. When we got out of the house, there were three cop cars and no fewer than eight cops supervising so we could leave safely. Add money tightness and the fact that we're both in school, and you get the idea of how stressful January was for us. Because of that, I haven't been pushing very hard for sex because I don't want to add onto his immediate responsibilities. Now we live together in our own apartment, and things are mostly pretty great. He's the most affectionate he's ever been, and we're happy together, and confident in the other's affections. I know he loves me, and he knows I love him. The only problem is that I can't remember the last time he fucked me sober. Usually we'll have sex after a night of drinking, and it'll be awesome. He's an amazing lover. But afterwards, I'll be lucky if he even looks at me sexually for another five days. Last Sunday, I had to take a break from coitus to go pee, and when I came back he claimed he was too tired to continue even though we'd only been at it for ten minutes and I was all revved up. He promised he'd make it up to me the next night, but it wasn't until we went drinking the following Wednesday that he did. That was the last time we had sex. Since then I try to give him lots of warning. I'll wake up in the mood and try to coax him slowly into being into it by that night. I'll send him dirty texts, and sexy pictures, I walk around the house in my sexiest underwear and make it very, very clear that I'm doing it to entice him, but it seems like he always has an excuse these days. He's tired. He has to work early. He has homework. He just wants to sit and play video games for a while before bed. Last night he cited homework as the reason, and spent 30 minutes on imgur before he actually got started. I had to remind him the reason he didn't want to have sex before he actually started working. In addition, the night before, he decided to stay out until two in the morning drinking with his friends when his original plan was to come straight home at 6 and do homework all night. The other night when he came home at 2, I was still up and we hung out and chatted for a long time. He admitted something's up with him, and we came to the conclusion that he's kind of depressed, and having something of an existential crisis. He gave me this big sincere rant about how beautiful I am and how much he loves me, and it was sweet and made me feel better temporarily, but he had already told me earlier that night to stop sending him dirty pictures, because he really doesn't know how to react to them. He says I'm gorgeous and that he's attracted to me, and I understand depression because I've been dealing with it for years, but the fact that I'm literally shaking my butt at him in the kitchen and he ignores it is starting to get to me. He used to be really into me, and we had sex all the time, but he never just decides he wants me anymore, and it's making me question myself. How am I supposed to feel 100% confident and beautiful when my boyfriend never takes the initiative to fuck me? When he has to be drunk to take any interest? I have no idea how to broach this subject without making him feel like I'm emasculating him. I know intellectually that he's going through something as he approaches his 30th birthday, and that I need to be patient, but I can't talk about it without my feelings of insecurity immediately taking hold. I want to help him with whatever he's going through, but I can't let our sex life take the back seat anymore. How do I have this conversation with grace? Halp.Summary:
Summarize: I was in Atlantic City for my friends 21st birthday. He got obliviously drunk so I decided I was going to do my own thing, play the games I want and not deal with him. This is after I told myself that I would NEVER attend another 21st birthday because its the same bullshit over and over. So I bounce and play some craps. Im shooting dice well and I get a call from him, I pick up and he asks "Should I buy coke?" And of course I say "yes" and he tells me to go back to the room. So I run upstairs, run down the hallway, open the door to the room to find my friend and 2 random, thug ass, black dudes with crazy jewelry on. Now these dudes towered myself and my buddy by inches and Im 6 ft tall. So I act cool and buy some blow. I questioned the quality of the blow and their tone of voice became very aggressive and they became very jumpy. The guy holding then took out a credit card and shoveled this coke up my nose. It tasted terrible and was cleary cut with dog shit and didnt get me high, especially with the amount they jammed up my nose. Just to get them out if my face we bought a gram for $60 snd they got out of there. Before they left, they questioned my earrings. I told them they were purchased at Walmart for 12.99, which they were, and he grilled them sooooo hard. I thought he was gonna start robbing us. They would have gotten away with it, too. Then we blew the dawg shit coke, trying to convince ourselves that it wasnt beat. So then my friend locked his wallet in the room lock box, and wasnt able to open it for an hour, due to the fact ge kept putting in the wrong pin code. Thats when I left him alone in the room and I went back to the craps table.Summary:
Summarize: Hi, so my gf and I ran into a rough spot today. We've talked about it extensively and found that our problem is two-fold: She has very high expectations of how anyone in her life should behave, which is really "What would I do?" But no one else has her past experiences/upbringing, so her expectations almost are never met, both from me and from her friends. I've never had a lot of common sense. I do things and say things that go against common sense (my fuckup today was answering an unexpected door bell without asking who it was). This can sometimes be innocuous, but other times can lead to dangerous situations that would affect her and I negatively. We are moving to a bigger city, supposedly Atlanta, soon (I go up in August, she joins me after fall semester completes). With this big step in our future looming, she's not sure that I can protect her if I do dumb things that can jeopardize our safety. I fell back on being defensive during our discussion this morning and said she was being paranoid, but she and I both know that erring on the side of caution doesn't make one paranoid. So, my question is: how do we manage her expectations better and how do I get common sense? There's got to be somewhere in the middle. Since we've identified the problem, we just want help identifying the solution(s).Summary:
Summarize: I once dated a redheaded JAP (Jewish American Princess) who lived up to every inch of the stereotype, despite being a scant five feet tall. I date her in high school. Her mother started involving herself in 'our' lives and my personal life through abuse and manipulation. My mother was of the same ilk, and despite being 17, I did not tolerate it. I sure as hell didn't tolerate it from someone else's parent and had a calm, polite talk with the daughter about what was going on. I made my stance clear, and when I, and I quote, "didn't want to date [her mother], too," calmly left with more verbal abuse from both parents. LOLOLOL. So, years later, we cross paths again. By this time, the mom had gotten hooked on various narcotics and was out of the daughter's life. It's a small town, and we knew many of the same people, and I always do my homework when it's reasonably possible, so I had confirmed all this before our first date. And, given the history, I had gone to more depths than the ARP (Average Reasonable Person Standard). Apparently I didn't research deeply enough... After some short interim of relationship status, I found out she lied to my face about being clean. She had herpes. Certainly not the end of the world, and fairly preventable, but she lied about it, and we had had considerable unprotected sex. (I get tested every six months, for the record, and I'm still clean.) When I confronted her about it, she admitted to it, said she didn't think I would've dated her if she told the truth etc. I politely heard her out and left. So she had her pregnant friend pee on a pregnancy test, then took the photo and sent it to me. I told her she could see me in court for alimony after a DNA test. I also told her I'd fight to have sole custody of the kid, given her considerable drug abuse in the past, her lack of job, etc. When that didn't work, she threatened physical harm of me. When that didn't work, she knew my mother had committed suicide, so she threatened to kill herself. I was completely OK with this, and told her to go ahead and do so. When that didn't work, she drove around town with her friends trying to stalk me and/or beat me up, while all of her friends harassed me over the phone. Eventually, I got fed up with the situation to talk to my boss who kindly let me purchase a cell phone through work. And, since I worked at a law office, was kind enough to take a few of the calls himself and give out cease and desist notices. The calls quickly stopped, and I thought it was all over, until she and her friends saw me walking with my friends downtown one night. My car was usually parked in the same spot (I get lost easily), so she knew where to look. So my friends and I played a game of tag. We would camp out in the spots where we could view the approaches to my known hangouts. We were out of sight, and she was not. Of the three spots we watched, she drove by each of them at least once that night. Mind you, all this happened over the course of several months.Summary:
Summarize: So a very non-technical user brought to me his laptop and printer because he couldn't print. After a few days of reformatting/updating his laptop because it was too far gone from viruses I finally take a look at his printer. It keeps saying "Carriage Jammed" so I'm checking for jams and can't figure out why it is stuck. I then pick up the printer and flip it over to see if there's anything visibly jammed on the back/bottom. I hear rattling... weird... so I open the printer and shake and out falls dry dog food. Not just a few pieces, at least a HANDFUL of dry dog food. What?! How does a handful of dog food get INSIDE of a printer?! He is now happily printing.Summary:
Summarize: He's a troll. Look through the full two days of comments he's made and it is crystal clear. Hell, just look at his name. And should he actually be from Texas, which I doubt, then I apologize on behalf of the rest of Texas. It is clear someone moved a rock somewhere and this slithered out. Your average Texan does not hold such ridiculously ignorant views. We are generally a progressive, accepting people. The problem comes from the fact that those progressive, accepting people don't go around shouting their views or trying to force their views on others. We are typically live and let live. But those that hold toxic views feel the need to spread those toxins. They do so in the most obnoxious and disputable ways and that unfortunately leaves the rests of us looking bad, too. Now, do we have assholes? Of course! Texas is 268,500 square miles or 695,621 square kilometers and we border four states. Assholes are bound to happen.Summary:
Summarize: So this past week I was responsible for teaching a new hire at work, we'll call her Janet. During the second day, we started hitting it off and talking about our lives and found out we had a lot of similarities. I thought about asking her out, but hesitated. While dating a co-worker isn't explicitly forbidden, it is definitely frowned upon, especially one that I was "mentoring." I have also been known to misread signals sometimes, so I didn't want to risk possible getting in trouble AND rejected at the same time. I spent a few days thinking and decided, "Fuck it, I'm going to go for it." I knew Janet would be at an another co-worker's house tonight for a housewarming party, and I would make my move then. I got to the house and immediately sought her out, we started to flirt, but something was a little off/awkward. There was a guy hanging around her really close, and a little defensively. A mutual friend that had gotten pretty close with Janet noticed, and pulled me aside. She asked I was interested in Janet, and I told her I was, but I was getting weird vibes. She told me that Janet was talking about me all last week, and was definitely interested, but felt like she was getting mixed signals from me. She said Janet was getting a little depressed about, and to cheer her up, she took Janet clubbing 2 days ago and introduced her to a guy friend. That was the guy at the party, and they apparently hit it off pretty well. It became an awkward situation for me cause the guy came to the party for Janet, so she couldn't really ditch him, and for only knowing each other a couple days they were surprisingly close already. My friend apologized and said that if she had know that I was for sure interested, she wouldn't have set her up with another guy. So this is where I'm left. I do legitimately like this girl, and it is actually pretty rare for me to find someone I'm interested in. Do I just drop it issue? Hope that she and the new guy burn out quickly? Or should I tell her that I was in fact interested, but I didn't know how to handle the situation since we work together?Summary:
Summarize: I don't think anyone will remember, but last time I posted I was on the verge of graduating. Well I finally got my engineering degree, but up to today my wife and I were still living with Nmom, grandfather, step dad, and my 2 GC brothers. In that time Nmom has kept up with the insults towards my wife and hasn't said anything to her except when she has criticism. Usually along the lines of "you need to wash the dishes/you need to clean/you're lucky you stay here for free." I'd also like to mention that Nmom has the same attitude towards me, but to a lesser degree. In fact, lately she has been talking to me. I do talk to her because I've been trying to avoid problems with her. I tell my wife how we just need to suck it up until the end of the year (by then we should have enough money to get our own place. Right now we're looking for a car since I have to commute to an engineering job and wife has to commute to her college where she received a full-ride scholarship.) Basically, the only real tension in our lives has been NMom, the arguments my wife and I have over her, and how much I work since I still have my retail job in efforts to save enough to move out. This past week was bad. NMom approached my wife while I was working and lectured her on how to be a good wife and how she was failing her duties to me (make lunch/dinner, etc. For the record, I do not share the same views as my NMom and although I do appreciate my wife helping I do not expect it since she has priorities in school.) NMom has also started throwing away our things. The past few weeks I have noticed things disappearing from our room but didn't know NMom was going inside the room until my wife told me. Today it was our dustpan and toys we had for our kittens. Both were in the trash. When I confronted NMom her response was "Maybe your wife is throwing things away and trying to frame me! I saw her running to the trash with a bag RIGHT before you came home!" Today NMom waited until after I dropped my wife off at work and I returned home. She asked me to go to the kitchen where my grandfather was waiting. She then started telling me how the entire house was a mess and my wife refused to clean. (My wife does refuse to clean certain things. NMom has told her several times to clean up after everyone. She has never made either GC clean. The one GC who came out of jail flat out refuses to clean and tells NMom "Leave me alone you bitch, etc.") She also blamed urine on the restroom floor on my wife when its actually her husband. He pees in bottles in the room and usually misses the toilet on the rare occasion he decides to use it. She also said I left my clothes in the washer and they were beginning to smell. (They were left in the washer because NMom is "redmodeling" it. This means she literally drags the dryer outside everyday and only drags it inside when she wants to wash. When she doesn't drag it in we don't use it. The clothes were left because she took the dryer outside when she finished using it. For. Some reason she leaves the washer inside.) Basically she continued trashing my wife for 15 minutes until she said "I have to leave, I have an appointment." I told her to sit back down and I began to tell her how its unfair the GC don't have to do anything, come home drunk, and have friends over who make noise well into the a.m. when my wife and I are the only ones in the house who work and have to be up early. I told my grandfather how NMom has been throwing my things away, insults my wife, etc. NMom ended up getting up and leaving and I yelled at her for it. I continued to tell my grandfather how she was bending the truth and didn't like my wife and went out of her way to make us feel not at home. His response was "If you don't like it you can start packing, but you are making it hard on NMom." I told him I would be out by the end of the week. I called my aunt to ask if I could borrow her truck to move our things to a storage unit; she said yes and also told my aunts what was happening. I have aunts on my side who have offered us a place to stay but it wouldn't be ideal since they're all very similar to my NMom in attitude (the aunt who offered us a room used to turn off the hot water and electricity when she felt we were wasting it e.g. showering for more than 5 mins.) God I hate NMom right now but I think I cab make it as long as my wife supports me. I've never had support from NMom and my wife is the first person who has ever really cared for me like this.Summary:
Summarize: I cant be the only one who just didn't play launch night because the got tired of a bugged prologue after 2 hours. And now I'm posting after wasting time replaying the prologue and then all the end cut scenes were completely black due to another bug. What a waste of time, Gearbox should expect some people to have played the beta and expect some people to not need a tutorial. If I wanted story I would have picked the prologue, and as much as I appreciate Gearbox's humor I wish I had that time back. Don't corner me with this unskippable bullshit. And the best part is those who actually liked the prologue could choose to do it, if they wished and I could have quit out and ignored it after trying it.Summary:
Summarize: I don't wear a helmet on my commute to class, but I still think this article is bullshit. The whole thing is founded on the idea that when you wear a helmet you ride more recklessly. This notion seems not only ridiculous, but completely unfounded. I would imagine that, even if there was a very small increase in the number of accidents when everyone wore a helmet compared to no one wearing one, the large increase in severity of the accidents would show how stupid this article is.Summary:
Summarize: That's exactly why he's a pedantic little bitch. He knows, or should know if he's even half as clever as he thinks he is, that the advert is referring to vigor and vitality but takes petty delight in calling them stupid by assuming or pretending that they're referring to chemical energy. In his mind he's right because obviously they meant chemical energy. The reason they obviously meant that is because that would make him right and them wrong. That would make him clever. Maybe if he points out these "mistakes" often enough then the loneliness will go away.Summary:
Summarize: Hello Reddit. I made a similar post in /r/askgaybros but everyone just generally told me to stop being a slut and use condoms. I figured I would try here and see if I could get better clarity / direction on what I should do. My confession is simple. I'm 22 and I've had sex with 193 guys, and more often than not, condoms wouldn't be used. I genuinely don't want to be in this situation. Let me start from the beginning. I used to be on gay chatrooms and whatnot as a kid (remember Mogenic? lol). Anyway, I ended up meeting a guy when I was 15. He was 20 or so. We just chilled and one thing led to another and we did it. Goodbye virginity! I don't regret it but I might have acted differently in hindsight. So first in addressing the sex element. I would sneak out and have sex with guys, until I was 18 and would be able to leave home without any issues (I couldn't before because I was doing my Year 12 / HSC study / still was in school). I don't know what it is, I just like sex. I like it when guys fuck, I like it when we make out. I just like feeling wanted. I'm not sure if it's a sex addiction or something, but there have been days before where I would just lie in bed and do nothing but "the deed" consecutively , by myself of course; maybe 4-5 times before I get up out of bed? It's weird. Once I'm determined / in this sexualised state, nothing will stop me from achieving what I want. In the past I've driven 2 hours away to meet with a guy, even sneaking out in all hours of the morning, i.e. midnight to like 3AM. I've had one night where I slept with three different guys in the same night. I don't know why I do it, apart from it feeling good. I just know if I'm going to do it, it'll happen. I've ended in some semi-dangerous situations, like meeting guys from Craigslist in a dark park. I was set upon and had to punch / run away. The other bit is the condom bit. The guy that took my virginity didn't use a condom, and neither did most guys I met when I was 15-17. It just never occurred. Like, literally, it was just straight in as is. I did have sex-ed, but maybe it's the Australian system but we just talked about heterosexual sex so I just figured I wouldn't get pregnant, so why bother? It feels good anyway. That kind of thought followed me throughout my teenage years until I hit 18 and realised what had transpired, and I genuinely just assumed I must have HIV. I'm a pretty cluey individual, so I figured, if I never get checked, I'll never be told I have HIV, so then I can tell guys I'm clean because I've never actually had it proven that I had it, so I didn't want to get tested. The other thing was I was still denying my homosexuality at that point in time, despite having been with 50 guys or so. I was in the closet and lied to myself. I tricked myself into being straight. Anyway, don't worry, that phase of my life was short and I did end up getting checked once I found out about these sexual health clinics that you can go to anonymously. First time I went, results came back and I had everything (except HIV and herpes). I was shocked. But I was treated and got over it. For some reason I still slept with guys bareback. I don't know why, it was just normal for me. The other guy would never bring it up so I assumed why not? I'm thinking it's also linked to my lack of self esteem, which meant I really wanted to please the guy so he wouldn't reject me or something. Anyway... moving forward. The same kind of behaviour transpired up until recently. Why you ask? Well, I kinda just realised how stupid I was in doing all this. It was only when I came here on Reddit and explained my story that it made sense. Since I was in the closet, none of my friends knew -- sorry, correction, they were sure I was gay but just played along with it because they didn't want me to get upset. So I didn't have anyone close to tell them about my sex-capades, no-one to judge, no-one to open up to. I had free reign over this "person" that I became, the sex addicted barebacker. Now I'm worried no guy will want me because, I mean, who would? I've been with so many guys. It's embarrassing and makes me sad when I think about it, and I have no idea now it got this bad. I can't feel like I can truly be me around people because I'm scared they will judge me. Someone in the other thread said I was a classic example of behavioural economics, in that, I didn't see the risk in barebacking / didn't care. It's almost subconscious. I just don't understand why I do it / continue to do it (sometimes). The same way I would literally study for an exam the night before even if I had a whole week off. My mind just doesn't want to do what's right for me, it's all about gratuitous pleasure. I guess I don't have much willpower. I don't know who or where to turn to. How do I change? I can see and believe that if I keep this up, I will end up with HIV or something worse. But at the same time I just let all logic fly out the window when I'm making out with a guy and he's about to stick it in. Even worse if I'm on amyl, it's just like "fuck, let's do it". I just don't understand, like FUCK. What is wrong with me?Summary:
Summarize: My mixed primary school didn't have changing rooms. We all just changed into our kits in the classroom. If you forgot your kit you did PE in your pants. As an extremely shy little boy I found this absolutely mortifying. If I was going to expose myself to anyone I insisted it be on my own terms! This resulted in what I can only refer to as some sort of psychological complex where I would wear a pair of sports shorts under my trousers ALL THE TIME . This lasted for years! Then one day, aged 15, I thought "fuck it! I'm sick of this shit!" and did a complete 180 and started going commando! And I've never looked back since!Summary:
Summarize: I cant be the only one who just didn't play launch night because the got tired of a bugged prologue after 2 hours. And now I'm posting after wasting time replaying the prologue and then all the end cut scenes were completely black due to another bug. What a waste of time, Gearbox should expect some people to have played the beta and expect some people to not need a tutorial. If I wanted story I would have picked the prologue, and as much as I appreciate Gearbox's humor I wish I had that time back. Don't corner me with this unskippable bullshit. And the best part is those who actually liked the prologue could choose to do it, if they wished and I could have quit out and ignored it after trying it.Summary:
Summarize: I'm a rather new Redditor and this is not my main account but I need to get some things off my chest, process it all, and maybe get some advice. If this is the incorrect sub I apologise and please tell me where else I can go. I'm a nineteen year old girl from Australia. I was born in Central West New South Wales as the only (that I know) child of two addicts. My father was convicted at fourteen and spent most of his life before I was born as an aggressive and depressed alcoholic and drug dealer. He met my mother when she was in her early 20s and he established himself to my mother and her sister as a dealer. Within a few years he managed to get her to marry him and then dragged her out to a town (population of under 300) in to the middle of the country where the land is almost completely barren, not even the kangaroos would live there. He kept her there for more than a decade, during which time I was born. Through their various rages at me I've learnt from them that she still used coke and ecstasy throughout her pregnancy with me, but mainly used oxycodone^1. My mother left him when I was 18 months but I have vague memories and flashbacks^2 from then of dark rooms, shocking heat and a woman begging and screaming. She managed to escape to the coast on a train and found a women's refuge and managed to sober up enough to get us a dingy unit before my father followed her and found himself somewhere to live nearby. Between the ages of 2 and 5 I was relatively happy but this was really the beginnings of her abuse. I don't particularly think she meant to but she is and was so fucked up by the things that happened to her at the hands of my father and by the drugs themselves (which were evidently more varied than what I've been informed of) that I don't know whether to pity her or not. Between the ages of four and sixteen she forced me into seeing 12 counsellors, 8 psychologists, and 6 psychiatrists. I was diagnosed with depression, social anxiety, ADHD, ADD, Borderline Personality Disorder and manic depression, among other things, and was put on more and more prescription drugs as the time went on. But this was all masking the actual issues, which was that she beat me. She hit me, kicked me, pulled my hair out, forced soap so far down my throat she knocked out some of my teeth, and locked me in my bedroom for days at a time. I've done some reading online and she fits most if not all of the symptoms of Münchausen's Syndrome by Proxy, that she tried to gather sympathy for herself through me and tried to make it look worse by faking and even causing me to have illnesses. This became worse when my father, who refused to leave the city, took her to the family courts and managed to get dual custody of me when I was 7. I spent tuesday nights and even second weekends at his unit before then (from the age of 5), and became used to checking for syringes and broken glass in the grass and it was at that time that I saw my first dead body hunched over on the stairwell to our unit, surrounded by blood. Regardless, he still managed to get dual custody of me because I was more scared of my mother than my father at that point and over the course of that year (2002) I spent equal time between the two hovels. In the summer of 2003 my mother had one of her friends stay for two weeks. This friend and her son (a year older than me) stayed in my room and not only did I have to sleep in my mother's room (sometimes her bed, sometimes the floor), but I wasn't allowed in my bedroom at all. One afternoon I tried to go in my room to pick out a book to read and her friend pushed me out, pushed me against the wall and screamed at me. I started crying, ran into the kitchen and grabbed a knife before slicing into my throat. My mother saw it, called my father, and had him take me away to his house. I didn't see my mother again for close to two years, except for one time I was in hospital.* I had always had hearing difficulties, and my first year with my father doctors found out I had tumours in my head ( NOT brain tumours, they're between the brain and the skull itself) and I had my first operation to remove them then. Since then I've had 5 more surgeries, each time they've more aggressive (to the point of brain fluid leaking on the operating table and weeks in hospital to recover). The time taken to recover from the procedures, as well as other complications^3 has lead me to decide that it's better to live to 35 relatively normally than to 55 and spend half the time in bed and in pain. Essentially, I'm halfway through my life already, and I'm okay with that now. I'm a big girl, and I've had years to make this decision. So between 2003 and 2005 (age 8-10) I lived with my father exclusively and I don't remember much about this period besides vague memories, flashbacks and night terrors, mostly of things he did to me, or things he threatened to. Every couple of weeks he would grab onto my arm and pull me to the front door saying he was taking me 'to buy a box'. This box, he said, would need to be taken care of because as soon as we got home he would pack my clothes into it and drive me to _ , this suburb known for being a red-light district with more murders than births each year, as well as lots of gang activity. He said that within a week I'd be selling myself from this cardboard box, within a month I'd be shooting up inside it, within a year I'd be giving birth inside it, and within a decade I'd be buried inside it in an unmarked grave, as a sign of how worthless I am. That's stuck with me ever since, and it's still hard to process how he could hate his only daughter that much. I also remember him pretending to kill himself in front of me before getting up, cackling with glee, and pinning my hands behind my back and locking me in my room for a few days with just a bucket to piss in, a loaf of bread, and a lettuce. He also... lit my vagina on fire at one point. I don't remember it, I've blocked it out, but I've got burn scars over my vulva. He never told me why but as I've grown up I've worked out that he didn't want me to be able to have casual sex, if any sex at all. I don't know if he molested me, I wouldn't say I know he did, but it wouldn't surprise me given the burns and the fact that when I behaved he would 'reward me' by making me sleep in his bed, and before he went to sleep he'd turn the television to porn channels. I lost my virginity when I was twelve to this boy from school and he showed me that not everyone will hurt me, and I loved that feeling. I lived through it for years. I dropped out of school when I was thirteen because I was already earning a reputation and a group of boys would beat me up (to the point of broken bones) and sexually assault me a couple of times a week. I kept my mouth shut because these boys' parents were friendly with the principal and nobody would believe what I said anyway. But I got fed up eventually and in September 2008 I walked out of class and never went back. It seems that nobody even noticed me missing from school because nobody ever came to check on me. So, I began walking on a bad path, I met some people, had a lot of stupid sex, formed an addiction to it, and I moved drugs on the side for some income. Most of which I had to pay in rent to my mother in order to stay there instead of living on the street again. I was sixteen I overdosed. I'd had enough and really just reeling from some news I'd got a few months before^3. My mother's oxy^1 use (and perhaps the burns as well) had left me sterile. I had believed that I was going to be a mother one day and prove to myself I could be a better parent to my own children than mine were to me, but this was basically a slap in the face, and is one of the reasons I'd rather die at 35 than 55. There's just not that much use in me being alive any longer than that if there's nobody relying on me. Alas, evidently I didn't die then but I felt absolutely crap just looking at where I was in life so I decided to start a course and finish high school. I finish it completely next month, but I've stopped caring about it any more. It just isn't something that caters to my interests, and I'm not any happier now either. However, just before I started my course I met my ex boyfriend, this was mid 2012. We were in different social classes, but I figured he loved me because we had enough in common. I guessed wrong. We were together for more than a year, not that long for most people, but longer than anything I've managed before that. He was sweet, caring, and his family liked me, and I gave him every part of me that I could. But this wasn't enough and he turned obsessive, paranoid, nasty and abusive. Oh, and he cheated on me with another girl, which he used as a reason to break up with me, though that wasn't the reason I was given; which was that apparently his mother had seen me smoking crack, when I'd never even touched the stuff. But I was okay with that, I knew I was better off without him. This was mid 2013. 2013 was a clusterfuck. My grandmother died, my boyfriend dumped me 3 days after my 18th bithday, my dog died a month later and then, the pièce de résistance, I was raped by the man who lives next door to me. This was October 5th 2013. My finals started a week later and I failed all of them because I wasn't able to study, and I had panic attacks during the exams themselves. It's been a year and I still live next to him, and I can't afford to move. The Police said they can't do anything because I have no proof (besides scars) and the only things that are keeping me sane at this point is my other dog (a Great Dane), my best friend (who is pretty much my new boyfriend), my bong, and a bayonet from the First World War which I keep beside my bed to give me some feeling of security. My house caught fire in April, and a few months later the bolts to my screen door were cut. Twice. My mother laughed at me when I told her that I was raped because she likes the guy, but over the past 12 months we've begun to repair our relationship though I'm still wary of her and mainly use her to help me do my grocery shopping because I can't afford a car and this area has too many hills to be able to carry the bags home. On a side note, my mother told me that my father moved to the US (Arizona) in late 2008 and married a banker before beating her, divorcing her, taking her money and fleeing to Mexico. I haven't heard about him in two years, and I haven't spoken to him since early 2008. I know I need therapy, I know I've got problems. I can't sleep unless I'm stoned because of my PTSD^2 and I'm still dealing with sex addiction, but I've recently kicked my cigarette addiction (of a pack a day for around 4 years, and half packs for 3 years) which I've got going for me. Which is nice. I could really do with some advice on what to do.Summary:
Summarize: This guy was pretty much a dick. Right after he blew up on AI, I was actually really impressed with him and his attitude on the show (I think that's what most people liked him for). So of course I tried to cash in on his popularity by selling T-Shirts of him on eBay. It did not say his name, but an outlined image his him raising his fist and it said "She Bangs". It was not condescending at all but relatively flattering I think. Also, I loosely consulted some attorney friends and I was assured there was no copy right issues with this. When I first posted this, there was only 1 other guy selling William Hung buttons on eBay. By the time I was done, there were about 20 pages worth. In the end I sold about 500 shirts (with 100% satisfaction) and made a small profit. When I started selling and it was obvious people wanted the shirt, I wrote an email to WH (found his email address through Berkley directory). I told him what I was doing, and that I had alot of respect for him. Legally I was not obligated to give him squat, but out of respect, I would like to split the profit with him. I thought he would appreciate the gesture, but instead I got a really nasty email in return. I had no idea he was such a dick (completely opposite of what I saw on TV). Basically he demanded that I take down what I was selling on eBay and USED ALOT OF CAPITALS with ungrounded rationales. I knew he had no grounds so I pretty much replied "go fuck yourself". A few weeks later, his lawyer sent me a cease and desist letter. But I was down to my last shirts and wasn't planning on making anymore so I just ignored it. Didn't have time for that BS anyway. Nothing much happened after that, much like his career in show biz. But it figures based on how he really is. (I'm not basing his character just on this incident, but it opened my eyes. There are tons of stories on how retarded he was).Summary:
Summarize: The only way to get HIV is if you let the sperm go into your blood stream, which basically means you have to floss really hard right before you blow him and just let the entire load sit in your mouth for a good 30 seconds. If you swallow, you're safer since your stomach acid burns it all away. If all you did was taste the precum (lick it and sort of have it in your mouth then spit out), I'm 100% you're fineSummary:
Summarize: I don't know if it's intensional, but the bathroom at my job is always freezing cold. It's so bad that I get stressed out when I gotta use it. I end up holding it, which adds more stress. Eventually, I face the fact that not only do I have to walk into that fifty degree tundra-bathroom but I also gotta drop my drawers for about six minutes.Summary:
Summarize: Actually the Koreans have to win to make their money, they do not get the luxuries that many of the western lol players get. CLG and TSM can live of their stream revenue and salary, the teams don´t necessarily need to win anything to get money. There is no incentive to scrim 8 hours a day when they can just stream solo queue and chill all day. Meanwhiles many Korean players probablly don´t even get salary and their teamhouses are nowhere near as luxurious as the NA mansion. They have to win tournaments in order to succeed.Summary:
Summarize: Like the title says. We have a great relationship now, but we caused each other a lot of hurt in the first year or two - we both just fucked up a lot with our communication, and expected too much of each other as neither of us really knew what it was reasonable to expect of someone else in a relationship. For a bit of extra background, I'm his first relationship and I had only ever had one relationship prior, in which I was emotionally and sexually abused. Eventually we hit a point where we realized it was time to either get serious or stop wasting each other's time. We both also had some major trust issues stemming from our respective childhoods. So, off to individual and couples' therapy we went. We worked hard and overcame a lot of issues. Now we're in one of those relationships where you can tick off every "healthy relationship" box - great communication, similar interests, high levels of respect for one another, we have fun together, good chemistry, etc. etc. Except I'm just...not feeling it sometimes. Sometimes I feel totally apathetic about him, even for weeks at a time. It really kills me, because he's genuinely the best friend that I've ever had and I'm really attracted to him. It sounds like there shouldn't be a problem, right? But it seems like when I start to feel too strongly about him I hit a wall and bounce back and then can't feel anything at all. But, when I think about breaking up with him my heart feels like it's going to shatter. A month or so ago, we both went through an incredibly busy period in our jobs where we barely saw each other. We'd both work all day, see each other for a couple minutes before bedtime, then wake up early and leave for work again. Predictably, my apathy rose up again in full force and I also developed a really intense crush on a co-worker. (No, I'm not going to act on it, yes, I realize it's nothing more than an escapist fantasy, yes, I realize that after five years I'd probably be having the same issues with the new guy.) I'm just really confused and sad because our relationship doesn't seem to be rebounding from this rough patch as it should. We're spending time together again, but I just feel so empty and blank and I really want the feelings to come back. I don't know how to talk to him about it because I'm about 90% sure it's my own mental issue, and I don't feel like there's any point in saying "Hey babe, I don't feel like I'm in love with you but there's nothing you can really do about it until I sort out my own shit." Has anyone been in this situation? What do I do?Summary:
Summarize: I've worked on and off in a professional capacity for various sites here and there. The main thing I would tell most people is that finding a job that pays you a livable weekly wage to review 5-6 movies per week is just not going to happen unless you end up writing for a newspaper, which is ridiculously competitive, and of course, once someone has a position they will try and stick with it until they die. I got paid for my film reviewing by "packaging" it with feature work, which is much-less inspired, churned out work. The problem with the film reviewing economy is that these types of articles are always going to earn 10-20x the number of hits/revenue that a review will, so often it seems that the smartest way to earn cash from reviews is by proposing it to editors in the form of a feature-type article (possibly with multiple pages to enhance the click rate). The overwhelming majority of people who attend screenings either do it part time or in a lot of cases work for free. There's a sad contradiction that as long as people are willing to work for free, websites making hundreds of thousands of pounds/dollars per year won't actually pay their staff for reviews, which is of course totally ridiculous. In short: most websites outside of the biggies don't perceive reviews as worthy enough to pay their staff, so simply push the idea of seeing the film early and MAYBE getting to schmooze with a few stars during interviews/at the red carpet as payment enough (when of course, this costs more train fare in of itself, as press junkets are often on different days to the screening).Summary:
Summarize: I'm very sorry that your first thought when seeing a cry for help was to doubt the story, insult a 16 year old girl who's been through utter Hell, and slather on as much sarcasm as you could muster. We are trying every possible avenue in order to find her and give her the help she desperately needs. Reddit is capable of so much good in the world, and has been responsible for some great miracles. It's my hope that maybe one more could be done. I further hope that you never run into a situation where you may feel the need to try something, anything, in order to get help. But if you ever do find yourself there, I hope that you'll never encounter someone as callous as yourself.Summary:
Summarize: Fuck man. It's like... Yahweh said the Jews would get their holy land back in BC. But it took until the fucking 60's before Israel. HP/Valve said we would get silencers back when we were in beta. So, who knows if we will get them tomorrow, or in nineteen hundred years. And even then, we may or may not have to engage in some holy warfare/war crimes.Summary:
Summarize: I had the same problem. I could only cover 3/4 of the screen with the nub. My hands are relatively large, so I don't know if a lot of people are gonna have luck with this. That being said, the thumb straps are pretty cheap, and it's worth a try for anyone having trouble with a stylus. Personally my best solution was to use the extra stylus that came with the DSiXL. It can cover a lot of ground, and comfortably too! And yeah, using pressure from your right hand is the way to bring some of the strain off of your left hand.Summary:

Summarize: So I was adding a video card and new power supply to my old setup (yes its a premade, I know, I know) and realized that my case was too cramped, so I "moved that shit" to a larger case. However, I seem to have run into a problem. I actually do not exactly know where the motherboard hookups (HDD light, reset switch, power switch, "SPEAKER"). I'm currently using the motherboard that comes default with the P7-1132 (model is AAHD3-HB). Does anyone have any advice for this, or maybe an online manual (I've looked for an online manual. The physical manual is no longer with me). Thanks in advance r/TechSupport (or not, whichever is more applicable.)Summary:
Summarize: I'm I the only one who doesn't like this guy? Okay today's copyright schemes are bullshit designed by greedy assholes, but this guy isn't some brave hero or selfless fighter like they are over at the pirates bay. This guy made money off copyrighted material. You cannot complain about copyrights while making money off them to! So let's stop pretending like this guy is just another innocent victim. He made money off other people's backs.Summary:
Summarize: In the last year, I've almost entirely stopped watching television on television. I've made a conscious effort to find shows that have been made specifically to be distributed through the internet using an ad model. I've found some really great shows. Husbands Booth at the end STRIP SEARCH omg, this show is the absolute best - and normally I hate reality television. Tabletop/Geek & Sundry Wigs Scripted content for netflix The guild (although, I had known about this one for a long time) I think it will be a while before I completely ween from network/traditionally distributed shows, but despite their tiny production values, a lot of the writing and acting on these shows is as good or better than what you would find on cable/network. Some of it totally sucks - cringeworthy even - although it's not like there isn't shitty tv on tv. But a lot of it is genuinely good. And people can swear with impunity, which I didn't know bothered me, but after watching Strip Search and hearing people that actually talk like I do in real life, I realized just how artificial the dialog is on most shows. If the distribution companies and major networks are going to be dicks about EVERYTHING and the cable companies have to be dragged kicking and screaming into the 21st century, I say fuck them. I'll do my very best to just cut them out of my entertainment model entirely. I'll find people who are passionate about what they're doing, who are writing great stuff, who aren't total tool bags, and I'll support the hell out of them because they rock. Screw these assholes who are just out to make a buck.Summary:

Summarize: Little backstory: The relationship started out alright until she told me she wanted me to support her financially while she went to every Marilyn Manson concert in the tri-state area and got to sleep with whoever she wanted. I said GTFO and spent the next three months throwing out about a metric ton of her shit that she left in my attic. Fast Forward 5 years: I've finally gotten my shit together and am living in a nice apartment with my little brother who is kind of trying to get his shit together. I'm working midnights at the time so I'm up at about 5:00am playing some Diablo 2 before I hit the sack for the day when my phone rings. This is already weird. It gets weirder when I answer the phone and the first thing I hear is that girl ask me not to hang up immediately and start crying about how she really needs to see me. After much internal debate I decide that after the shit she put me through I deserve an apology, so I agree to meet her for coffee at noon. I'm about to crawl into bed when the phone rings again, this time because my little brother needs to be bailed out jail for being a publicly intoxicated minor. So I bail him out and I go to get coffee without having slept. I meet her and sit down and she starts her tearful apology and ends with a marriage proposal.Summary:
Summarize: why you downvoted me Nice assumptions m8 >Can you justify why it's so important? Almost nobody played the old battlefronts online (aside from PC) because a lot of people played them on consoles. Given that the online console community is far from good, it was probably a good thing that people on consoles played offline because it increased their enjoyment of the game. Hell, it was the only way to enjoy the game. Instant action is also better than online play because its (hence the name) instant, which means the only thing you ever have to wait on is respawning and loading screens. You also never had to worry about your internet connection or whether or not the people playing against you had better internet. Also, since the bots were not the best, it always felt awesome to be the alpha and omega on the battlefield, destroying battalions of enemies, always getting the option to play as a hero. With online play, you have a good chance of being just another average guy with no feeling of specialty or importance.Summary:
Summarize: Not me but my ex. I wasn't there so I would have loved to have watched a video of this. He spilt water on the kitchen floor when he was cooking one night and didn't clean it up right away. A little later, he slips on the water and face-plants on the floor. As he was falling however, his hand hits the counter top and the knife that was sitting near the edge falls off and stabs him in the arse. He then drive to the emergency room on his scooter with a knife in his arse to get stitches. He earned the nickname 'knife-block' after this.Summary:
Summarize: One thing to keep in mind, is that children are just as much beautiful and insightful as they are cruel and vile. Just like adults. Do everything you can to support your daughter's emotional well being. But keep in mind that some kids will be dicks to her because some kids are just dicks. If it wasn't her skin color it would be her clothing or the shape of her nose or sound of her voice. The important thing to keep in mind, IMHO, is that her experiences as a child, good or bad, comforting or painful, will forge her into the woman she will become. And I'm guessing, like most mixed race people I've known, she will grow to be an interesting and thoughtful human as the result of her experiences. Edit:Summary:
Summarize: I once got into an argument with my mom. I had homework to 'send a letter ordering an item from a catalog'. Being a total fucking nerd, I thought 'Great! I was going to order new lead figures for D&D anyway, I'll just kill two birds with one stone'. So, I write out 'Please send me 1 each of item #XXXX, #YYYY, and so on. My mother decides she's going to 'check my homework', and starts going nuts. She tells me I'm doing it wrong because the example we were given was for ordering sweatshirts or some shit, and had colors and all that. It got ugly. She's yelling 'You're supposed to say you want Item X in Yellow, with Red stitching!', and I'm saying 'Mom, you're a fucking retard! They're lead! They only come in one color, you're just ruining my fucking homework! Leave me alone you stupid bitch, you barely got your GED!' She tore up my homework. I never turned it in, or ordered the lead figures. I also never did homework in front of her again, and never showed her my report cards again. She was literally shocked to learn I'd been accepted to college, since she'd assumed I was failing all through school, and too ashamed to show her my report cards from 6th to 12th grade.Summary:
Summarize: Some background: I dated a guy for a few years (first serious relationship, etc etc), who turned out to be really emotionally abusive and manipulative. He hid EVERYTHING from me, and it really damaged my sense ability to trust people. Additionally, he made incredibly disparaging comments about my appearance, weight, career choice, etc, further fucking over my sense of self worth and self esteem. After we broke up, I realized that a lot of what he did was really fucked up, and worked through most of the issues with therapy and the help of great friends. For the most part, I thought I was fine. Now, a few years later, I'm dating an absolutely wonderful guy. He and I click on so many levels, and it's really a fantastic relationship. It's my first real relationship since breaking up with my ex, and I realized that there are still some emotional scars that are left. Even though my current boyfriend is very open and honest, I still feel like I can't trust him. It's not about infidelity (despite being cheated on in the past, I have no worries about him doing the same). Its about other things, like I feel I can't trust him when he says he wants to hang out with me, that he's missed me, or that he finds me attractive, etc. I assume that he's lying about it, for whatever the reason. He always shows and says that he's glad to be dating me, but I always find myself questioning his motives. (I haven't said anything to him about it, thank goodness) I was just wondering if any fellow Redditors have experienced this, and how they've handled it? I feel silly putting it into words, because logically if he's dating me, he would want to see me (and he's said or done nothing to show me otherwise), but I can't seem to get over that mental block, and I don't want to push him away with my own insecurities.Summary:
Summarize: I find it demeaning and patronising, as a man, that society thinks that I need to be reminded what rape is, and not to do it. Well, I find it demeaning and patronising, as a woman, that society thinks that I need to be reminded what rape is, and not to be raped. This is satire and that's exactly what you missed, maybe because you've never been handed a "how not to be raped" list at a college orientation or in an email forward, or in a women's bathroom stall that it is an almost exact copy of? You've never had the experience of being told how to behave to avoid someone sticking their penis in you without your permission so when the exact same "advice" is flipped to put the responsibility back in the hands of the rapist you get all offended. Too bad. Yes, we need to educate people how to protect themselves, but often the message that this "advice" sends is that you can prevent being raped, so if you are raped it's your fault for failing to be vigilant enough. This image is saying "No, it's always the rapist's fault, let's focus our efforts on blaming rapists and not victims."Summary:
Summarize: My boyfriend and I are 20, and we've been dating for 11 months. I don't know what to do. I hate concerts. To not only have a hard case of ADD and social anxiety stemming from my incredibly terrible case of depression, i hate going. I like music, but I'm small. People step on me, people hit me, push me, and i cant even see anything. So a typical concert consists of me getting hit in the face, stepped on, and staring at the back of someone's shirt. I don't understand how people enjoy themselves and are dancing, and i don't. It seems weird and unnatural. And i feel depressed because everyone has a good time and i cant. My boyfriend loves concerts. The first one, i got sick. Despite me always telling him to stay, he makes me leave and he gets all sad and cries afterwards. The second time, he made me try ecstasy, and i freaked out, and again.... We left. I told him I'd be okay and for us to stay and that i just needed to sit for a bit because the crowd was scaring me, but he made me leave. Again, he cried. The third concert, i got sick, but we stayed. Mainly because i didn't tell him i was sick afterwards and left to take care of my sickness when i went to the bathroom and held the dying pain the entire time. Friday night, i got elbowed in the eye. The main guy came on, and it caused me to cry (from pain) and have a panic attack. I tried to hide it and just stay there till it passed. My boyfriend turned me around to ask if i could see; and saw me tearing up. (I cant hide my emotions. It's too difficult. ) and then he's put in a bad mood, and keeps trying to get me to leave so we can go home, while i stay put and say no. I try to dance with him, while trying to calm down, and he got so angry he starts yelling, and finally we go home. I didn't want to leave because again i fuck up. We went home and he cried because he really wanted to see the guy. Every concert we go to, he always really wants to see them. I have no interest in concerts. Even if i like that person too, i don't really care. He doesn't want to take someone else or go alone. So i go. When I feel sick, he won't stay. He makes me leave even if I can go home alone by myself so he can enjoy himself. And again i feel like shit. I try to stick it out for him, and i feel like a huge disappointment. He then starts crying and saying i need to calm down and to try to not be so negative all the time. LIKE I HAVE A CHOICE. I WISH I COULD BE HAPPY. And i finally felt alone. I feel truly alone because I thought he understood I can't just turn on my happiness. I got very depressed and suicidal and felt the need to self harm. I normally don't get that bad. Since then he has been very cold towards me but still demanding attention from me. I don't know what to do. He wants me to go to another concert in two weeks....I don't even know if we are still going. He doesn't talk, he doesn't want me to take him out or do anything fun. I am still incredibly depressed. I feel terrible. I feel worthless and a disappointment. I guess since he's at my apartment still, it's not as bad. He has his own apartment but stays at mine all the time. I'm really depressed. He's the only person besides family who knows im depressed and I can't even talk to him. People just think I'm really shy. He just wants me to comfort him, cuddle him, but does nothing for me. I'm sad too. I guess I deserve to feel this way, but I can't help but feel like things are going to end. I hate waiting around because I'd rather be dumped already and get on with the pain instead of being paranoid and waiting for it. I can't talk to him about it because he just gets depressed and cries again. I'm going home after my exams this week to get away and havent told him. And before anyone mentions I need to seek help, I've tried. I was going somewhere on campus, and they put me on 7 or 8 anti depressants that didn't work, and the last one gave me seizures. I ended up in the hospital and broke my nose. I went back and told her what happened, and she said the medication DOESNT cause it. (IT DOES.) and i went back on, only to have a seizure again, and almost bleed to death. (I called the campus nurse and she told me to let me bleed it out, after i told her I was bleeding out cups, and i eventually just called 911 before i passed out) i went a few weeks back when I heard that doctor had left, but since they had already "helped me" they can't take me again. I'm currently trying to find a doctor nearby where it'll take my insurance and is close by.Summary:
Summarize: This one happened to me last year over the summer. My girlfriend and I had broken up a few months ago, and I really needed to find another girl to help me get over the dream sex that we had. I knew this girl.. We shall call her Girl with big boobs. Now girl with big boobs had a reputation of getting around. But I had never heard any horror stories and just made the assumption that it'd be god sex. So she comes over, we smoke a little and then head inside to go watch some Netflix in my room. She puts on Brooklyn 99 and asks me if I liked that show. Yeah sure I guess. (I actually love the show I just wanted to signal that I wanted to do something other than watch fucking Netflix.) We're laying on my bed, head to toe and my hand oh her thigh with her ass pointed straight at my face. Oh god please let me have sex with girl with big boobs. Ten minutes into the episode, she turns around and says "can you do me a favor and finger me?" I was happier than a pig in shit. But I replied with "You'll like the sex a lot more than that." she giggled bit her lip and said "only if you're good" So I did what any man would do. I fingered her to the point where she was just about to orgasm and then I'd slow down or stop like my hand was hurting or some shit. As she's about to most orgasm for the like 3rd time she rolls on her back, grabs my hair and pushes my face into her vagina. ALL-FUCKIN-RIGHT BOYS WE GOT A WILD ONE! I wanted her to suck my dick, so i said to her "69" and she spun around and started sucking me off. Now I didn't think I was that good at eating girls out. But after about five minutes of me going to town she sits up in her full mount, pushes her waist down and into my face and let's out a huge moan. I almost thought something was wrong. Well there was, but not for her. My mouth FILLED with this warm weird tasting LIQUID in half a second. I panicked threw her off of me and sat up spitting the unfamiliar substance onto some clothes on the floor. Giving her a puzzled look she blushes giggles and then said "I didn't want to say anything because I thought you might think it's weird" What. The. Fuck.Summary:
Summarize: So, askreddit asked me what advice I had for the younger crowd and this was my contribution. I was too late to the party and nobody will see it, so I'm shamelessly copying it here. Not only does venting feel that much better when someone actually reads it, but I WISH I read a post like this two years ago. So here it goes; I'm not really old, but I'm sad to say that when it comes to buying a house I've grown old out of a bad experience. So, I'll give you; "How to buy a house" . Option 1 : You're buying a new house with all the warranty that comes with it. Well, it's going to cost you, but it's great. Good choice. Make sure the company is a serious one because if it goes belly up during your warranty period you might get fucked. There's not much else that can go wrong here. Spend the extra dollars of having a professional go through the house before the warranty expires just to be sure. No problem Option 2: You're buying a really old house, it looks like shit, and your getting it dirt cheep. Hey, you got a big job ahead, or money set aside to pay someone to fix it up. Either way, that's not a problem because you know this place is a shithole and that's what you're paying for. Option 3: You're buying a old house, but it's partly or completely renovated. Who cares if it's old right? It looks so great, and even though your paying a lot for that newly renovated standard it's still a tad cheaper than a new place right? Great deal right? NO, WRONG . Now is the time to be fucking careful my friend. Anyone can pick up dog shit, wrap it in foil and put a nice little ribbon on it. Looks like fine Belgian chocolate now does it not? Well, it's fucking dog shit. Anyone can paint old rotten wood, and it will look great for about six months. Then you can enjoy the sweet taste of dog shit as it seeps through the tin foil and between your stupid teeth. Anyone can put down some fine ass tiles on a old bathroom, but you won't know if it's really well done until a year later when the bedroom downstairs is either dry or wet as fuck with Winnie the poo and all kinds of shit living in a moldy forest between your floors. But Warcraft MD are you saying I should just stick with option 1 or 2? That really limits available houses. Yeah, it does. But a moldy fuck forest behind your bedroom walls will really limit your lungs, and your wallet if you ever wish to try and resell the godforsaken peace of shit house, that is. So if you HAVE to go with option 3, here's what you do: You can't see the important parts of the house, so be really up tight about the parts you can see. Is there a piece of missing paint at the bottom of the wall by the corner? Who cares right? You can pick up a paint brush and fix that shit up in no time. Probably just some old damage from a kid or a dog or something right? Does not matter, right? FUCKING WRONG . It means the people who live here do not care about details, if they could not pick up a paint brush before selling their newly renovated house they sure as hell did not do a proper job on all the other shit they did either. Is one fucking tile slightly miss-aligned? Don't buy that fucking house or that tile will forever stare you down while your sitting on your throne trying to force out a shit into your shitty house with shitty pipes knowing that you will forever be in a shitty place economically because of he shitty decision you made when you bought a shitty ass house with a shitty ass tile that tried to warn you about how shitty your life could become.Summary:

Summarize: Hey, guys Sorry for all the information I'm about to give you. I just really want some help from people who know all the facts. I am 21f and my boyfriend is 22m. We go to the same college, and have been dating for over a year, and we live together. When we first started dating, we had sex a lot. It seems like everyday that we hung out ended in sex. It was awesome. Things started to slow down a little bit a few months ago. When we started living together... He is a Christian dude, except not very extreme. He turned to religion when his mom passed away last year. He was "saved" at a church camp he chaperoned over last summer, and is truly believing and passionate about God. He used to sometimes cry and say he wished I would just be "saved." I've told him that I feel silly about it and that I'm just not ready for it. So he has put it behind. I go to church with him and never try to disrespect what he believes and we are both okay with that. Except when it comes to sex. I am on birth control. It has been 2 years since I had an implanon put in. I never get a period. At first my sex drive was extremely decreased. I went a year without sex and was completely okay. But now my sex drive is through the roof. I constantly think about sex and am always horny and ready to go! Me and my boyfriend have great sex and I love it. The only problem is now that he won't have sex with me. The first month we lived together, our sex was normal as ever. It was everyday and sometimes twice a day. Now it is once every two weeks if I am lucky. Every time I try to prompt sex with him, he says that we do it too much and he is "straying from the lord." He will keep saying this until he reaches the brink of his horniness I guess. Then he'll have me give him a super quick blow job, but no sex usually. And that makes me all the more horny. But he never messes around with me or anything. I feel like he looks down on me for being so weak/horny. I have to beg and beg for him to have sex with me, but he will never give in until he wants it. And I can't deny him when he wants it, because I already want it so bad. He says all I care about in our relationship is sex, but it's not true. It just builds up inside and it's all I can think about. I feel like a horny man or something. Like other girls aren't like this. He says the devil is tempting me and I need to speak with God. I don't agree. He will have a HUGE boner that I can feel whenever I'm trying to seduce him, but he will still say no to me! I don't get it. Why is it so hard for him to do? :/ I also find that I masturbate way too much. It can be from at least 3 to 10 times a day. :( It doesn't even calm down my sex drive. At all. I just keep going and going. After sex though, I feel relieved and 'finished.' I can achieve an orgasm through masturbation, but I never feel finished, and can go right back to masturbating a minute later. I'm so embarrassed about it, and he doesn't even know I do it. He doesn't masturbate, (unless he somehow does it at work) because I am with him all the time at home. We shower together, sleep in the same bed, and everything. He will have a boner in the shower and won't let me anywhere near it. I just don't get it at all. Am I pushing him? I feel like if genders were reversed here, it would be really bad. I just don't know how to calm myself down. What should I do??? Other than our sex life, our relationship is amazing. He is everything I ever wanted, and I love him with all my heart. He makes me soooo happy, and I definitely do not want to end things with him over this. He doesn't want to get married until he has finished college and has a steady job. He wants to have a huge church wedding or something and be financially stable. That could be 4+ years before anything like that happens. I've suggested no sex at all until then if it makes him uncomfortable and he said "WHAT! No? I just mean we need to slow down. Not stop." But he doesn't realize that I'm not getting anything. So if this all has to be slow "until marriage" is it going to get worse? How should I talk to him? It's very embarrassing to me, because I'm very shy, especially about sex. So I don't know how to approach this. Especially when he gets all Christian on me. Side note - If it is my birth control that has driven me to being a nymphomaniac, it won't be another year until it is removed. But I'm not sure if it is the cause or not. If so does anyone know a way to counter it or decrease my sex drive?Summary:

Summarize: I recently came back from a 2 week business trip and just yesterday I found an opened condom wrapper (it was empty) under our bed while my wife was in the shower. I panicked and took it but didn't tell my wife about the it, I was nervous and now I am paranoid that she might be cheating on me. This felt really coincidental because I had recently came back from a business trip so finding it made me very suspicious. Also when my wife and I use condoms we never use this brand, I don't know what I should do now. Should I confront her? I desperately hope that it is just a misunderstanding...Summary:
Summarize: I went on a cruise. I smuggled a handle on. got shit faced. went on a bar crawl , tried to steal beer from the bar. asked some 15 year old to dance, thank god she said no. shot one of those hocky puck things way to hard and the officer on duty came out to help me find it. I was too hung over to leave room for last two days of trip.Summary:
Summarize: I understand that almost everybody faces persecution at some point in their life, but I was specifically referring to the fact that I have been told multiple times that I am "stupid" or an "idiot" for believing in God. My intelligence and my faith are two different things. I don't blindly believe in God; it's a personal choice that I have weighed in my mind a lot. As for homosexuality, it's unfortunately true that religious groups sometimes feel the need to condemn it. I, however, do not have a problem with it.Summary:
Summarize: I've been dipping for a few years now and i have tried snuff a few times, always copenhagen though. If you have had any natural flavors, it tastes the same except a bit stronger. If you're going to try it i advise that you know how to pack cans really well. The buzz is good and noticeable and last for about 30 minutes or so. But after it all done and you want to get rid of it, it's a bitch. I recommend having water or something else nearby to rinse your mouth out afterwards.Summary:
Summarize: I really hate this sort of approach. Don't get me wrong, I have severe problems with these pesky "MRA's" and generally view them as a proxy used by right wingers as a way to pull people into right wing ideologies that would abuse women based on 2 or 3 valid complaints (more on that later) To be blunt, You are a reactionary, "A reactionary is a person who holds political viewpoints that favor a return to a previous state" ( Statelessness was in fact a previous state of humanity, and you favor a return to it. Unless you think it refers to a political state in which case the "state" that abused women never left, only changed(slightly) I hate HATE these stupid shitty buzzwords that people use. Partriachy, Reactionary, White Privledge These words they mean NOTHING, but they sound stupid White privledge elicits images of every white person sitting around a tea table with monocles, when in fact You mean the Disadvantages faced by people who are perceived "minorities" IE low employment figures and lower wages, this also affects women Regardless of race. Reactionary , Guy's people react to things, Women where treated like shit for huge amounts of time, They REACTED GASP! and started a hugely successful rights movement. Any anarchist in Any area that was previously controlled by anarchist forces is a REACTIONARY because they're trying to re-establish previous political gains. " but wait! it has right wing connotations, " only in 20th century Europe, you fail to realise that generally people don't know WTF you're talking about because Only avid anarchists and marxists Know of the right wing history of the word, Thy usage of Frivolous outdated Words Misleads normal people for no good reason Patriachy I haven't been able to find the actual definition of this one. as far as i can tell Some femenists made it up, and nobody realised that most people have no idea what you're talking about So when ever a feminists uses the word I'm stuck there wondering if i agree with you or not. I can tell you that these MRA's don't get peoples attention by saying "rape is exciting, bitches love it" they lure people in by pointing at / declaring Murderous rants that generalize all men as evil rapists who should die[^1]( Implying that sposual abuse isnt taken seriously when men are the victims ^2 the rape of men is underreported and more servere than you expect(possibly true,Summary:
Summarize: Trying to keep this as brief as possible while still giving enough detail. Our relationship hasn't been good for about 2.5 years. It hasn't been awful, just not great. He suffered a 6 month or so period of depression in which he drank a lot, didn't work, and cried. I paid for everything, worked and went to school full time. It was a lot to hold together for myself, him, us. We decided to move to a different state where he had a job opportunity. He moved 4 month before I did. And even after I moved up, we only saw each other for a day or two every 2-4 weeks. I got lonely asked permission to find a body to fill the void. That only lasted a couple months as the other party developed feelings. An unfortunate series of events end with the BF not having work and sliding into another depression. He ends up getting shitfaced and pees on our bedroom floor. On top of all this, he never holds my hand, buys me flowers, gets me cards/presents for any holidays or even my birthday, etc. He isn't very physically affectionate in general unless he has been drinking. So I break up with him. I love him, but can no longer figure out how to be in a romantic relationship with him. He is devastated. I move out. We stupidly think we can be friends and continue to hang out, each of us is already seeing someone else. Fast forward 2 months. I stop seeing the new person as I realized it's never going to be something serious. I start to miss the good things about my old relationship. Hanging out with the ex, we've been drinking, he kisses me, and it feels like it used to when we first got together. We talk about "dating" and going on adventures instead of hoping right back into our old relationship. We say we'll talk about the things we want to fix, that we need the other person to work on, what we need to work on for our own selves. But now it's 5 months later and nothing has changed. We only went on one "date." We rarely talk about what didn't work before. I find myself being annoyed, frustrated, saddened by all the things that remain the same. He still doesn't have any sort of financial stability and is drinking a lot with his guy friends. I told him I think we really need to break up for a while (but I really mean for good). Nothing's changed. He agrees, but is heartbroken. He texts me a couple days later that he wants to make me dinner and talk. He wants to work on things and fix this, make it work. I seriously don't think it can be fixed. He hasn't worked on anything. I've been trying to work on taking better care of myself. I don't know how to leave. I love him. I hate seeing how much this hurts him. And I feel like I'll be taking everything away from him. He tells me how much he misses me and our girls (the cats). I feel like I'm taking his family from him (he's not American and doesn't have any family in the US). I feel like I've tried talking to him about the problems in our relationship. I've aired my frustrations. And nothing. How do I leave?Summary:
Summarize: I've pretty much been a CA for 2 years. Met a guy last July, fell in love with him pretty quickly, we spent New Year's in NYC blah blah blah. Shortly after or around that time, we started to drift apart. In March, he says that I'm a "best friend to him right now" and essentially, that I have to figure my own shit out before we can have a relationship (he's also an alcoholic with his own deep shit going on). I go into the psych hospital because of alcohol induced panic attacks (though that's hardly the only cause). He visits me while I'm there. I told him how they have me on a detox and I feel "calmer and healthier than ever." I'm sober one day going out of the hospital. I've tried texting him twice since he has claimed to be a support for me. Then, an angry facebook message as he didn't respond. I miss him. I drank for a whole month, then had two days sober, and I'm now drinking heavily tonight. Is it all gone? Do you ever feel you can control it?Summary:
Summarize: Aerys was a crazy fuck that burnt people alive just out of completely imagined paranoia and was fully ready to destroy the largest city in the continent believing he would be reborn as a dragon amidst it all and was in general such a mad man that he managed to incite a revelion that took down a dinasty that lasted almost 300 years. Now, it can certainly be argued that Dany's choice in doing this was unwise but I really don't see anything "mad" about it. 1) She's very angry on a very personal level because Barristan was a loyal friend and advisor. People can often do nasty things when they're in that mindset without necesarily being crazy. 2) All of them, even if not directly related to this incident, are in fact slave masters; cruel as hell and each and every single one of them surely wants to see her dead. They are not their friends, they are not innocent people in general terms and it's logical to assume that at least some of them are involved with the Sons of The Harpy.Summary:

Summarize: One more cop story about my uncle who is a cop in Littleton (he has so many good ones). This wasn't actually an arrest since the guy was dead. Anyways, they get a call about a weird smell coming from a guys apartment, like decomposing flesh. So they get in there and find this guy butt naked dead in his bedroom. He is laying on his back with a giant dildo coming out the side. So they place bets on whether it is in our out when they flip him over. It was in, come to find it, there was another foot long dildo up there. So this guy rammed a foot long dildo up his colon, and another one about half way up and then died basically. They also found an ironing board upside down, picture the X shape the legs make. On one side of the X leg was a dildo attached, so this guy would ride the iron so the one leg would shove the dildo up his ass. One more fun fact, they found zero porn in this guys place, just a picture of a deer tapped to the wall by the ironing board.Summary:
Summarize: You are getting advice on not going into a masters discipline without test driving it first - and I agree 100%. However, be careful not to get too comfortable before going back to school. I got a joint MBA and MS in CS about 8 years after undergrad (I got an arts degree). Since graduating undergrad, I had worked solely in software fields, and had begun an ascent into middle management. 29 year old me found grad school a colossal waste of time. I needed to get the degrees to further my career, but I was beyond what they were teaching in class in what I was doing on a daily basis. I dropped $80k to get 5 letters on my resume, and don't think I learned a thing that was applicable to my career.Summary:
Summarize: So, my brother and I used to play a LOT of Halo (before we knew about the internet) when I was but a wee lad. He always got the "cool" name (at the time, we both thought that AceOfSpades was better than the one I chose, GeneralFartsalot). Anyways, a few years ago when he went to college, I made an Xbox Live account. Being the unimaginative little $&¡+ I was, I tried his old Halo name. Apparently Aceofspades was used (Honestly, I had no idea it was an actual game), so I added the 159 and removed the s. Ever since then it's been my go-to username.Summary:

Summarize: Backstory: 4 years ago we [Mary and I]used to work together, but never really talked or hung out. After I left, and a couple of months later, she 'popped' up on my feed and wanted to hang out. We went out, mostly as friends in my head, and didn't i didn't pursue it as such. She's reeeeally good looking. Very attractive. To the point where other girls hate her/don't get along/doesn't have many girl friends. She was in an industry that validated physical appearance. She's a 9, I'm a 5, but knowing the crazy/hot matrix, and where we worked was the 'good looking place' I knew well enough that looks aren't everything. Being outside 'the bubble' I could see that everyone wanted to give/get attention to/from her, which was the reason why she had to hit me over the head caveman style to tell me 'Hey dummy, I like YOU!". I'm happy enough to be friends with someone hot, but I wasn't going to 'compete' with everyone else for her attention. I already know that I'm worth more than that. Somewhere along the way, she developed an attraction for me, and she was a really nice person one on one when separated from all the BS, and I enjoyed time with her and we decided to make it more official as BF/GF. A little after we decided to make it a bit more official, she flew back home, and while home, she told me that she was at a party with her ex-FWB [Jim] and everyone was drunk, so she 'had to' sleep over in his bed. Jim was a bit handsy and he had a premature accident that didn't lead to much. She was disgusted and she told me and wanted to continue with me in a real relationship. She said that she knew that it was a bad choice, but once he 'came' she realized that I was more important and wanted to come clean, and that the whole situation was ok since her and I weren't 'official, official' yet. Yes I know I was stupid and trusting. Obviously something more happened. The beginning of the relationship was great. A really good caring relationship for 6 months, then it slowly devolved. It's not 100% her fault. I'm a pretty simple quiet person. I don't need a lot of outward validation from other people. She did. So what I thought was a fantastic relationship, she was very happy too, but she felt that she needed 'all the trimmings' which includes daily things such as 'I love/miss you texts' which I, as an introvert, don't understand. I'm a firm believer of absence/heart/fonder, and daily texts/facebook posts to me seem like a pathetic salve to deal with separation anxiety. (part of the reason why I'm fine that we're not together anymore.) We were both born to families that weren't very nurturing, and I realize that can create issues. For me it used to be attention seeking/validation, but now I'm perfectly fine being alone or with good company. For her she needed some sort of outward validation. And somewhere around the 6 month mark she gave me an ultimatium that I had to be the first one to say 'those three words' first, because she was tired of being the one to say it first in previous relationships. Then everything slowly devolved while I did nothing to address very important issues. In retrospect, at or around the 6 month time, these were issues that I've given thought to that created conflicts in our relationship that I wasn't 'man enough' to address. Her ex-fiancee [Bob]. She had broken up with him and went no contact waaay before we got together. Around the 6 month mark she told me that he had reconnected with her, but she was keeping proper boundaries with him. Caught her with a 'I love you' text from him and now realize that she gaslighted me with "That's what good friends say to each other" Her ex-high school crush[Cal] . He broke up with his long time girlfriend. Cal emailed Mary as a 'high what's up' email and she told me. She gaslighted me and told me that he was a dummy. But as idiot people do when they break up, he played the 'I wonder what would have happened if you and I gave it a shot now/back then.' email game with Mary. Mary flew back to see if 'there was anything there'. There wasn't. She flew back, felt guilty and told me how stupid she was for fantasizing about something so stupid. Her re-devotion to organized religion and adoration of her pastor. Church provided that 'family' that I couldn't and validation that she craved for provided by her pastor, of whom, had never met me but gave our relationship no hope (correct), because I didn't go to church (incorrect), and also provided her future husband. (More on that later). So after the first six months, the relationship just devolved. The end came when I picked her up at the airport when she came back from a visit to her family. It was a dead drive for some food, and a drop off at her place. We sat, and talked. It was the break up talk. I don't remember much, but I do remember when she said her ex-fiancee re-proposed to her and she said that she "couldn't" because she was in love with someone else, of which I though "Who?". So we broke up, and she asked me to sleep over, of which I said, 'This is it. It's over. Goodbye." And I meant it. I didn't want to speak to her again for a long, long time, if ever at all. So for the next three months, she emailed and called a couple of times, but I never responded, or looked her up on facebook. All the smart things, but at the end of three months I got a whole bunch of emails/messages, and I got curious, and I went to her facebook page (don't have one myself) and it said that she was engaged. I was upset, but couldn't understand why. We had a couple of loose ends to tie up so we had to meet, and since she was getting married, it had to be done right away. Can you guess what happened? Yep, she was marrying some guy in her church that was "Whiteknighting" her the whole time. He would ask her out to salsa dances even while we were together. I thought it was weird and she agreed, but when she announced she was getting married, I knew it was him, and she knew I would have been smart enough to figure it out anyways. He put the moves on her weeks after we broke up, and somewhere within the past three months he proposed and she accepted and were going to get MARRIED three months after when we met again. She said that it's been a whirlwind, and she's really confused and tired, and I'm the only person she feels comfortable talking to because she feels really lonely. She wants me to be at the wedding. I refuse to go because when it comes to the forever/hold/peace part, I told her that the pastor would have to agree with me that it's waaay to soon, and just even inviting me shows poor intuition. She said that she though of that. After all this time, I'm still amazed that her pastor would agree to marry the two so quickly right after he 'broke us up', but again, this is what men will do for attention to/from her. In anycase, at that meeting, I told her under no uncertain terms, that I never wanted to speak to her ever again, that I gave her my blessing for her marriage, that she's allowed to move forward and pursue her happiness, and that I refused to stand in that way, [Like 99% of all the men in her life who are dirtbag ex's, whiteknights, and father figures] She a freakout about the fact that we'd never see each other again and that our relationship in all forms was over, but I demanded that it was all for the best for both of us to go no contact and it's better to start right then and there. And I did. After we left, I never contacted or cyberstalked her ever. Although I did think about what happened very, very often, and I realized that I had a hand in the devolution of the relationship, and that I needed to do a lot of growing up before I went into another relationship. I needed to stop being that 'people pleaser' and that 'nice guy' that I thought that everyone was supposed to be. It was exhausting for me, and also probably for her. It took a long time for me (with my poor family background) that I should stop 'being nice' and focus more on being my authentic self, and to be kind and honest, and more decisive, and to set boundaries that I'm willing to enforce and not compromise. I'm better, but it's a lifelong process. It wasn't a bad relationship. I needed it. I'm learning from it and still discover new insights. Two Months Ago I wake up to a knock on my door. It's her, and I haven't seen or spoke or cyberstalked anything of her (for my own sanity) for three years. I'm dumbfounded and all I can do is listen as she apologetically retells me the last three years of her life. She says I was right about everything (although I don't remember ever bringing it up). She got married soon after last we met, and soon after she got married the church boy turned out be exactly that. A church boy that whiteknighted her, and with the blessing of the pastor, preyed on her religious beliefs to make her believe that the marriage was supposed to be ordained by God himself, that she thought of me every day, and she wanted to talk to me too, but she knew that I would have refused to talk to her while she was married. (Correct) She said that the divorce was finalized and as soon as that was done, she wanted to reconnect with me. I was dumbfounded. I couldn't say much, except for that I wasn't angry or hated her for what happened, that I was mostly angry for not doing the right things to respect myself and her. I closed the door and she left. After talking to a bunch of people, they told me that divorce is a pretty humiliating event, and that if I was still confused, that I could at the very least still listen, and that I had put a considerable amount of work in self realization that could probably help the both of us. So I sent an email that simply said "I'm still confused, but if you need me to, I will just listen." Sent it. And. Nothing. Nothing the day after, the week after. After a month, a sense of relief came. She came, she saw, after 3 years decided that it was a bad idea. Great. I put it completely out of my mind. Wrong. Two weeks ago, I get an email from her. She asks to meet the next day. We meet in a coffee shop, and she just starts talking. About nothing, as if nothing has ever happened and we are all completely fine and it's a just a bunch of 'girls getting together to chat'. I'm uncomfortable, but I say a couple of things, mostly apologizing about certain things about me in the relationship. She talks about work, maybe one or two things about her terrible marriage, but mostly on things about work. Nothing of substance really gets talked about for 15 minutes. She says she has to go get something to eat, and asks me to join her. Reluctantly I agree, and it's another 45 minutes of 'girl talk' which is her mostly talking. After she's done talking we leave. She tries to give me a warm hug, and we separate and leave. I thought about it for a day or two. And I got angry because this time I was really confused. She said that she wanted to talk to me every day for 3 years, gets divorced, shows up at my door unannounced. I send an email that I can talk/listen to her and it gets ignored for a month by her. I'm not proud of it, but for the first time in 3 years I looked at her facebook profile. If it was set to public for my sake, I don't know. But in that one month window, she went on a vacation to east asia with some guy. Another whiteknight? I really don't know, but the parallels to our other relationship make my gut queasy. It makes no sense. She thinks about me everyday for 3 years, yearns to talk to me, but given the choice, she'd rather go on vacation first. Why not go on vacation with the FWB/Whiteknight then reconnect with me instead of forcing me through another cycle? I facebook some more, and it does seem like some sort of solid relationship. She's pretty private overall, so 'love selfies' aren't her thing. I was so angry at being manipulated again and I came to an epiphany. Trust. I just don't trust her. I never did. I don't now. I sent an email saying essentially "I wanted our meeting to validate the past, but I got nothing. I don't trust you, but I wish you all the best." Now for the past two weeks I've gone crazy with facebook stalking, trying to work out the timeline. It makes absolutley no sense. She said she came to me as soon as the divorce was over, but then this new guy/FWB. Her thinking about me constantly, and even stalking me at work. I am so confused. Is this what FWB is? Is what she is doing rude and selfish? What's the point of all of this? Why am I feeling so crazy?Summary:

Summarize: My aunt once complained to her doctor about extreme abdominal pain and had it dismissed as menstrual cramps. Only when the pain did not subside for months did the doctor agree to do a scan, when it was discovered that she had several malignant tumors in her uterus and ovaries. After surgery to remove the uterus and ovaries, she complained about a new severe abdominal pain, which was dismissed as her being a wimp about the pain. Only after she insisted (about a month after surgery) did the doctors agree to check on it, and they found that they had nicked her colon during surgery. Needless to say, the excrement that had leaked from her colon and caused a severe infection in one of her kidneys, her spleen, her appendix, part of her liver, and a pretty large portion of her intestines. All of the infected parts were removed. Basically, if you were to cut open her abdomen today, it's pretty much empty of everything but the bare necessities for survival. All of the surgeries and infections could have been avoided by doctors simply taking the time to address their patient's concerns and not just dismiss them as whining.Summary:
Summarize: So I partially understand when people are kinda stressed in HL and that the occasional Gazlowe and Nova mains are a bit frowned upon. When playing HL, I really try my best to win, including the draft and even if that means I won't get to play the hero I wanted to play. But in UNRANKED there is literally nothing at stake. So can we please use this format to have some relaxed and fun games? Sentences like "oh god 2 spec nice troll pick" don't make any sense in the first place and even less so in unranked. I'd honestly rather try a 5 spec comp than playing Kael/E.T.C./Rehgar yet again - I already saw the latter in HL a few times, I believe. If you are not so confident about the draft, that is your chance to see if and how you can make it work - without the risk of losing anything if it doesn't! :) First pick Nova? In HL, I'd say: Meh. In unranked however, the question should be: What can we do to make that work? So we need wave clear and maybe quite a bit poke so that Nova can roam around and kill people? Which ban will support this slightly suboptimal choice? Use those weird picks to get experience with bad comps, you can capitalize on that later. When you encounter the pesky Nova main in HL later, you might know what to do and might have a shot at winning despite not getting matched with the Korean pro team you deserve to get matched with. And ffs, don't ban the pre pick of your own team just because you don't agree with them. That just does not achieve anything. If you see me pre picking a Hero you are not too sure about, you are right: In unranked, I test heroes I am not confident with. I have a brief list of heroes I want to play, but won't do so in HL because I'm not good with them yet. So I go to unranked and pick the best of my 'bad' heroes to improve. Ban that one and you get another one that's even worse. Yes, you can stop me from playing Abathur (because he is totally not good on Cursed Hollow), but you can't force me to play Kael/E.T.C./Rehgar. Here, have a level 1 Chromie instead.Summary:

When you actually look at what boots are they are separate items which give different stats.

Summarize: I need help and I am not sure on who to talk to about it, so I just thought why not anonymously post. I hate that I have this feeling because I feel like know I'm overanalyzing it, but I still feel as though I am still in the right to be bothered and could really use advice, please be easy on me. So I recently discovered that my boyfriend commented on this girl's profile picture saying how cute she is and he's never commented on my pics ever saying that genuinely. He has complimented me once, but I enticed him to, I remember I told him how rude he was for commenting something on one of my photos and right after he complimented me just to try to make up for it so I felt that it wasn't really genuine at all. (This is going to sound even more childish, I apologize in advance) Even when we game together I noticed that he complains about so any mistakes that I make and it no longer becomes just advice anymore. I can understand if you were just telling me something, but there is a huge difference when he says it in a certain tone. Then when he plays with other people he is always pointing out how well they are doing to help him and how they're doing this exact thing that I didn't do the previous games and it just irritates me because I feel that he is giving me these subtle hints or something.Summary:

Summarize: so yesterday i had made plans to go see my girlfriend who lives 2 hours away and that i had been dating for 8months. our relationship has been going really well up until now. Friday arvo i asked her if she still wanted me to come to see her at her home 2 hours away in which she replied "yeah if you want to but if you cant im not bothered x" followed by " actually No, i dont want you to watch me play cos il play bad" so i said ok dont worry about it i wont come then. this made me feel as that she didnt want me to come when i havent seen her in a week and a half. later that night she messaged me saying that i should of come and asking if i could come now. not having anything to do that night i made plans with my sister and told her that i couldn't come. she then instantly got pissed of at me and got really angry with me. she then got taling about how we are different and then sent these messages: her - 'i still think what its like to be with other guys! and that doesn't mean i dont love you but its still there. all the time in the back of my head. and i still fell the same way as i did about (another guy) at the start of our relationship! i always think about it!" then i asked "you feel the same way about me as (another guy)? which she replied with "i dont know what i want! i dont want to loose you but i want to do other things!" then i said " well you cant have both, what do you mean by other things" then she said "Well i just want to see what its like being with some one elset to feel what its like to be single and do what i want. i dont want to loose you tho" then i said "no but right now your saying you want to break up and how am i ment to feel when i dont want to!" which se replied with "i dont want to break up i just, idunno... i still want to be with you but i want to be able to see what its like" this has been stuck in my head for days and i cant help thinking about her with another guy. did she say this because we where fighting and she was losing the argument or does she really mean it?? over the last day and a bit she hasn't been acting her self while she is messaging me eg not replying or replying very bluntly but it has got better today. is it just because shes still pissed or is she sick of this relationship where as a week ago the thought of cheating on me to her made her cry. sorry if this doesn't make much sense but i had to ask theres so many thoughts going through my head about my girlfriend who im in love with please help reddit!!Summary:
Summarize: I haven't talked about this since it happened and probably never will, aside from sharing it here with reddit. My friends who were with me just kind of never talked about it because it was so weird. It was around 2am and I was with 12 other ladies and we were all hammered in a hotel bar for a bachelorette party. We saw these 3 guys, probably aged 19-22 and invited them back to one of our rooms. On the stairs up we were joking around that we were glad we didn't spend money on strippers. These guys, while pretty young, were very cute. They had barely entered the room before we tore their clothes off, blindfolded two of them and tied them to a chair. Their friend was crying about feeling sick so we just left him alone. All I can remember is me and some of the ladies taking turns laughing and riding the two guys who were tied up. A few of the ladies took turns blowing them. I couldn't believe what was happening but it was really fun at the time. When that was over I realized that I kind of recognized one of the guys. I was recently divorced and one of the guys looked just like my ex-husband's nephew. I couldn't tell for sure because right about the time I was really looking at him he got all awkward and left in a hurry. I still am not sure to this day whether it was my nephew or not.Summary:
Summarize: I've been living with my roommate (who I've known since I was 11) since last October and over the past 10 or so months she has become sluttier and sluttier. She has slept with over 25 men since I moved in and her number is only rising. Since the spring she has not only been sleeping with lots of men but she sleeps with them all over the apartment- like on the kitchen counter (ew). I've asked her to stop and she shrugs the whole thing off like it's no big deal. Luckily although her sluttiness has been getting out of control I have a wonderful boyfriend and we are about to move in together. I told her the last week of July that we had found a place and I would be moving out in September. She said that was fine as she has another friend to move in with her. I spoke with that friend and we made a tentative agreement to do the moving switch the middle of the month. I now have a surgery scheduled earlier in september so I told this friend I'd be out by the first. After a few texts back and forth over the course of a few days it seemed assumed that we would split September's rent. Tonight as my boyfriend and I came home to my apartment I opened the door to see my roommate giving head to a man I've never seen before on the couch. The door was not locked. They were both butt naked. The whole apartment STUNK of weed. (I am not a smoker and neither was she before this slut faze began... I'm cool with smoking but I do believe that if you're going to do it at home both housemates should agree it's ok). The boyfriend and I instantly started to get headaches from the smell so I quickly grabbed as much stuff as I could and we left to go back to his place for the night. I am feeling that I cannot live with her any longer. Her blatant disregard for what I've asked has gone too far and I'm not comfortable staying there anymore. Rent for August is paid and as of Wednesday Cable/Electricity will be paid as well. We have not signed a lease on this apartment and as far as I know my name is not on the month to month lease, the cable, electricity or any other bill. My question is this: besides my conscious taking a hit and technically being a big doucher, is there anything stopping me from refusing to pay the rent I had verbally agreed to pay for September? Initially I had planned on paying (the split rent with the new girl) but because now I feel like I can't live there I no longer feel like it should be my responsibility. I hope hoping for some advice on what the next course of action should be.Summary:

This is very likely because in On The Run Amethyst completely lost herself into fighting pearl because she was so outraged by the fact that she was a Kindergarten gem. Most likely the other Kindergarten gems (peridot,jasper[uncomfirmed,theory]) will brainwash Amethyst and Steven is the only hope to get Amethyst back in the Crystal Gems or atleast stop hurting Earth.Summary:
Summarize: My boyfriend and I have been together a good minute now, met last August, instantly clicked. He's amazing and I want things to work out between us and they do! We get along amazingly. I adore every thing about him. Our sex life has become an issue for us both. He has an extremely small penis. NOT THE PROBLEM! I don't even care. Normally, sex is important to me but I am so turned on by everything about who he is that, for once, I can honestly say sex isn't even relevant. Good, bad, or ugly, I still want him. However, it has become more than obvious that he has visible insecurities with his size. His insecurities make me uncomfortable, not his penis. The longer we are together, the more he makes it into an impending issue. I DON'T CARE! I just want intimacy with him but he is so insecure about himself that we can't enjoy each other. I was shocked the first time we had sex, I'll admit, but was relieved and comforted by how okay he was. That put me at ease and we had awesome sex several time.... merely, several. Since god damned August. I googled and read about positions for smaller men, sought advice through the internet from women with similar experience... the whole nine. I never wanted what was noticeably an obstacle to become one. I love him and I want him, completely. As time passes, he is less and less affectionate and extremely rarely willing to be intimate with me. I can't even figure out how to initiate any sort of sexual behavior with him, anymore. It's as if we are only friends. I don't want to be friends. I want him to be comfortable and just be with me. I know he desires me; I feel like I am banging my head against the wall here. He has recently started making self-degrading statements about himself when I try to initiate sex or even messing around together. He'll hardly even make out with me. When I feel hurt by that and kind of back off a little, he goes above and beyond to keep me. So what the fuck? I don't want a completely sexless relationship. I can't be happy with that. Penetration isn't a huge deal; there are endless ways two people can find pleasure together. I really care about him and want us to have a nice relationship WITH sexual activity.... I feel like we are just becoming friends and I hate it. What the hell can I do/say to make him comfortable??? f-27 m-31 Please help me reddit.Summary:
Summarize: Over the various harrowing, snowdown and other events I have managed to rack up a nice small collection of summoner icons. I have about 10 non-default icons in total (soon to be 15), and I think its fair to say that I would prefer anyone of them over any of the default icons, the default icons are just so ugly and outdated its a no brainer not to use them, at least in my perspective. Anyway, when I go to change my icons it can look messy and I get confused sometimes, having 39 icons (29 of them being default) it can be a little eyesore with all the various colours, shapes and crudely drawn art sketches of minions, monsters and all the other weird gubbins you find there. And i'm not trying to hate on the icons here, they are a nice gesture and the fact that Riot has supplied us with a generous number of icons to choose from is pretty cool for new users. But I mean, the default icons do not even compare in any way, shape or form to the majority of the earned ones, and when you have the option to choose between default or earned, which ones are you gonna pick? So anyway, what I am suggesting is that in the store, under the summoner icons page, you could have the option to disable or enable the default icons. This would really clear out all the clutter of the summoner icon tab when changing an icon, and I think it would be a great addition for some of the older users who have gathered many cool icons over time. Once again, this is just an idea and a personal preference. I am not completely hating on Riots icons, and I know that many people do in fact prefer to use the default icons.Summary:

Summarize: About two months ago I drove from Flagstaff to Phoenix, with my friends D and N, to go to a rave (Rainbow Brite 2) We have plenty of money (for broke ass people), a new sack of dank buds, an old sack of perfectly cured dank buds (PERFECT!!!) and the next forty-eight hours to party like we mean it. We cruse down the road blasting tunes and rocking out. We smoke bowls (should we pack #1 or #2 dude?) and eat snacks. We bought a bunch of string cheese, snack bars, juice and other awesome munchies. We get to the party and during the securing of the car and stashing our valuables I can't find my wallet. I figure I won't stress it because I still have all my money and I can find my wallet latter. When we get to the security guy we won't let us in because I don't have I.D. to prove I am not 16 (I am 21 and most people think I am quite a it older) and my friend D does not have any I.D. either so we can't get in. We dejectedly walk back to the car feeling really let down. We get back to the car and drive off into the city and start calling everyone we know in Phoenix because we still want to party and have allot of money and weeds. We are smoking and driving and I decide to pull off the road so I won't be driving all erratic while I look up numbers. As we are sitting of the side of the road I see a big white pedo-van pull out of the ally behind us and as it turns I see the rack of sirens. They are obviously going to come investigate us so I decide if I drive away (in a reasonable manner) I have a slightly better chance of them not investigating us. I have a warm pipe with a half smoked bowl sitting in my lap so I put it in my pocket because I know I can't hide it anywhere in my car this quick. After following us for a few blocks they flip on their sirens right before I pull out onto a major street (why do they always pull you over in really shitty spots) and two cops hop out. A female cop comes up to my window and asks for my papers. I tell her I don't have my license but I give her my registration and insurance though. A male cop walks up to the passenger window and says "I smell weed in the car" and pulls N out of the front seat and sits him on the curb and pulls D out of the back seat (my cars a two door) as I am giving the female cop my info he says "Get her out of the car it smells like weed" referring to me. I am a man but I have long hair and he only saw me from behind, it happens sometimes. Despite the fact that I was going to jail I thought that was kind of funny. The female cop then pulls me out of the car and handcuffs me, pats me down, she feels the pipe and ask if she can get stuff out of my pockets I tell her no (can't search me without a warrant bitches) so she sits me on the curb and goes and has a brief conversation with her partner than climbs into their van starts running all our info (remember two of us have no ID on us). The guy cop is grilling my friends and one of them ( I think D) tells the cop that yes we were smoking in the car. As he digs through the car he finds my sneak-a-toke and another one hitter in my friends bag. He now has two counts of paraphernalia against us. He keeps re asking us who we are and why we are there (trying to catch us lying) I will answer some of his questions be I don't say anything self incriminating. I admit nothing but my friends are not so strong willed. After looking through my car as thoroughly as he can with out breaking protocol. "So why are you guys in Phoenix?" "To go to a rave, we couldn't get in." "So you guys have a bunch of ecstasy in the car. Thats what people do at raves right?" "Fuck that shit, some people go for the dancing and music." "Right..." He comes up to me and asks pointblank what we were smoking out of, I know he knows I have a pipe in my pocket so i decide that I might as well give it to him, I really don't like the idea of giving a cop a pipe with weed in it but He knows it is there and already has plenty to arrest me for so I give it to him. A little while latter he comes back over (it felt like forever but it was probably like thirty seconds) and asks was that all the weed you guys have? I don't answer. He goes back to th car and pocks around a bit more then comes back over. "Look I'm going to be strait with you, If you give us the rest of your marijuana we will destroy it and let you guys leave with nothing but a ticket for driving without a license. I am serously conflicted, he is either a decent person who realizes we are just dumb kids and he has better shit to deal with or he is an evil pig and wants me to self incriminate so they can better press charges latter. I figure that at this point I am already in trouble for pipes and the weed in the pipe so I go for it. I still don't know how I decided other than to say it felt like he was legit. I tell him where my nugs are stashed in the car and he goes and grabs them and drops them in his bag of pipes. The female cop then exits the van and walks me over to my car and tells me she is going to remove my handcuffs. I sign the ticket for driving with out ID on you (A jail-able criminal offense in AZ just as a heads up) and lets us drive off into the night, after telling us it would be a good idea if we left phoenix. We drive back up to flagstaff, arrive around 2 a.m. (when they stop selling alcohol round here), on a hunch I decide to call this random Japanese guy who gave me his number and we get invited to a party and a friend of a friend's house. We get there and tell them of our adventures. One kid drives back to his house to get his weed and brings i back just so we could smoke it because the cops took all ours, he didn't even smoke with us. So we ended up getting drunk and high with a bunch of Asians and had a great end to an otherwise not so great day. I really, really hope those cops hot-boxed their van with my weed because both sacks were really good, but the older on was perfect. I would hate for those choice trees to be waisted. Those Asian kids were all super nice, really awesome people. I also got the charges for the license dropped since it was clear that I had lost my wallet hundreds of miles from home.Summary:
Summarize: Slightly Related Story Time: One time in the ninth grade I went to my school dance. I'm not much of a dancer, and I've never been fond of dance music, so I basically hung out with friends the whole time. We decide it's too loud in the cafeteria (where the dance was being held) so we want to walk around the school and continue to talk. Unfortunately, there was a couple sitting on the fucking floor, blocking us from leaving. Some bolder people that wanted to get out stepped over them, which I suggested, but my friends wanted to wait it out because they were a bit socially awkward back then. After fifteen minutes I was getting frustrated. I picked up a glow stick from the floor, walked to secluded spot where the doorway was in view, and whipped it at them. They didn't fucking notice. I found a second glow stick and tried again. Still nothing. My friends and some other people are watching me at this point. I tried a third time and it hit the girl in the ear. She starts screaming and the guy gets up and walks towards me. I was a scrawny kid so I was scared shitless. I couldn't believe that I had such a bad idea. Did I really think that it would work? Anyways, he comes over and screams "DID YOU FUCKING THROW A GLOW STICK AT MY GIRLFRIEND?" I reply, "What are you talking about? I didn't throw anything!" He insists I did. I insist I did not. I ask my friends to vouch for me. They say I didn't do anything. Luckily nobody else that saw me has bothered to speak up. He finally gets frustrated and leaves. Anyways, as time went on I found out that, despite being inconsiderate, he wasn't such a bad guy. At prom I saw him and his girlfriend again and told them that "if they started making out in the doorway I'd find another glow stick to throw at them". They didn't know what I was talking about so I let sleeping beasts lie.Summary:
Summarize: Yep, I do. Maybe not to the extent that OP described, or at least not all the time (though that's assuming OP does this all the time). It goes hand in hand with one of the most important lessons I've learned concerning relationships of any type: most (not all) people don't want to be right, they want to think they're right. I'm not doing them a favor by correcting a incorrect fact or grammar mistake ^ , I'm the asshole that made them feel dumb so I can feel better about myself. While that's not the case, it's likely how they feel about the situation. When I know more about a topic someone's excited to talk to me about (or when I'm familiar with every single topic they ever bring up) the person could feel like I'm trying to one-up them all the time. I'm not the guy who is interested in the same topic as them, I'm the asshole who is always politely telling them "I already knew that." By letting people be wrong and sharing exciting "new" things with me it allows us to get to know each other better. Without those steps it's very likely my good intentions will make me out to be a dick. As people get to know me better these rules of interaction go away slowly.Summary:
Summarize: Fortunately this wasn't a super drawn-out or serious relationship, but I was young and naive and head over heals for this guy I worked with. He was 32, I was 18, he was on the rocks for a while with a long-term girlfriend, and we started hooking up right after they broke up and he moved out. It got more serious and went on for about 6 months, while we never put a label on it he told me he wasn't interested in dating anyone else. One day I get a message from a random friend, asking if I was still dating this dude because her friend had a crush on him. I thought it was weird but responded that I was. She called me and told me that he'd been with this other girl for the same amount of time as me, and she had become his "girlfriend" about 3 months before. So, technically, he was cheating on her with me. Me and girl 2 (we were Facebook friends and had met a few times) talked on the phone and told each other our histories with dude. We had very similar stories. We decided the best way to go about it would be to ambush him. She parked a few blocks away from my apartment and came in while I invited him over to "talk." We were sitting on the couch when he walked in and I will NEVER forget the look on that fucker's face. We spent about an hour yelling it him, telling him he was a piece of shit, and he had the fucking nerve to tell girl 2 that I was a huge mistake and he had realized just the day before that he was in love with her. Ouch. We high-fived, reaffirmed our chicks before dicks philosophy, and I told her to call me if she was having a hard time. She took him back two days later and they're still together.Summary:
Summarize: Sure I got one. Picked up an ipv2s a couple of weeks back. Every time I rebuilt I would shoot for 1.1 as this would allow me to use the full wattage range with maximum surface area. It seemed every time I would be either to low .7-.8 or too high 1.4-1.6 this isn't a huge deal but kind of annoying (yes I was using steam engine). Today I rebuild my magma and hit it bang on 1.1 whhoooo, except I upgraded my mod sometime last week to run 70 watts .. So as you might imagine I can't actually go up to 70. Dual coils at 1.1 is the flavor kingSummary:
Summarize: He's a troll. Look through the full two days of comments he's made and it is crystal clear. Hell, just look at his name. And should he actually be from Texas, which I doubt, then I apologize on behalf of the rest of Texas. It is clear someone moved a rock somewhere and this slithered out. Your average Texan does not hold such ridiculously ignorant views. We are generally a progressive, accepting people. The problem comes from the fact that those progressive, accepting people don't go around shouting their views or trying to force their views on others. We are typically live and let live. But those that hold toxic views feel the need to spread those toxins. They do so in the most obnoxious and disputable ways and that unfortunately leaves the rests of us looking bad, too. Now, do we have assholes? Of course! Texas is 268,500 square miles or 695,621 square kilometers and we border four states. Assholes are bound to happen.Summary:
Summarize: Jax' complete disregard for authority or rules, and the mystery behind him. He had no Judgement or Reflection, suddenly this guy no one has heard of before is just there . Not only is he there, but he makes it clear that he's the best Champion by a long shot, so they put special restrictions on him. As a giant "fuck you" to the man , he mocks their petty handicaps and starts using a lamppost as a weapon. Nothing slows him down, he still stomps, despite the fact that he has no weapon, no history, no faction, no confirmed species even. He has purple skin, only a few fingers and toes, and he probably has a bunch of blue eyes, but there's no way of knowing that for sure due to the hood. A couple of hypothesis stand out to me. His lack of background and his clothing cause some people to think he's the world's most badass minion. It would also explain the lack of Judgement and Reflection, because obviously minions don't go through that process to participate in League matches, right? My favorite theory though is that he is somehow related to Baron Nashor. The visual similarities are apparent, and they are respectively the strongest monster and champion. MY wild idea is that Jax IS Baron Nashor. The monsters in Summoners Rift are just copies of real monsters that are summoned for the matches. Baron in particular isn't necessarily accurate because the only evidence that the League had of the creature was a scale and verbal descriptions from tales. When the Summoner's Rift was constructed, the real Baron just dissappeared . What purple skinned, blue eyed creature just appeared in the League RIGHT after that? BOOMSummary:
Summarize: Title is pretty straight forward but I'll elaborate. I currently tank full clear hard modes in both EV and KP and my guild is currently 4/5 in Nightmare EV. As far as end game content goes I have seen it, at least enough to form, what I consider, valid opinions. Primarily for class balance in my guild, I am considering leveling a Guardian to replace my Vanguard. Also to take a break from raiding as I'm sick of having to ORDER people to CC and use their threat dumps, they aren't bad players, they are just too laid back at times. Every little thing effects tanking, and if you're making my job harder, I'm going to hate you, because you're making my healers job harder, and I like to look after my healers because they keep me from being dead. I fucked up 3rd phase Soa a couple of times the other night as well, which was pretty humbling, I have the utmost disgust for those pillars and an enormous amount of respect for tanks that can perfectly place Soa without missing a pillar, or taunt after mind trap. The camera is NOT my friend in that encounter. Anyway... Is Guardian fun to tank with? I have doubts about Vanguard threat, though it could just be my tunnel visioned DPS. I have one at level 20 and would love to see it to 50, the story looks solid and the companions I have so far are fantastic. However that all takes a backseat when making my decision as I hear a lot of talk about Guardians / Juggs being the underdog when compared to Vanguard / Powertech. Shadow tank is out of the question because we have too many already.Summary:
Summarize: HAHAHAHA, guys this was the most fucking pathetic thing that has ever happened. So I've got one of these urges right, like fuck. Somehow, my monkey brain convinces me to go look at some pictures, which obviously led to a video, then I'm like "just a couple strokes bro", don't worry nothing will happen < the biggest deception ever. Then I get aroused so quickly I'm like fuck, ok stop now, now now now. I stop and then its like OH SHIT man OH SHIT I can't hold this in, I'm gonna fucking premature ejaculate after like 20 seconds man, never have ever I ever felt so demasculated, nor have I lost this quickly. As it came out, I was just watching my dick unload itself, and started laughing hysterically, like almost dying. It was just like that, streak was broken. No war, no battle, just boom, I lost so quickly. It's like I lost to my monkey brain in chess through scholar's mate. It was sadly hilarious. All in the span of like 5 minutes, from the urge to the orgasm (wouldn't call it that, more like cum-release). Anyways bros, that monkey talking will try to convince you somehow that looking at 'the latest porn', 'just to be reminded', and all that rationalization is pure bullshit and a trick by your mind. You are your own worst enemy. This hilarious mistake tonight is probably one of the best experiences I could of asked for, I will never trust my mind with any of this bullshit again, I've gotten away with it a couple times but your mind is always out to get you. The best route to take after an experience like this is laugh, as you were fooled but you will not be fooled again! Feeling bad about relapsing is absolutely useless, no need to feel bad, you fucked up. Now you know, you regret doing it but you're better off now. Regret over remorse. This is all a process of learning bros, a process of learning about how your mind is out to get you. It's not just about the streak, it's about the discipline you have after you relapse. Do not relapse multiple times, this is the worst thing and its your monkey brain trying to drag you back into the darkness. Your mind WILL rationalize that 'since you already did it once, what difference does it make if I do it 8 more times today, I'll start the streak again tomorrow, what's the difference anyways'. This is DANGEROUS, you must realize that every single time you PMO you are fading to black. We all make mistakes, but continously making those mistakes is a sure-fire way to lose all motivation and all momentum. Anyways, best of luck and keep fighting bros. This isn't just about NoFap but about discipline. You are subconsciously disciplining your monkey mind each day that passes.Summary:
Summarize: This happened to my friend once, except he has irritable bowel syndrome so it probably couldn't be helped. After getting to atheon in a little less than an hour, we were stuck there for a bit with a team that really wasn't working too well together. So after like 15 attempts at atheon my friend is just like fuck this and says I'm gonna take a shit and leaves the fireteam. We all thought, great it's over now. But we kept trying with 5. Fail after fail, my friend comes back after about 20 minutes. Atheon was down that round so maybe all you have to do is drop a dookie and atheon will drop like a turd.Summary:
Summarize: the crucible is the biggest deus ex device in gaming since....i dont remember the last one. seriously wtf... also the endings..wtf, like Bioware took their cue from Deus Ex HR but just copy pasted it 3 times but changed the lighting of the explosion. at least with DXHR i felt the endings mattered, in ME3 it didnt seem to matter what you chose. the characters for ME3 was so bland, i just couldnt get myself to care about Ashley not like i did in ME1. EDI was a cool idea but she sucked balls as a character. the Prothean DLC guy absolutely DID NOT mattered at all, the only thing that i gained was his fucking rifle and even then i changed to the Vindicator at the end cuz it was better. the old characters were alright, nothing new in their story.Summary:
Summarize: When you are on birth control, you don't have normal periods - you have a withdrawal bleed caused by a dip in hormones. Hormones, particularly estrogen, can be stored in fat. So if you have been on birth control, your body has likely stored away excess hormones in your fat cells. Now that you are losing weight, your body is breaking down fat cells and using them for energy, thereby metabolizing the stored hormones and keeping your body from having a noticeable enough drop in hormones to keep you from having a withdrawal bleed.Summary:
Summarize: Had 2 tabs each earlier this night with my gf snd our friend. Went to a park which is located on a hill. The view to the city is amazing. I was laying next to a small(ish) lake. Pelicans, ducks and some other water birds chillin', swimming around there. And the frogs quacking. Holy fuck how trippy it is to hear hundreds or even thousands of frogs quacking simultainiously. I was tripping there for at least 2 hours straight. It was amazing. Finally got home. Had a shower, because it's so damn hot. Got into bed next to my gf. When I suddenly felt sick and had to vomit.(I tend to get really nauseaus indoors). Brushed my teeth and back to bed! My gf soon fell a sleep(she had to wake up 1.5 h later to go to work). So here I am, left alone with my thoughts. The fan in the corner of my room was making this sound. It's quite trippy tbh. I switch it off just to switch it back on 5 minutes later(because it's so damn hot here). Here I am thinking and going through all the apects of this life, my life. When I suddenly come to a conclusion that I have to quit smoking. It was time for my gf to wake up. We snuggled, had sex. I made her some coffee. She had a cigarette and drank her coffee(only the half of it, we have so many cups half full laying around at the place). Off she went. I'm laying in my bed as I write this, and I have to say: I feel fucking amazing! Just something I wanted to share with you guys.Summary:
Summarize: First of all those are very shitty Vape devices, if your gonna vape get something that will last a while and provide a good vape experience like the Aspire Premium Kit or something, or and Aspire Atlantis with a mech mod. Second do you smoke? if so the best argument is that you will be doing a far more healthy activity then smoking and it will generally cost less. If you do not smoke then why are you trying to get into vaping? Why can't you wait until you are 18? I am not against kids who are hooked on smokes switching to vape but if your not already a nicotine addict there is really no good reason to start especially when you won't be able to leave the house with it without getting crap from cops and random people when you use it in public.Summary:
Summarize: So my parents moved to Hawaii for 2 years for a job, and wanted someone to watch over their house. It just so happened that my friend wanted to get out of the state she was living in for most of her life, so I gave her the opportunity to move up to the lovely pacific northwest and rent out my parent's home (and the home I grew up in) for real cheap (200 a month, pretty bitchin deal right???) Now I know that my friend is a bit controlling, over emotional and moody as hell but I figure we can work through it and she can respect living in my home. This puts me in an awkward position because I have to play landlord to my friend. As soon as she gets here she starts arguing with me about how we're going to decorate the living room. She demands that she wants it to feel like home and not like she's away, I had to tell her that it was my living room too and she got all pissy. She gets angry when I spend time with my boyfriend. We got in another argument because of this, and she said that it was my responsibility to keep her company and entertained. As if she's still visiting or something. I let her know that I'm not going to put off my life because of her, and that if I did spend as much time home as she wanted me to, she would get sick of me. And low and behold, the weekends I stay home she starts being a bitch because she's sick of looking at me. At this point, I don't feel comfortable in my own home. I wake up, go to work or school, go to my boyfriends to spend a couple hours, and come home and hang out with her. But as soon as I walk through the door you can cut the air with a knife. It's like she's angry because I'm living my own life. She threatens to move back to her home state. I don't say anything to her because I don't really know why it's a threat. If she doesn't want to be here, then by all means quit torturing me and leave!!! I go out with her on weekends. I introduced her to my friends and even go and pick her up so she can chill with us and she's not stuck at the house. Just tonight when I got home from work and my boyfriends, she was in a pissy mood. The light in my bedroom burnt out the other day and so I ask her if she minds if i turn the light on in the living room (she's in there watching hulu on the computer). She huffs and puffs and ask me why I need to turn the light on, I say because it's dark in here and I need to do some work. She snaps back with, I HAVE A HEADACHE! So I say, um, okay and go back into my room and turn on the closet light to work by. She get's up, says, FINE YOU CAN HAVE YOUR LIGHT ON! and slams the door to her room. Any ideas on what to tell her? I guess I know what to say, but how do I approach her? This technically is my house while my parents are away and if she's going to continue to treat me like this would it be wrong to ask her to leave? EDIT: To make things clear, there is no written lease, only a verbal agreement and month to month rent. EDIT II: We just "talked." She started crying and playing victim. I told her that she needs to quit treating me like shit and quit making me feel unwelcome in my home. She says that I'm not "home enough" to make me feel "unwelcome..." but then goes on to explain how I come home at night, am home in the morning, and hang out with her on weekends. I think she's a little delusional. I told her if she didn't want to be here then she should move back to her home and she says that she "couldn't." She says she doesn't "have the money." The IRS is fucking her for not claiming her per cap (why the fuck she tried to pull on on the IRS, I don't know. This is the kind of person I'm dealing with.) and she still hasn't found a job despite being here for a month. Why? Because she's being picky. She doesn't even have a high school degree and she's trying to be picky. I can understand that she's getting cabin fever but, I'm done playing nice. EDIT III deleted the stuff about my light bulb because some of you are just as annoying and nitpicky as my roommate.Summary:
Summarize: Once I was in high school and a friend and I had planned a day at an amusement park. We went to pick up his friend (who I'd never met) and it turns out that she has a ridiculously strict mother. So my friend and I go inside to meet with the mom and convince her to let her daughter go with us. When we get inside I find out very quickly that this woman is very unpleasant and morbidly obese. She has someone lock up her chihuahua in another room and we start to talk to her about letting her daughter go out. Things are not going very well - the mother is busy being fat and cruel, her daughter is on the verge of tears, and my friend is trying to calm the situation down - when all of a sudden the fucking dog starts bouncing off the walls in the other room. I'm not sure what it was, but this was the perfect storm for me to break out into a nervous uncontrollable laughter. I'm just standing there laughing in front of this fat fuck and everybody is just staring at me. I just can't stop. I step outside and try to gather my composition, but when I head back in I lose it again. I will never forget the look on that woman's fat face.Summary:
Summarize: So, I didn't go to the rally and I don't know what the hell you're all talking about. Anyone have an inverse-Summary:
Summarize: No Regrets] I am a 21 year old woman, and my sister is 16. We both live at home with our parents, in a stable, devout Catholic household. We were never close, even in childhood, we each preferred the company of our brother (who is 19 and off at college) to each other. We're also completely different in every way- opposite personalities, opposite social abilities, opposite body types. For as long as I can remember we've never liked each other. I always resented her for needing so much attention, for being a brat despite never having been spoiled, for getting away with rudeness to our parents, and her constant destruction of the few things I owned. As far as I could tell, she resented me for being autistic, better behaved, and a poor example of an elder sister, who spent all my time reading alone instead of playing with her. Then it all changed when I was 14, and she was 9. That is when I started displaying signs of chronic depression, and was uncharacteristically angry and violent (and possibly suicidal). I would hit both my younger siblings- I never saw this as a problem, because both of them have always been stronger, heavier, and tougher than I ever was, and so I couldn't really inflict any lasting damage on them. Luckily, I've been on anti-depressants that remove most emotions ever since, which has eradicated any anger, although done nothing about the actual depression. Fast forward to about 2 years ago, when my sister also started to display signs of depression. Unlike me, who focused all my hatred towards myself, she focused all her hatred outward. Specifically at me. She rejected God, shaved half her head, insisted she was a lesbian and I was a hateful bigot for sticking with Catholic doctrine, adopted socialist political views, and dropped out of school for a year (she couldn't "handle it"), all of which really upset our Mom. And then 11 months ago, out of the blue, when we were home alone together (I was to "keep an eye on her"), she walks into my room and starts discussing abortion and gay "marriage". I am calmly rebutting all of her arguments, getting frustrated at her lack of understanding despite years of classes on Catholic teachings, and she gets angrier at my "bigotry". This leads to shouting, swearing, and eventually, she punches me in the face repeatedly, grabs me by my hair, throws me on the floor, and continues punching my face, insisting that I "killed her friend", who she had never mentioned ever before, who apparently had down syndrome, was raped by her cousin, and died because she couldn't get an abortion, and that it's all because of me, who voted Republican, and that I should be dead instead of her (the friend). Ignoring my incredible skepticism at this conveniently tragic story, about a friend who my mom didn't know about (she knows about everybody's friends), I started insisting that I don't know this person, and it's really sad that she died, but there's nothing that can be done about it, so why are you punching me? She eventually stopped, and I asked her to leave my room. She said no, so I demanded it. She still wouldn't. More shouting happened, and she started going on about how I was "the perfect child" to our parents and a "terrible role model" and her depression and hatred is all my fault, and since rebutting this is going nowhere, I at last get her to leave by picking up my flip phone and tell her that if she didn't leave my room, I'd call Mom, who was coming home from work at that point, and wouldn't she be so disappointed that one of her daughters beat up the other? this worked, and it was quiet. I cried for the first time in years, and I felt lucky I wasn't wearing my glasses, or I could have ended up with a huge gash in my head (like what happened to my brother when he ran into a wall by accident and his glasses cut into his forehead). Then the screaming started. It turns out my sister had, in the 5 minutes since the confrontation, swallowed a whole load of medications, and wouldn't let me help her, screaming while I was on the phone with 911 that I should let her die. One trip to the hospital and a week at a psych ward later, she was back, and fine. It's been nearly a year, and she's still hostile and angry. Last time I asked why she blames everything on me, she declared that I abused her (I do not remember this), and then went upstairs, as it turns out, to rip the head and limbs off the teddy bear I'd had for 12 years. We mostly try to avoid each other, but living in the same house, with mandated family dinners together every night, and now without our brother in the house as a buffer, that does not always work. I've discovered that alongside my fear of her (which my mom says is unreasonable), I have a difficult to place emotion, which I strongly suspect might be hatred for her. This terrifies me, as according to my religious beliefs, hatred is really really dangerous to one's soul. I have no idea what to do, but I feel I needed to get the whole story out to someone, as I have nobody to tell it to.Summary:
Summarize: I'm kind of in this boat too. Reading r/atheism, seeing all the crap in the news and wondering why the hell people who claim to have the moral high ground are so filled with hate. Granted, I've never been a great Christian, but the more time I spend in the real world (i.e. not at home with my parents) the more I see how absolutely backwards Christianity has become. My religion is hanging by a thread and I'm holding a pair of scissors wondering if I should cut it. It's completely stupid, the number of justifications I have to make to make Christianity as my parents believe work for me, and I'm not so sure I want to any more.Summary:

Summarize: Linux is all about choice, and no one is forcing you to use anything you don't want to. If you have a problem with Unity or Gnome 3 distros, then you have at least fifteen other options of distros to choose from that cater to your needs. Linux Mint developers have already stated that they have no plans to use Unity, so that may be a good option if Xfce isn't your cup of tea. I may not be a Linux noob (Arch User lol) but I personally agree with the design goals Canonical have been pursuing, as I rather love the quick search and attention to screen real estate (not to mention I rather love purple), and am proudly using Ubuntu 11.10 on my netbook. It's also worth noting that every reasonable person I've met who have tried Linux only recently and started with Ubuntu have had no problems and have even loved Unity. Target audience, anyone?Summary:
Summarize: Addiction to opiates is a crazy thing. You see once your body becomes used to having a certain amount, you need slightly less than that amount to feel normal. When I say normal, I mean how you would feel if you never took an opiate in your life. This is what makes opiate addiction awful. Your wasting all the money you have just to feel normal. This creates depression, and when you have a little extra money, instead of saving it to take care of yourself in the future, your depression makes you buy more than you need to feel normal, to get high to help yourself forget how much your fucking up your life. If you do this for a few weeks your new 'normal amount' has just increased. The only way to bring down your 'normal amount' is to go without and be sick for a day, people have busy lives. Some people can't just be sick for a day. As for suboxone. You can take 2mg and feel normal, if you take more than that, you feel slightly better. 4mgs makes you feel slightly better than normal. After that, the more you go up... there really isn't much of a difference of how you feel from 8mg to 32mg. That's just my opinion... I get in arguments with some people on this topic. And I also get many people to agree with me on this. Sub price on the street is like $10 for 8mg. From a pharmacy its about 12-15$ for 8mg. Oxycontin 80mg(when they still existed) average of $60 on the street. Heroin half a bundle(5bags)(*high quality) $60 Look at the prices. And the amounts, IMO they are equal in how they will take care of you for 24 hours. Obviously there are exceptions, and little differences, like how heroin doesn't last as long, but works much better when you first do it. For me I would need either a half bun, an oxy 80, or 8mg of suboxone. Every single day, or I would get really sick and want to die. Drug addicts can get extremely creative in how they make money. Now that I've been clean for this long, I don't do the awful things I used to do for money, but i'm living a much more full life. I hope this answers your question. I think I went off on a bit of a tangent here, so if you need me to elaborate on anything please just ask. EDIT andSummary:
Summarize: This will get buried, but once when I was about 25, my stepdad and I were on our way home in the last hour stretch of a road trip in his old beater of a pickup truck. My mom had been waiting up for us, and I think it was about 12:30 in the morning when we realized that we were about to run out of gas. We called AAA and they said they'd locate us and bring us some gas within the hour. As such, we pulled over and decided to call my mom to let her know we were going to be late. Then, my stepdad had the bright idea of playing a prank on her just to see what she would do. When I asked him what to say, he said "I don't know, just make something up!" So, I put my phone on speaker and dialed the number to my parents' house. She answered the phone and asked how everything was going. Said we needed to hurry up because she was tired of waiting and wanted to go to bed. Blah blah blah, bullshit for a minute, until I tell her "oh, we're going to be a little late because we ran out of gas and are waiting for AAA to show up." She asks what happened and we say we just misjudged how much gas it would take to get home, and forgot to stop at an appropriate point before there wouldn't be anymore gas stations for awhile. She flips out a little bit, asking if we're okay, which is normal I guess for moms who are just waiting for the rest of their family to join them safely in the nest. She was concerned about how much food and water we had, in case we had to sleep there all night (?? I don't even know), and during her billions of questions, it dawned on me: I told her -- "Mom, we're going to be fine. AAA said they'd be here in about 45 minutes, and that's plenty of time before the oxygen in the cab runs out. My stepdad crammed his fist in his mouth as best he could to stifle his laughter, because my mom audibly gasped and said "WHAAAT?? How long does that usually take?". So, I ran with it and said "It depends on the make and model of the vehicle, but since this is an old truck, it has a failsafe mechanism that when the gas tank is emptied, all the windows and doors lock and seal so they can't be opened. At some point that means that if there are people inside, they'll run out of air. We're guessing we have about 90 minutes before we should start getting worried." At this point, she is totally crying and we are barely able to contain our cackling, because she starts giving us tearful, desperate tips on how to conserve oxygen: "Try to take slow, shallow breaths! Or go to sleep!" "Don't talk on the phone too long or you'll use up the oxygen faster!" "If worse comes to worst, just break the window!" Anyway, by the end of it she's hysterically crying and begging to talk to my stepdad, since she believes it's possible it'll be the last time she ever talks to him. Tears are absolutely rolling down his face, and he does his best to regain his composure long enough to pretend like he's really worried and will really miss her if anything bad happens. He starts telling her how much he loves her and has been thankful for all the years they've spent together, that she changed his life and he could never love anyone else as much as her. I am positively DYING by this point, because he's incorporated a skillful wheeze into the conversation after every other word, which is serving the dual purpose of driving my mom completely batshit with worry and myself deeper into the throes of laughter. After about 20 minutes of them having this super heartfelt conversation, the AAA guy shows up. My stepdad, without thinking, rolls down the window to talk to the guy, and my mom could hear it happening over the phone. All of a sudden she screams "WHAT THE FUCK?!" and my stepdad and I are completely helpless to the power of how funny it was. We burst out laughing so hard and tried to breathlessly explain what we told her to the AAA guy, who also started laughing. After she heard that, she was PISSED. She started screaming obscenities at us and told us not to even bother coming home because she would call the police. When we finally got there, she had taken all of the winter boots and shoes out of the hall closet, scattered them all over the foyer, and turned all the lights off so that we'd trip over them and fall on our faces when we got in the door. It has never, ever stopped being the funniest thing that has ever happened to our family. There were other incidents too, just not as good as that one. She didn't talk to either of us for a week after that. It was hilarious.Summary:
Summarize: Hello. This is going to be a long wall of text but I'll try to keep it as short as possible. I live in Belgium and have been going to a youth group (don't know how to say it in English, kind of like the Boy Scouts but only for people of 16 and older and we do other stuff) since I was 16 and I'm a leader now of my town group and head leader of the agglomeration we are in. We had different 'cliques' before I became a leader, I was in a major clique and was the only one chosen to become group leader last year of my clique. All the other new leaders came from the other major clique. So it was a lot different for me but I've been adapting and began friendly relations with those other people. I thought I did well, I did my job and was frequently told by the senior group leaders that I am very good at what I do. Last week we went away with all the younger group leaders to prepare for our yearly camp. It was a lot of fun and I thought I had made a lot of progress with all the other junior leaders... The past weekend however, I had a bit of a fall-out with my girlfriend, who is also in our youth group but not a leader. I know things solve themselves normally so we just let eachother be for the weekend and we did other stuff. She went out with the other junior leaders, which I don't mind. When the weekend was over, several younger members (mostly new people) that aren't leader came over to me and started talking to me about how bad the other junior leaders were gossiping about me. I was shocked and asked what happened and apparantly they were trying to start a fight with me and my girlfriend. A list of quotes: 'you should dump him first, if he dumps you he'll boast about it against the rest and you'll feel bad' 'He hasn't done his job lately and we have to pick up the mess after him' -> a straight out lie that will affect my relationship with younger members for a long time if they believe it... 'He's far too ambitious' <- not true. I didn't even run in the elections for head leader of the agglomeration, I was picked by the members of the agglomeration council with an 80% approval rate... other than that I haven't once outed ambitious pretences. So me and my girlfriend kissed and made up, like we always do, and she told me all that I heard was true and that they're also trying to set her up with another member of the leadership when she dumps me. I honestly don't know what to do now. I always thought I did my job well but apparantly they think different. Is this jealousy? How do I go about it? Simply avoiding them is a no-go. All the senior group leaders quit next year and the juniors go to seniors (me included). I love this hobby, it's the thing I spend the most time on next to work and I love the sports we do. Do I talk to them about this? I have a meeting with them later tonight and I feel anxious as hell... I haven't slept for days and honestly it's affecting me a lot...Summary:
Summarize: TommyPickles1987 is faggot_emo_kid and I will tell you the story of how this all came abut: faggot_emo_kid used that username for his reddit account for 8 months and generated a good amount of karma. He posted this on reddit, and it was upvoted to the high heavens instantly. Being more of a 4chan user, he just posted this without thinking about his username being an issue. Keep in mind the letter and money are more than likely legitimate, and this issue of the stolen charizard card is probably known by various other people. The OP got in contact with his friends who were there during the theft, and directed them to the reddit post instead of the 4chan post. His friends from his past looked at it saw the post, but couldn't help but notice the username. With this picture also being on facebook, many people he is friends with IRL had access to his reddit account, including the person who sent him the letter. With a large number of his comments being racist comments in r/circlejerk, it led me to the conclusion that the person who sent the letter is an African-American (Let's call him Tim) individual who has recently turned his life around. Tim saw faggot_emo_kid's post and a number of his past racist posts in r/circlejerk, and realized that OP was not the type of person he thought he was. Tim confronted the OP, and told a few other people about what he found on reddit, and so TommyPickles1987, formerly known as faggot_emo_kid, needed a way to quickly cover his tracks. He then came up with the brilliant idea of salvaging his reputation IRL, and on reddit. He makes a new username that he knows people will love, and posts this bogus story. He posts 2 separate links that he knows will be instantly upvoted, and makes sure to comment as much as he can, so he can go ahead and collect both comment and link karma that was not accumulated from r/circlejerk. Ladies and Gentlemen of reddit, what took place here was a karma heist, a very well thought out karma heist, that was nearly foolproof.Summary:
Summarize: This same situation happened to my buddy and I except with the opposite end result. We had been trying to meet to set up camp up near the airfield after i lost my character a while back. When we finally met, my friend decided to scout out the hill we were near. Unfortunately a survivor with a Winchester was waiting for him and I at the top. He popped my friend after my buddy managed to spray him with a clip, but it was too late when I shot, he had already logged out. I searched the rest of the area to make sure he had no allies waiting to ambush me and found no one. I was then going to set up camp nearby to put my buddies gear in the tent, when I got popped in the back of the head. Needless to say I was pretty pissed. Alt-F4'ers really make me mad, granted that that is how I was killed the first time.Summary:
Summarize: You'd be surprised how easy it is to accidentally show nudes of yourself to family members. Occasionally I cut my own hair. I'm black so I have that kinky hair and when I cut it I usually buzz off 99% of it. But when you're cutting it that short, it's very noticeable if one spot isn't as even as another. Think of it like shading with a pencil and pressing harder in one area than another. Being a stereotypical young dude, the only mirror I had was the mirror on my wall. So getting the back even was a little more difficult. I'd just use my phone and either snap pictures of myself, or the back of my head through the mirror just so I could see everything looked normal. This would also be done naked so I could just hop in the shower when I'm done to wash off any hair bits. One time... I forgot to delete these photos. Fast-forward to some arbitrary time in the future. I'm out with my family + aunt, uncle and some cousins. I'm showing my aunt, who is a fairly proper quietish person, some photos on my phone and just give her my phone to go through them. She got quiet and just gave my phone back rather quickly and I thought nothing about it. A few weeks later, I'm going through my phone and I come across these photos of me taking photos of myself naked in front of a mirror and burst out laughing. The leading one was taken from up behind my head so you got to see my whole backside, and the reflection of my front side in the mirror. Now it's a funny family story.Summary:
Summarize: This happened last night, not today. Warning wall of text. Sorry for my bad writing skills, I have never been a good writer Some background information. My Grandpa is in his mid 70s and for the longest time he has wanted an iPad. About 2 years ago my father caved in and bought him one. The biggest problem with him having an iPad is, he doesn't really know how to use it. So when a problem arises he calls my dad to come over and "fix" it or he brings it over to the house. As of recently my dad has given me the task of fixing the iPad. Yesterday was Yom Kippur and traditionally my Grandparents come over to the house for break the fast. When my Grandpa arrived he told me there was a problem with his iPad and I told him I would fix it. He explained to me that he needed to change the credit card that was linked to his Amazon account. So I took the iPad into the other room to sit on a chair and opened up Safari. And you know what he had open? PORN. I assumed my Grandpa accidentally tapped on a ad and didn't realise it. I went to delete the tab, but I had to bring up every other tab that was open. And every other tab was PORN. Gay porn, Straight porn, Lesbian porn and much more. I rushed to tap on private browsing which deletes all the tabs, but he was already in private browsing. At this point I realised that my Grandpa was aware of what he was doing, it wasn't an accident. I was so freaked out that I had to put the iPad down for a minute and gather myself. I minute later I went to Amazon and fixed the problem. While waiting for the page to load, I looked at his favorites at the top of the page. Half were porn, half were baseball stuff. I finally gave the iPad back to my Grandpa and he asked me to explain what I did so he can fix it in the future. After explaining I went to the bathroom to wash my hand (just to be safe no unwanted chemicals were picked up while handling the iPad). Then it hit me. This explains a few things that happened to me as a child. While over at my Grandparent's house when I was in 4th grade. I went on their computer to go YouTube and it suggested YouPorn instead. I assumed that my prepubescent self searched this up in the past and didn't delete the history. Now having seen YouPorn open on my Grandpas iPad, I knew it was him who went on the website. Another event was an email I got from my Grandpa in 5th grade. It said "Check out my pink car". I opened the email and there was a picture of a hot girl on a pink car. As I scrolled down the girl started to strip down and rub her tits on the car. I freaked out when I saw this and immediately deleted the email and even deleted it from the trash. I later asked my Grandpa if he sent me an email about his pink car, but he claimed he didn't know what I was talking about. So at the time I thought it was a spam email that got through. Nope, it was an email my grandpa was sharing with his friends. Here's the worst part of this story. I know that my dad knows there is porn on my Grandpas iPad. My dad has fixed the iPad in the past and once when I started to fix the iPad, my Dad took it away from me saying "I have to do it this time" when I was going on Safari. Even though my dad knew there was porn on my Grandpas iPad, he let me see it. Thanks Dad.Summary:
Summarize: Happened last week, so LWIFU. This girl started at my high school (senior year) at the start of this year. Since the moment I saw her, I was in awe. She's absolutely stunning and has a personality to suite. The problem is, she has been dating a guy since just before she came to me school. This guy, however, is a massive tool. Not saying that from a jealous want-to-be lover kind of thing; he's genuinely not a nice person. I've never seen them happy together. So queue me bitching about how she's so amazing to my best mates, and how I really like her. Oh well, she's taken, thoughts suppressed. Fast forward to last Monday; we talk as we have done a fair bit at school and she messages me in the afternoon on Facebook. She tells me she really likes me and has since she first saw me. Great. I tell her I really like her. Great. She's still with her boyfriend. Not so great. After a school function later that week, she drops me home and chills for a bit while we talk about everything; she doesn't want to be with her boyfriend but doesn't want to break up at the same time. So after a sold few hours of talking, she gets up to go, and I pull her back and kiss her, and she kisses back. She grabs her stuff, mumbling "Why did you have to do that..?" and we said our goodbyes. Now she's really confused and I'm confused and I'm sitting here sleepless as I think about her and I don't know what to do because I'm really impatient when it comes to these things.Summary:
Summarize: If you want to be happy for the rest of your life never make a pretty woman your wife. So from my personal point of view get an ugly girl to marry you.Summary:
Summarize: Do you get overwhelmed by real life? Skyrim is simpler. So it really isn't a problem. The game doesn't have a learning curve because its a sandbox. You can do anything, but you don't have to do anything - which is the beauty of it. You can't be overwhelmed if all you gotta do is do whatever it is that you want to do!Summary:
Summarize: but that's the thing. many feminists (at least in my experience) just want to lose what they don't like, and keep everything else. for example, if women achieved equal pay, it would a great victory, but if they were included in the draft, it would be a tragedy and a war on women. i realize this isn't representative of the entire feminist population, but in my experience, there is a fair number of them. it pisses me off to no end when they want to be treated "like a lady" but the second you use the word bitch, they go into a rant about how that demeans women. what i'm trying to say is that they only want things level where it benefits them, i suppose you could say they want to have their cake and eat it too, and then bitch about how as women, it demeans them to make cakes.Summary:
Summarize: Totally agree 100% but I will give daily upvotes for a year to anyone who can find any retail company of Walgreen's size who doesn't have someone who has been there for 18+ years who doesn't abuse some privilege the company gives. Again, I totally think this is shitty of Walgreens and personally think they have many more issues than a single $1.39 bag of chips and this single instance. My injection was simply we don't have enough details and blasting away at Walgreens really solves nothing. I speak with my wallet and I choose not to shop at Walgreens.Summary:
Summarize: I was driving a commercial truck in NJ. Some dick was ass-hurt by my merging onto the highway at 50 MPH in a 55 MPH zone. (What can I say, it was a really slow truck.) The dick was doing 75 in the slow lane. He waited until the last second to slam on his brakes and honk his horn at me. And then, all road rage style, zoomed around me, cut me off and slammed the brakes. So I, of course, slowed down and changed lanes. He cuts me off again and hits the brakes. Again I slowed down and changed lanes. He does it again. The 4th time he does this I don't slow down, remain at my top speed of 62 MPH (slow ass truck!). He comes within 3 feet of my front bumper. I signal to bring it on, macho style, with a wave of my hand. Fully calling his bluff, and having gotten my message across that I was not slowing down again and an accident was OK with me, he flips me the bird and zooms off. Wish I had an iPhone back then...Summary:
Summarize: I usually fix my car myself but when my car died on the highway I had trouble figuring out it was the distributor that needed replacing. from the highway I had it towed to a garage because I had no time to fix a car and went to get the car the next day. The guy replaced the distributor a $150 part. He charged me $800. I explained that I know how to fix cars and I know the prices of parts because I have replaced a distributor before. Not even 10 minutes of politely saying "fuck you" and he charges me $200. That is still a $100 profit for that garage but I was happy with that price, paid and left. I've rebuilt engines, replaced suspensions, gutted interiors and fixed rusted floorpans, replaced multiple brake systems, built a turbo system for my current car and I'm currently doing a headgasket on that car so I do know my shit for the most part. I just could not believe the first time in years I don't fix my car myself I get that shit pulled on me. never again will I go to a garage for anything I can do myself.Summary:
Summarize: Hi LoL community. This will make me look like an attention manwhore but I've been going through tough times lately. Very tough times actually. At some point I even considered suicide :/. It seemt like everything was going wrong. Only when I was reading this subreddit or when I was playing LoL i could get my mind off of things. Laughing at tits or ass man and ponto1 aka horny darius, reading AMA's, made me feel like I was actually included, like I had friends when I was sure I lost them all. I can go on and on but I don't want to bore people that actually read all this. Thank you so much for being such a great group of people.Summary:
Summarize: We had a strange girl in our 6th grade (12 year old kids) gym class. She was very popular and outgoing, but she was always getting into some kind of trouble (sent away to boot-camp for misbehaving kids, proudly came back to school in an orange jumpsuit.) Anyway, out of nowhere she strips to her training bra and panties and starts humping a bench and says how awesome sex is, and her new boyfriend had sex with her in the butt the other day. The following week, she came to gym class, we all got changed, she stripped to her bra and panties again and started doing a stripper dance... she had CARVED her boyfriend's name into her skin (both legs) with a knife. I've seen a variety of self inflicted wounds and self-injury... but this was CARVED, as in 'she's going to still have these scars when we're 80 years old and in a nursing home' carved. I was like WTF, and all the other girls tried to ignore it, her friends thought it was cool because it reminded them of tattoos. I found out later that day that her new boyfriend was 22, and even though all the other kids thought that was extremely cool, I was beyond horrified. I didn't really think to tell an adult though, because the girl was ridiculously violent and I had no doubt in my mind she would either send kids to jump me or she would bring a knife to school and hurt me herself. She went missing two years later, and I recently found her on facebook. She had a kid around that time. The dad is mysteriously not in the picture, and she insists that he died/ran off/joined the army/moved to Canada... the story always changes. That's more sad than anything though...Summary:
Summarize: Cloning bitcoin and making this new currency a "token" for all ebay purchases can be a very smart move from ebay. They can make shit load of money, and if they'll make it open source they can convince bitcoin miners to join their network.Summary:
Summarize: I'm sittin here in front of my house after a smoke sesh with friend he had to take off but not after givin my a dime free:) anyways. I'm here at a [6] getting eatin by Mosquitos. When a wild raccoon appears!!! It sniffed at my tie shoes for a minute looked at me and walked about 5 steps away from me. Turned around and glared at me. The left. Scare the shit outa me.Summary:
Summarize: One time I came home and couldn't find my cat, I didn't think much of this; as you all know, cats frequently do their own thing and come out when they want to be seen. I went into the kitchen to grab a quick snack. As I reached into the fridge I froze, what was that sound? Meh, it's probably just the house creaking. But wait, it happened again; it was coming from inside the walls... I am not the superstitious type, but this was starting to freak me out. I decided to investigate, leaving the kitchen and turning down the adjacent hallway. As I closed in on the source of the scurrying sounds a voice broke the silence, "mrrrrrRRRROOOOWWWWwwwwww, mreeoow". What the hell, where was my cat!? I looked around, there was no sign of him. He meowed again. Still no cat in sight. I looked down towards the large ventilation next to my bedroom, inside two cute, albeit scared, eyes stared up at me from the darkness. I briefly stood there in shock, then went into the garage to get a screwdriver so I could remove the vent and let him out. Took me a little while to figure out how he got in there, but eventually I figured it out. There is a unfinished room in the basement of the house, inside it is a small 2 person sauna, beside it a bunch of boxes of things in storage. The cat climbed up the boxes, on top of the sauna, along the top of the open door, into the roof of the room, and finally into the ventilation system which had no cover on it there. I have no idea how long the little guy was trapped in there but he has yet to attempt it again.Summary:
Summarize: What's with all these people saying sex wasn't good enough the first time. Of course it wasn't, you sucked at it. Sex isn't some crazy short cut to satisfaction, it's an exercise that you get better at the more you do it, and it gets better depending on how intimate you are with your partner, how open and confident you are (if your always nervous it never gets good, which is a huge problem in the world if this subreddit is any indication) and how good you are.Summary:
Summarize: Yes, and don't forget to record it. We need this as evidence. Anything they say can and will be used against them. Though I may seem rude, I just want to get my sister out of the SJW crowd, and I am right now building up evidence and counterevidence. I wait for the day she returns home. (Even though she says she isn't a radical, she shares some of the views. Which doesn't make sense, since she is a white girl raised in a upper middle class family. She seems so focused on sexism, even though she is treated like a princess by her dad. At one point when I tried to talk to her to say I have depression, she goes "Warpstealer, you don't know how depressed I am, so why do you get to complain") I miss the days when we would both be interested in video games(now she says games are "too hard"), both be social (during a family reunion, she spent most of her time in the condo looking at tumblr, saying "there are too many guys, so I don't feel like hanging out with them"), and even do guyish things (now all she cares about is "female interests").Summary:
Summarize: yoooo fam. So I'm growing my hair out to be pretty long and I'm in a pretty awkward stage of length now! It just looks super 'moppy' at the moment. The bangs are about to my nose, and the side just lays over my ears, not quite to ponytail length (Which is the basic goal). So my question to you guys is, what the fuck can I do with my hair to make it look better? I just push it to the bangs to the side so its not straight down! Thank you!Summary:
Summarize: If its the one I think that it is, basically an actor and two kids were beheaded by a helicopter stunt. It was a stupid stunt, and there were a metric fuck ton of other problems with the production which have been tied back to the director.Summary:
Summarize: Being depressed is a really awful thing. You shut down and stop being so outgoing. If you're already an introvert people don't notice what has happened because its a series of really small changes to your lifestyle. But that's the key. No one notices. And that nasty little voice starts echoing in the back of your mind and you recognize it. But by now you're trapped. you've forgotten how to live without depression and you begin sabotaging your own attempts to beat it. Your failures are the only thing that echo in your mind. "You're worthless" you tell yourself, "You can't succeed at anything." Your hobbies and passions lose their luster and stop being enjoyable. You're filled with despair and crippling sense of loss and defeat with no way out.Summary:
Summarize: I actually tried that this past saturday. I haven't ever tried it before, and now i don't think i will again. Next morning my friend tells me that she one of those girls thats quiet at a party and has a boyfriend, who both work at the same place as 3 of my friends. She is now being called a slut by all 3...Summary:
Summarize: I'm a guy of slightly larger than the "average" genital size (~6.5-7" length, 4.5" - 5" circumference)going by wiki , but just a bit over. The smallest porn star would easily put me to shame. Even so, if I wear standard-sized condoms my bits get so constricted width-wise that I can only wear them for a short time without being in real pain. They almost act like a cock-ring(keeping all the blood inside and keeping me erect even after intercourse) but a cock-ring that is too small. I've tried trojan/durex/lifestyles and just about any other brand of regular sized condoms I can find in stores. The only couple I've tried that actually seem to fit properly are Trojan Magnum, lifestyles "XL", or lifestyles SKYN "XL" I think they are called. Buying them has problems too because of the stereotypical person that buys a magnum condom (the usually young, immature type that wants to show everyone he has a big dick, sharing it on facebook and anywhere else he can post a picture). Even in the military I think it was they had to reissue condoms with sizes renamed because the soldiers would only take magnum-sized condoms when passed out for free which lead to the magnums running out and no one taking the regulars. There is also a great deal of hate both off and on the internet for anyone buying magnums b/c hate the above-mentioned stereotypical buyer and people feel the standard size fits all because condoms can stretch. Well, yes, they might stretch if you apply some real force to them, but they don't stretch like that simply by putting them on your penis. Does anyone else have this particular problem? Are there condoms out there that are just a bit wider without me needing to buy the less-than-modest Magnum packaging?Summary:
Summarize: Nah. My mum is in her mid -50s and is still relatively slim and in better shape that plenty of women my age (mid-20s). She didn't even get any significant amount of cellulite until she hit her early 40s, and now in her mid-50s she has maaaaaybe as much as the average woman my age. Maybe even less. It can be done, unless she's secretly a Freak Of Nature^TM and never told us about it. But I'm more inclined to believe it's because she's stayed active throughout her life and is eats fairly healthy.Summary:
Summarize: You know what though? If you break the law, you go to jail. Its that simple. If you're overseas, and you break their laws... ...you go to jail. Usually overseas. It's not difficult to understand. Pussy Riot are obviously bending and breaking laws all the time, so what do you expect? They deserve to be in jail because they broke the law. They deserve to be in a Russian jail because they were stupid enough to go to Russia, and break Russian laws. I'm not saying that Russian jails are fair, or humane...and I'm not saying they aren't. In all honesty, I don't know. I'm not Russian. But that's why I wouldn't risk it like these people did. Do they deserve the treatment they have received in jail? Probably not. But they made conscience decisions to end up there. So its their on stupid fault.Summary:
Summarize: I'm a twenty-four year old female and my boyfriend and I are becoming more and more serious as time goes on. We have been together for one year now. Here is the problem: his brother, who he lives with, is an absolute asshole. Before going on to describe why this is such a problem for me, I want to talk a little more about his brother, who I will call Josh. Josh regularly describes the shitty ways he treats women and the shitty ways he tries to sleep with as many women as possible. Now, while I don't necessarily think it's bad to sleep with a lot of people (if it's consensual and done respectfully on both parts), he intentionally manipulates women to get what he wants and then is really mean to them after things are over. He admitted to having left a girl in the middle of the woods when she was high on ecstasy and he was drunk (he was driving) because she annoyed him and he no longer felt like getting in her pants. Another example: this summer he knew this one girl who he had met online wanted a relationship from her online profile, yet he went out on a date with her solely for the intention of having sex with her and never sleeping with her again. He hadn't slept with anyone in four months, so he really just wanted to get laid. Now I know a lot of people do this, and I can understand his sexual frustration, but the way he did it was really shitty. He slept with her, then the next day talked to my boyfriend and I about how fat she was and how disgusting she was and what bad lay it was. These things are possible, but the way he discusses them is rude and uncalled for. It's simply indicative of his general disrespect for women. He has a technique he has called the "machine gun makeout" which is basically to keep leaning in to kiss a woman, and each time she turns away, he tries again, and keeps trying until she gives in. He combines this technique with his "drink technique" of buying girls a drink, letting them drink half, then slamming the rest himself and buying them another one. This one is based on the theory that girls drink the first half of their drink really fast and the last half slow. He is honestly this manipulative. One time Josh made a pass at me about two months after his brother and I were official and I (obviously) turned him down. I told him "I couldn't be less attracted to you given your shallow personality", yet when I told his brother about it Josh claimed I had been wanting him all along and was asking for it. Josh spends all his days off work smoking weed, drinking, and trying to use more women for sex. I don't have any problem with weed and drinking, but both of those things are pretty much all he ever does. He has no ambition. No wish to find someone he cares about and settle down. No wish to ever have kids. He just wants to go to work and then party on his days off. Lastly, Josh is terrible with money. He makes almost $100k a year but lives paycheck to paycheck, spending it all on buiyng more "toys" (e.g. dirtbike, jetboat, truck). Again, I'm not against buying nice things for yourself as long as you budget and save for the future. He once asked me (I'm in medical school), "What kind of STUFF are you going to buy once you are a doctor?" I told him that I was going to buy a house first of all, and he laughed and said, "NO. COOL stuff! Mercedes? Mustang?" He really doesn't understand that there are things to life other than money. He asked my boyfriend to go half and half on a mortgage so they could buy a house together. I did not give my opinion because I felt it was none of my business, but was secretly SO relieved when my boyfriend told him no. I think it's a terrible idea to enter into such a long-term financial commitment with someone who is hugely in debt and can't hold onto money even with a great paying job. Anyways... back to the beginning. I hate this person more than I've ever hated anyone. I haven't described the half of it because I want to keep this short enough for people to read, but I hope you can understand the situation. My question is... would this be a dealbreaker for anyone? Up until this point in the post I haven't talked about my relationship with my boyfriend, but let me just say it is INCREDIBLE. Amazing communication. Amazing sex. We are seriously perfect partners. He makes me laugh so much that I cry sometimes. But sometimes I imagine the future and I feel sick. His brother's financial habits seem to influence him somewhat. He isn't as terrible as Josh is, but he definitely doesn't save money. I am a huge saver (seeing as how I had to put myself through medical school) and I could see those mentalities conflicting. Also if we have kids one day... his brother will be their uncle. And I couldn't keep the kids away from his brother, that would be unfair to my boyfriend. So my hypothetical children would be influenced by this man (who trust me, will never change - he never wants to get married or have children, so he will always be that creepy uncle josh). I think it would be even worse if I had boys because he would want to do things with them and teach them his "techniques" with women. It makes me want to punch something imagining these children who don't even exist yet having to be around this man who I despise with a passion. So anyways. Despite this perfect relationship with my boyfriend, do you think this sort of thing (hating one of his family members so much) could ruin it? I know that typical answers on this thread are "end it, move on", but I would appreciate some input other than that because it's not realistic. It seems silly to end a great relationship because of someone who isn't even one of the members of the relationshp. It should just be about me and my boyfriend, right? At this point it's easy to ignore his brother as we're doing distance while I finish my last year of medical school. But at some point in the next year we will be hopefully living close by again and I will once more have to deal with his brother on a regular basis since they live together. And potentially deal with his brother for the rest of my life. This pains me. Any thoughts would be appreciated, especially if anyone has ever been in a similar circumstance!Summary:
Summarize: I'm incredibly sorry for your loss. I am incredibly thankful for even the smallest relationship with my father, and if he passed away so quickly, I imagine it would be that much more special to me. What made me realize how mentally unstable my mother really was happened one night during the middle of their nasty divorce: Basic story is that she and my younger sister, who has never gotten along with her, were arguing over ___ thing sister did. Mom is pissed because lack of respect, she have birth to her, etc. Within an hour my mother had her cornered, about to beat the shit out of her with the buckle end of a belt. I come in, interrupt, take the welts for my sister and get slapped across the face a few times when I confront mom about her sudden, very dramatic personality change over the past month or two. Sum-up: who the fuck are you? I don't even fucking know you anymore! Talking to a parent like that probably isn't okay, although I was full of love and betrayal as I said it, not hatred or malice. She slaps me a few times and then storms off. Comes in later to check my face and make sure she didn't leave any marks. More fucked up shit happens, drama drama, end story is that my dad came home as soon as he found out what was going on, took us into the yard to explain what happened, then took us to the police station the next day to file a report about it. I had a sizable welt and bruise from the belt buckle, but no other -physical- marks. That night I lost 16 years of brainwashed goddess-level adoration for the insane thing that is my mother. I also gained a newfound and desperately needed respect and love for my father, who I'd privately referred to as my 'sperm donor' as per my training beforehand. Salt in the wounds: the courts didn't even bother sentencing her to a mandated psychological screening , despite all of the mind-meltingly obvious shit I told them she did to herself and to me for 16 years. Fuck Arkansas court systems.Summary:
Summarize: And what, waste police time and resources on a 30 minute lecture for a man-child living with his parents? I've seen this happen before; it's a massive embarrassment for the family and a waste of the cop's time to drive all the way to the kid's house and give a stern talking to. The tax dollars that we earn might as well be burned if it is funneled down on trivial shit like this--much is on the parent for not raising him in the right direction. A cop is not a nanny following around dysfunctional families getting a fuckup together because someone skipped out on parenting the kid's life. What is harming the kid even more is allowing him the stay in the house. If the parent truly wishes her son to become independent, then she should slowly cut ties with him and gradually force him to move out. Now of course the man-child should've been mature enough to move out on his own, but if he was never nurtured mentally by the parent at a young age, then of course his mindset will be rigid at the high school level.Summary:
Summarize: I disagree, the media sensationalized the demands of a few (non-Christian) religious extremist over the years which led to a real impact in our culture and outraged native Quebecers. I can think of two example which marked me. First is the removal of Christmas ornaments and the native scene from the town hall because a few Muslim extremist demanded their religious symbol must be displayed. [Nativity scene removed from Montreal-area town hall]( The other is the Jewish synagogue who petitioned the YMCA gym in Montreal to have their windows tinted because children should not be exposed to woman public ''nudity''. [Synagogue's complaints prompt gym to tint windows, angering athletes]( The immigrants come from all over the world with each their own set of values. At this moment, the vocal minorities demand that the laws and values of the province be modified to accommodate them. Where do you draw the line?? I believe this is her attempt to draw this line while trying to keep the national identity. I'm not defending Pauline Marois and I sure as hell don't envy her position. How do you please the minorities while keeping the majority happy?Summary:
Summarize: Hi Reddit, First post here so I hope I do everything right. I should make a quick note that he only does the physical abuse when he's angry. In the beginning, our relationship was great, nothing was wrong and we go along like any happy couple. I'd say the verbal abuse started around 6 months ago, this is when he'd shout right at me and shout every bad name under the sun at me when something has upset him...he's admitted that nearly every time wasn't my fault he was angry but I was the only person there to take it out on? Next came the physically abuse, this started about 2-3 months ago. First it was little things like pinning me down or shoving me out of the way but it has quickly progressed to physically grabbing me hard, screaming in my face, head butting me hard several times, kicking me in the stomach and grabbing and even pulling out my hair. This abuse leaves me with many bruises and black eyes. The next day, I don't know how he's going to act. He could be really apologetic and ashamed of what he's done or he could be really cold, distant, refusing to apologise and even blaming me for what he's done. Now the emotional abuse, everything always is my fault no matter what. If I'm feeling down or sad for some reason, he'll make me feel guilty for being sad, twist it round on him so he can feel sad so I have to forget about my feelings and care about him. He'll also play mind games with me such as getting a laugh out of making me cry, laugh at me and then patronisingly tap me on the back saying it will be okay. In the past he's said things including "You're a pile of shit" " I don't owe you anything" "I hope you get run over" and even going as far as saying " if you don't move out the way, I'll grab you and put you in the traffic". He always tells me my feelings and opinions are wrong and he's right. It's really breaking me down slowly, yes I love this guy and yes I want to help him but there's only so much a person can take. It seems like he can do whatever he wants to me and I am expected to forgive him but I do the slightest thing wrong (which can include spilling a drop of water on the floor) he'll continue to "punish" me until I'm literally begging him to stop. This punishment includes neglecting any form of physical contact, doesn't care or notice how I feel, and doesn't show any empathy regardless how much I'll apologise and beg. I hate being ignored so obviously he does this to upset me even more. When I'm upset, usually about something he's done to me he tells me to deal with my problems myself, he doesn't want to be there or help me and that I should grow up without even a hug or kiss. When he's upset me, I'll do whatever I can to get it back to normal which includes apologising, making him food and cakes and just overall being nice even though he doesn't deserve it and it's because I'm scared of him. When he's angry at me and taking it out on me, I'll let him and try to calm him down because I hate seeing him upset. The one occasion that really upset me is that my grandad recently passed away and it was a really hard day for me, I admit I was emotional and slightly grouchy but he can't deal with that. He twisted it round, made the whole day about him and acted like my feelings didn't even matter. Yep, on the day of my grand dads funeral, he got violent with me and made me feel even worse about myself. One day he can be the nicest person ever, being really nice to me, buying me presents, hugging me, wanting to get close and overall being an amazing boyfriend that I know he is deep down. But other days he can be completely different by getting violent, getting moody, being distant, cold and uncaring and it's frustrating trying to adapt my mood and my feelings to his personality that day. This relationship really is destroying everything I've got. It's destroyed my confidence, self worth and overall made me feel nothing more than a walking skeleton. I feel so broken, now when he gets angry I just apologise straight away because no matter what I say it will always be my fault. I should mention that we do live together and he's got quite a stressful job. Please help me reddit, what can I do to help him?Summary:
Summarize: Try to keep this as short as possible... I met my boyfriend, John, when he came to my small private school in the 7th grade. We immediately clicked (both came from poor/ broken families in a pool of rich kids) and became great friends, even flirting sometimes. Over the course of the year he asked me to be his girlfriend twice (I said no both times- he was kind of dorky and didn't want to get made fun of by my friends- also I had dated the popular guy for all of 6th grade, named Ryan). Still, we hung out outside of school, going to movies, etc. He stopped talking to me once it became Summer. In 8th grade he became much cooler, and had a lot of friends (friends i used to be friends with). I was a bit jealous. I heard he had "felt up" this girl, Aby, that I used to be good friends with. The rest of the year went by and I think he noticed me / had some interest in me but nothing like before. So begins 9th grade, and he asked out another one of my good/ best friends. They "dated" for just a few days... it was more just a stupid high school thing than anything. Months later, me and John became very close again. I had a lot of pursuers and got asked out by 3 guys. John finally asked me out again in January 2010. I said yes, very happy. He said "third time's the charm". Everything seemed perfect. We made love for the first time (each other's first everything) in the summer of 2010. He had gotten kicked out of my small private school, and was going to school for 10th grade an hour away from my house. We made it work till I got my license (I'm 9 months older). I believe the distance improved our relationship. High school went well together, but he was getting high from weed every single day (which i don't care about anymore since I do). But started molly, cocaine, acid, etc. This was a sporadic issue throughout. Fast forward to senior year. We were in a bit of a situation... I think we were both anxious about college and during spring break we went on a (kind of mutual) "break". I was still very depressed. We hadn't gone a day without talking in years. I hooked up with a few different guys (just kissing) that i knew from my small school. I just wanted to get out, etc after only being with one guy. After 2 weeks, I broke and texted him to meet up. We did. It was dramatic. I told him about 1 of the guys that I saw (couldn't muster up the courage for the rest) and told him we just kissed. He was insanely mad/ jealous. He was always crazy possessive jealous. Also, i told him that his best friend from my school (he hung with him every weekend of high school) and also my 6th grade fling Ryan, had texted me asking to come over and hook up. He went CRAZY. It almost ruined their friendship. About a month after our break, I found a picture of him cuddling with the girl, Aby, on a dark couch. I used to be friends with her they hooked up in 8th grade. When questioned he just insisted that he never did anything with anyone. Even though it was basically evidence right there. I was insane with anger but just put it aside. **Also- there was a girl he worked with whom I loathed. She was known as the town slut. Once when visiting colleges that year I saw some texts she sent to him "Hey sexy man" etc. I never did anything because I was so depressed/ crazy/ jealous/ didn't want to believe it. The break ended up making us stronger. He went to umass amherst in the fall, a party school. And I went to a small private girls school in boston for nursing.. Our first year was perfect. The distance/ recent break made us realize we were inexplicably in love. He drove to me (3 hours) every weekend. He even proposed to me drunk at a party and went ring viewing half heartedly one day. Also, this was the year that his mother's cancer came back. (She was very ill our whole relationship). We visited her at the hospital all the time. I knew things were not going to go well. At the end of freshman year in May, she passed away. My own mother died when I was young, so this was a tough time for both of us. We went home for the summer. Worked at the same restaurant. He decided to go to a community college in the Fall to stay home with Step dad and younger sister (whose father, not John's, abuses her). The year went ok for us. We have always fought a lot. Him not doing enough, etc. Stuff like that. He's always cranky, wants to "chill" and I want to go on dates. He also always burps/ farts infront of me and is just gross. I am health conscious vegan and he eats 5,000 calories of the worst food ever all day every day, which gets to me. We had a great 5 year anniversary very fancy date. Everything was "ok". This summer, my dad moved in with his girlfriend so i had no place to live so moved in with him since i usually stay at his place at home anyways. This is where things went bad. The first 2 months (may and june) were great. Then.. in july he started working 50-60 hours a week at a pizza place and loves it. (i don't get it. he doesn't need that much money at all and I don't work anywhere near that much). I just never see him. THEN, our friend Ryan came home from the army for 2 weeks. Our house was like a party frat house (even his step dad did coke with him and his friends) . One night... we got really drunk (I blacked out) and he had done a ton of adderall and was really drunk too. I woke up in our bed... and all of a sudden our friend Ryan was in our bed with another guy Fred (who also was long time friend from middle/ high school)... Fred started massaging my back playfully. I was naked but he covered me. My bf must have been getting turned on... because he started touching me / trying to fuck with his two friends in the bed.. I was still wicked drunk and went with it. THEN, all of a sudden he's like "suck their dicks" and i was like... what? But... being drunk and everything I hesitated and then did... with kissing/ other stuff... I woke Ryan up and had him join in too. I was so confused. But went with it... Then my bf started saying stuff the whole time (Next time there will be girls, etc...) And I was like No. (I'm jealous AF). but it went on. I had sex with Ryan. It was amazing. Made me realize how terrible sex with my bf was. He was kinda horrified and didn't realize the reason for the orgy with his basically married friends.... but it happened. And my bf watched and then fucked me after they were done. I was ashamed after this. All my friends told me to dump him. I tried breaking up with him 2 times... but was not strong enough. We talked about it a lot, and he said it was just a one time thing and that he didn't want to again..... But like... wtf? I even called a therapist I didn't know for an emergency phone session because I was going so crazy... Does he even love/ care for me anymore? The therapist said she wasn't even sure if he "ever did". I am going off to school in an accelerated nursing grad program and he is going back to umass in the fall. I have clinical on weekend and will see him sparingly. I am moving into an apartment in a crazy party area with my best friend (who hates John). *Also- the girl that he was on the couch with from the incriminating pic from 12th grade posted a photo of him on Instagram at a get together/ going away party for Ryan the army friend. I went ballistic but he said I was over reacting and that nothing ever ever happened. I love him, I really do... but I just don't know. I might just be young and blind... Our relationship hasn't even been good since then. All of his friends/ family say that I'm PERFECT and that he's beyond lucky to have me. Even at parties everyone asks "why are you dating that guy" ...I don't know. Also the drugs (mostly cocaine) have becoming more of an issue and I do know he has some addiction problems. I only do that stuff once in a wile. We have so much history.. do I really need to throw it all away? I don't know.Summary:
Summarize: Hey Reddit! I was just wondering if anyone out there is capable/willing to run a server much like the Mindcrack server, home to the like of Avidya, docm77, and kurtmac. For those of you who are interested, but haven't heard of Mindcrack, it is a private server populated by famous youtubers. the server is entirely survival, but features massive builds such as arenas, a Nether Hub and transport railway, and several large towns. I think a server like this should have been implemented for us in /r/minecraft long ago, and I have been seeking a good community server to hang out on. If it weren't for "technological difficulties" (cheap router--no port forwarding) I would host such a server myself. A second question I have for you is a name. If someone is willing to host, I will set up a subreddit for us to have any further discussions (so as to not clutter up the main Minecraft subreddit).Summary:
Summarize: Extremely important. I was pretty RP as a product of my childhood / college experiences, yet myself and guys like me felt like we were wrong for being what we are. Essentially modern society might produce a RP guy, but it often saddles him with massive guilt for his own "selfishness" or whatnot. People will fundamentally understand concepts like alpha fucks beta bucks, or how marriage is basically a way to railroad men, or how female advice is cancerous to dating success... but they will often wind up feeling like the odd one out, perhaps even insane or morally empty for having the views that they do. The internet helped RP people find other RP people, which led to people in this sphere understanding that to be RP IS natural and normal. If you lived in a different time, it would be the default sexual strategy for males, and even beta males would be more "purple" than blue.Summary:
Summarize: Setting the scene: My high school paid for all the juniors to take the ACT (big ol' fancy test for all you non-americans or americans who don't know tests other than the SAT exist). On the day of testing ONLY the juniors went to school and we got to leave at the end of testing. We had to go through strict security checks, timer marked food/bathroom breaks with no talking, and all our desks were aligned exactly the right distance from each other and taped to mark their spots. You can tell my school didn't want to fuck this up right? Well then there was me. I woke up feeling like SHIT. Like someone beat me and then drenched me in ice water. I felt awful. But I had to go. Since I was dizzy and kind of faint my parents packed me some cookies just in case it was just me having a blood sugar issue. First section goes okay. I keep going from extremely hot to extremely cold but I made it through the section. I retrieve my snacks from the security desk and eat some of the delicious butterscotch cookies. I head back feeling a little better but not a whole lot. Second break rolls around, we have to stay in the room for this one. Our "guardian" says they have to use the restroom so they gathered our booklets and said we could talk quietly until they returned. Everyone gets up and asks me if I feel okay. I do NOT. Final section starts. I am VERY dizzy at this point. I just start filling in answers. I do not care. When we get to the writing section is when the bad thing happens. Five minutes in I get up, completely in autopilot, go to the front of the room, and vomit butterscotch orange disgusting sludge into the trashcan. Next I knew I was being escorted out of the room by two teachers without my glasses, sweater, or anything else I had with me. I had to sit in the office for the rest of the testing time while the principal argued with the official tester about whether or not the group of testers I was part of could get their tests scored because I "ruined" the testing environment. I was crying because I was so sorry. (the tests did end up getting scored, I got a 26 which was the second highest score of my class. Since I got sick and did not finish my school payed for me to take it a second time where I got a 28. I was sick then as well but at least I didn't throw up.)Summary:
Summarize: Look, I get it, most of us get it. This has been a disappointing year in some ways. I personally had the hopes of 7 wins this year with the roster we had. We weren't that far off. I came into this season hoping to be competitive in every game this year and we accomplished that (minus Patriots). If the balls bounce our way or we dont fuck up minor mistakes we could have won the division. Before you guys reply with the excuse that if we had someone like Belichick we would have won 10 games blah blah blah. If Belichick was a coach on every team they would be better. I do agree that I believe there needs to be changes to the defense, with either changing the scheme or coaches. Now all that being said I do believe that next year Gus will be on a very short leash. The roster finally resembles an NFL team and we have the most important piece of the puzzle with Bortles. The team is trending up big time. Signing some free agents, draft, DFJ back I expect this team to be in the 8-10 wins next year. If we are still in this exact same position next year or looking like we are heading there, I will jump on that bandwagon calling for Bradley's head. For now, lets just pump the brakes on every other post calling for him to be fired. It's not going to happen this year and frankly it's getting annoying to read it with every post.Summary:

Summarize: Honestly, just like everything else in the United States, issues that can be addressed with logic and intellect are polarized into wedge issues that separate us from real problems in this country. On one side, you have groups that use dead children as political toys to make changes that don't reflect an actual answer (see the banning of drugs and all the good that has done) and on the other side, you have a massive and I mean massive gun manufacturer lobby and the useless NRA using the same situation to instill fear into large groups of gun owners, which generates these huge surges in gun sales because low intellect Americans actually think a government agent is going to show up at their door with a bag asking for their guns (this is not, and never will happen, despite what your conspiracy theorist uncle says). The result of these highly media fueled sides showing up instead of rational answers, is that the vocal minority on both sides that approach the issue with emotion rather than sense divide everyone on misinformation. Case in point is the idea of universal background checks. I forget the figure, but something like 90 percent of Americans support them, like 75 plus percent of gun owners support them, yet we can't get even that logical step because Democrats can't help trying to attach other shit to the bill and Conservatives can't stop fucking making up lies about the legislation that don't exist but they scream them like they do. Youve got the head of the NRA telling people that a gun bill includes national gun registry (something people wouldn't trust) when the bill literally had the wordage that it would explicitly not have that. I'm a liberal leaning guy that thinks guns are interesting, fun and can teach people about respect and responsibility. There are plenty like me out there but you might not know it when you see how absurdly the US manages to polarize everything.Summary:
Summarize: For what it's worth: I lost 70lbs over 6 months doing keto. I didn't track a damn thing, was lax on the weekends (beer), and straight up spat in the diet's face by occasionally eating ice cream or other indulgences. I had been fat all my life, and even though I was restricting the types of foods I ate it wasn't nearly as stressful as your method sounds. Eat meat, dairy, vegetables, tree nuts, and (some) fruits. Avoid bread, rice, sugary things, etc. Piss on some ketostix until you're in keto, carry on, then check again every once in a while. Power through the plateaus. You'll be fine.Summary:

I blame being a non-drinker in a de facto relationship who isn't living on a college compounded with a complete lack of interest in any of the clubs/societies on campus as well as my personality and niche interests being incompatible with my peers, but it's actually social anxiety reinforced by past failures preventing me from bothering with meaningful friendships.Summary:

Summarize: Posted this on another thread but it is more relevant here Last year, to celebrate the new year, my friends and I went to the beach, a friend has a house there... We have done this a couple of times, but this time was "special" because our friend turned 18... So his parents serve us a little bit of wine, they have a toast and then leave us to eat dinner... Another friend says "tonight will be just like The Hangover....lol jut kidding." Little did we know he was right... We go down to the beach, and get our drink on... Needless to say we all got super hammered. Our friend who turned 18 though was really sad, because he said he wanted to hook up with this girl and then another friend made out with her... So he was shitfaced, and making a fool of himself, so I tell him " hey lets go sit" and he got mad and grabbed a thick ass stick and threw it and it just so happenned to land on my face... Drunken me of course thought he did it all on purpose... So I let him be and storm off pissed as shit... Then, at 6 am we all decide we were going up to the house to get some rest... So we all up gather at the disco but wait... Our just recently turned 18 friend, lets call him Mike, was MIA, he was the one who was sad and angry because another friend hooked up with a girl he wanted to hook up with... Anyways, we all knew of what he was capable of doin drunk... Reckless shit... We searched for about an hour, nowhere to be found. We call his cell, someone picks up, we are all glad cause we think it is him, it is not, he had left his cell back at the house... We all seriously thought he had gone to take a swim drunk as shit in the ocean ( he did this last year, luckily we were all there and able to stop him from getting in ) and he mightt have drowned or something... About and hour later, a friend who had stayed back at the house because he had gotten sick said Mike's dad found him passed out on the balcony... His father did not make a big deal out of it... But we did not want his mother to find out because she would throw a fit... In the end, I was supposed to go back home with Mike because he lived real close to my house, ended going back with another friend to his place which was in no way close to mine, becuase his dad adviced me to becuae his mother was going to question me... Scariest moment of my life....Summary:

The long answer is that when your friendly finance news service reports that Apple is holding $131 Billion in CASH, they are really referring to a line on the balance sheet called Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Securities. Looking at Apple's 2012 [10K Filing]( on page 54 we can see a breakdown of what these are exactly. This statement shows a cash balance of $3 Billion and the rest in a variety of short term, highly liquid investments such as U.S. and non-U.S. government securities, money market accounts, mutual funds, and other corporate securities. None of these investments earn a very robust return; for example, corporate securities earned a fair market gain of $568 million on a balance of $46 Billion, a return of 1.22%, which is not even enough to keep up with current inflation of 2% and CERTAINLY nothing compared with Apple's operating profit margin of 33.46% [source]( So you can understand why people like David Einhorn are very upset, because Apple is just sitting on cash they could use to grow their R&D or manufacturing capacity, or, at the very least, return some of it to the shareholders.Summary:
Summarize: Any girl I try to date. Usually gets on my shit list within a week. They lead me on. Pretend to really like me.(even saying I really like you) When I ask them on a date they just say oh I don't know what I'm doing that day. IF they do say yes they do so excitedly and then stand me up. Its really annoying and hurtful and now I am afraid to ask girls on dates because I'm tired of it.Summary:
Summarize: So, all ye civil and structural engineers, architects, and building officials: the special inspector can act as your eyes in the field. Regardless of whether or not you "trust" us (I have found most do not), we are the subsitute for those contractors' lacking conscience. Granted, I've worked with many special inspectors who aren't worth a shit; though, they're not necessarily disingenuous or not to be trusted, just lazy with a sense of entitlement. Wouldn't it behoove you to try an establish a pretty sold repertoire and degree of trust with someone who plays such a significant role on your project(s)? My best experiences in the industry have been developed through mentoring opportunities with engineers. If an inspector doesn't consider something he's looking at 'important' or know about it, they will most likely overlook it and choose to make no comments in their reports. If they understand why this spec or detail reads this way and not another, you can be certain they will do a better inspection, aka 'observation' (for their DFRs). When an engineer wants to treat the value of my experience as less than their own, I will go above and beyond to prove my worth; however MOST other inspectors will treat your job like shit in retaliation for your disrespect. Long story short, you should trust your special inspectors, they can make or break a project for you and your firm.Summary:
Summarize: A little background story: We were very close friends before we got together. I didn't really like him in that way, but I decided to give us a chance. After a few months, we consummated our relationship. We had a lot of passion during the first few months, and we fell out of the honeymoon phase really quickly. We never really "dated" but just hung around and went out with friends. It's been 4 years and we really care about each other, we really love each other, and we really want to get married in the future. But to be honest, I am really bored. We're both 20 years old and I feel as if we're at that age where we're not old enough to have "adult" fun, but we're too old to have "teenage" fun. And we feel as if we're too young to go on "sophisticated" dinner dates. We both don't make a lot of money, (as a matter of fact, he lost his job almost a year ago severely limiting his ability to act as a boyfriend, which put a lot of stress on me because I felt like I had to be both the boyfriend and girlfriend, if that makes sense), so we can't do anything expensive. And since we're tight with money, I'm very frugal with my gas which makes it harder to go out. We hang out almost every day, and all we really do is eat, sleep, and watch TV. It's hard for us to try to find things we like to do together. He's always asking if I want to try some of his hobbies, like TF2 and League, but I'm just not interested; and I have no hobbies that I could ask him to join into. Most importantly, my sex drive has been really low lately so we don't have sex very often. Because of all this, I feel as if we're no longer a couple. It feels to me that we're just friends that have invested a lot of time into each other and have occasional sex. Is there anything that we can do to spice up our relationship again? Any guides to frugal dating? Is there any way I can try to get my sex drive back to where it was in the beginning? (I'm on birth control pills which can be the cause considering it has a possible side effect of "low sex drive"). Or are there any suggestions to keeping us entertained at home? Here's another thing, which may be an entirely different problem, or it may be related. He was my first and he's been my only. So other than I love him, the fact that we've had sex makes it hard for me to leave him. Sometimes I feel very lucky to have found someone so early in life. But at the same time, is it too soon to settle? A part of me wants to experience actual dating; but the part of me that holds onto the fact he's been my only partner makes it really hard to even consider it. And being bored is making it even more difficult. So I guess my final question is: Reddit, should I salvage our relationship and how? Or should I realize it's time to move on?Summary:
Summarize: I was paid $100 by a bipolar mother to clean her severely mentally ill son's room and clean the viruses from his computer. This kid was messed up, like, when finished eating a bowl of cereal he would just drop it on the floor. Milk and all. We put on gloves and threw away all of his shit, ignoring his protest. I stumbled upon a folder labelled "homework", which was a red flag as he had dropped out of high school. More forboding, the folder was about 115 GB, taking up 70% of his HDD. Upon opening it my jaw just dropped. It was nothing but CP. Not modeling pictures, but vile shit with titles like "6 year old whore Nancy brutally gangraped by daddy.avi". As I scrolled down, it was clear that this mentally ill teen was in possession of most of the child pornography traded in __4__. In a subfolder, there was txt files describing diary entries of how he molested his niece when she was 4, and brutally sadistic fantasies that I am nauseated even thinking about. I wanted to just call the police. He would be tried as an adult and beaten and sexually abused for the rest of his life in a federal pen. I ended up telling his mother what I found, and if she did not send him away and deal with his sexual sadism, and APD + other severe mental issues, I would. I took a screenshot and scrubbed his PC. He became agitated and screamed and cried like a toddler when he was able to get onto his PC when I was done. I've never told anyone this, but that night, we caught him masturbating over my (very buff) friend's cot. We beat him, beat him senseless. I had never been on the giving end of such a brutal beating before but it felt good, good that this monster was feeling even a fraction of what he fantasized about doing to little girls and boys. When he stopped begging for his life (he had urinated on himself and was barely conscious), I went downstairs while my friend (whose daughter was molested) continued kicking and borderline torturing the guy. I told his mother what happened. She apologized, said she was sending him off in the morning, and paid us $140 each. She cried, but she didn't seem upset that we hurt her son. Like she knew what a monster he was and wished we had put him down.Summary:
Summarize: Okay so a few weeks ago I posted on here saying I needed tips making out as I had not done it much before and when I had I had been hammered out of my face. Turns out I was just being a big pussy and it was easier then expected just like every other time. Anyway last thing I posted was asking advice for making out as I was going to a party and thought there was a strong chance of hooking up with this one girl who I thought was hot and we had some connections in the past when drinking and she had showed interest in school the days before the party. Well anyway fast forward to the party and I admittedly got hammered as shit and kind of forgot about the girl I was originally going to go for. I recall saying to my friend "That chick (didnt know her name at that point) is the hottest one here by far and Alex (fake name of another chick from my school that we both knew) is the only one competing"... So the gist of it was I thought this one chick was banggggging. Anyway, this is a pretty big detail here. Earlier that night I was upstairs with my buddy (and this is why im asking you guys to not call me a dick which I am in this case) and we found a pack of smokes in a cupboard. In my drunken state I took them and we went to the garage to smoke. I took a couple rips and gave my friend some cigarettes (I dont smoke other than the odd puff at parties) and he sparked up. The hot chick I was talking about (Ill just call her Jenn from now on) comes into the garage and was asking if one of us had her cigarettes. She sees that my friend was smoking one and asked what kind it was. It was her kind. She starts getting pissed and asking where he got it from. My friend is the worst fucking lying on earth and start changing his excuse and stuff so she pats him down on him front pockets and thankfully ignores me when in reality I had them in my back pocket and I was standing up so she probably wouldve felt them if she searched me. Anyway she had two guys in there who gave her a cocky nod saying theyve got her back so I was ready to tilly but these are all side details that have nothing to do with the post. Point is, I took her cigarettes and she was fiending for them all night. Came in a bit later to garage and friend was smoking another one and she started flipping but at that point I had the cigarettes hidden well in my bag so we were fine. Anyway fast forward back to modern time (at the party) I just said to my friend how hot I thought the chick was and the party goes on whatever just chatting people and drinking etc. Then near the end of the part (like 2:30 or 3:00) I finally meet the chick who I stole the cigarettes from and thought was hot as shit. I was drunk like I said so I had my typical drunk confidence going and sweet talked her for a minute. A different friend of mine comes straight up to me while im talking to this chick and says "Hook up with her" right in front of our faces. Ahahahahahaa. Anyway I go to talk to whoever else and help clean some shit up for the host. Two of my buddies say "Maaan you have to hook up with her" "She wants to hook up with you" and typical shit buddies will say that I take as a joke. This chick is waaaay out of my league. Anyway though I go back to the room where she was and she was on the couch laying down. She asks if I wanted to sleep with her (like literally sleep not bang) and I said yeah Im gonna go help Host out though again for a bit. Anyway I tell my boys whatsup and they tell me I have to hook up with her etc. I was being a big pussy about it though and was like "Naaah we are just gonna sleep" and then they lectured me and said I had to and she wanted me etc. My buddy hands me a condom which I did not think in a million years I would use that night. So fast forward like 10 minutes I go back to the living room where she is and ask if I can still sleep there, to which she replies "yeeeesss". So I hop onto the couch and we just kind of cuddle there for a sec. Host comes into the room and turns the light off and say good night to us, and the other group (one guy and girl on the other couch). We got up for a sec to see if there was anywhere better to sleep in the basement and shit but literally every room was full and the basement was freeeeeezing. So we go back up to the couch. Anyway lights turn off and within 10 seconds she flips over onto me and starts making out. We make out for a bit and shit got more intense (Im guessing I shouldnt go into details here??) but she asks if Im a virgin and I respond I am and laugh and ask if I should bother asking her. Also forgot to mention this earlier she is a year older then me which I figured out in first conversation with her. Anyway I thought she was just asking me about virginity in case or whatever, but I played my cards right. After making out for a while and then (again dont wanna get into too much detail because I feel like a dick saying it here) fingered her and had her shirt off. She states "Oh Id feel so bad" and I ask about what. She says because Im a virgin. And I respond Im not asking you to do anything dont worry. At that point I was happy that I even got to hook up with her and knew I would get crazy props from friends as she was a solid 9.5 with big jugs and ass. Anyway like I said she says she would feel bad but I kept going with her and then she just straight up said I wanna fuck. You get the idea of where it goes from there. Since Im 16 I know you dont wanna know details but anyway I banged her and lost my virginity but was too hammered to stay hard. (HOLY i feel like such a dick writing this here). Anyway thats the update to the story. I went to the party thinking I might hook up with an 8 and ended up banging a 9.5. But the only reason im even posting this is because I have a couple questions. Ill be straight up with you ive been texting her and think it would be sick to hangout with her after school everyday and blaze a bit and bang. I could make this happen easily after talking to her and if I did we would basically be fuck buddies with no strings attached. Now id say im relatively smart and do a lot of reading and everything and will always take any advice when I can get it from anyone who is more experienced/has any advice to give. 1. Is there anything (short of stds) that is wrong/bad about this? And please dont say my age. 2. If she were to figure out about the cigarettes should I just straight up tell her exactly what happened and that I wanted to give them back at that point but it wouldve been too awkward and my chances wouldve been ruined? 3. Do you guys have any other advice I should know before I do this? 4. Any insane heath risks other then STDs at this age because of sex? I mean of course there isnt but still its worth asking. I will take everything into account and if anyone has any crazy point that should change my mind about trying to be FWB they probably will change my mind. I am trying to have fun here obviously but if it isnt the smart thing to do I wont. Thank you for reading and honestly I will probably get downvoted to shit for this one because I came off as such a dick and because of my age. I just wanted to tell the story how it happened. Even if I get one piece of advice I am thankful for that. Since everyone is asking::Summary:
Summarize: I feel bad for all the fools who are still in school at that point! I'll have been done for three weeks!Summary:
Summarize: We were together for 2.5 years when she broke up with me at the end of April. She said she was too busy with school and it was stressing her out trying to have a relationship while working hard on her career. I respected it and although I tried to hold onto her but realized I needed to respect her decision. She says she needs some space but we can be friends. She messages me on my birthday in the middle of June and we talk a little but ends in nothing. We stop talking until the end of July when I message her for her birthday. We talk for a few days and it seems like things are fixing itself and we're both enjoying the conversation. I ask her if she wants to meet up for coffee and she says that she doesn't think it's a good idea because she loves me and she wishes she had time to dedicate to the relationship but it isn't fair to me or her if she keeps on letting me down but she wants to be friends. She thought seeing me would be too hard for her. So I tell her that I can't be friends with her because I'm never going to get over her. We say our goodbyes and I delete her number and block her on fb so I wouldn't see when she likes or comments on something and be tempted to message her. Fast forward to thanksgiving. After not talking to her since July I'm still in love with her and it sucks. I tried my luck with a few girls during this period but no luck. All I want is her. I unblock her on fb to wish her a happy thanksgiving to her and her family and my heart the instant I see her picture. Then I notice that she's still wearing the necklace I gave her and that gives me hope. I send her the message and she responds but I didn't reply because I had this plan where I would try to make her miss me and then message her on Christmas and see where it goes from there. But now as Christmas approaches I don't know if I should. I want her more than anything but I want her to be happy and idk if I should message her. I don't want to live with the regret of not messaging her. I also know she most likely won't message me if I don't because of the type of person she is. Please help. PS: In the show Weeds one of the main character sees a girl he hasn't seen for 8 years that he used to love. He says, "it's been 8 years and I have never loved anyone like I love you." And that hit home for me because that's what I feel like.Summary:

Summarize: When you are on birth control, you don't have normal periods - you have a withdrawal bleed caused by a dip in hormones. Hormones, particularly estrogen, can be stored in fat. So if you have been on birth control, your body has likely stored away excess hormones in your fat cells. Now that you are losing weight, your body is breaking down fat cells and using them for energy, thereby metabolizing the stored hormones and keeping your body from having a noticeable enough drop in hormones to keep you from having a withdrawal bleed.Summary:
Summarize: I had a vegan as a legal guardian for 2 years when I was 15. Biggest fucking bitch this side of the planet. She would always force her bullshit veganism on me. When I had enough of her shit food (she was a shit cook), I decided to get a job to buy the food (read: meat, cheese, eggs) that I wanted. Nope. She would not allow me to store meat or any other non vegan food in the fridge . So I said I would save up and buy a mini-fridge. Also nope. She said if I wanted to eat meat, I would have to find another place to live. That's exactly what I did. I called up my mom and convinced her to take me back. I lived in Alberta at the time, and she flew me all the way back to Québec. I flipped my entire life upside down just to get away from that crazy bitch Best. Decision. Ever.Summary:
Summarize: I was coming home from work one day, very tired, and I exited the freeway and paused at the at the red light at the bottom of the exit ramp with a bunch of other cars. There were 3 lanes and I was in the far right lane waiting to turn right. The middle lane could go left, right or straight. The light turned green. I turned onto the next road where there was also a red light. Right after turning some idiot in a big red truck who was waiting in the left turn lane of Road 1 starting honking his horn, swearing at me and flipping me off. I looked at him confusedly and slowly rolled forward. My light turned green and I drove down Road 1 for a moment and then decided to do a U-Turn and drive back to the intersection. I pulled over and waited for red-truck idiot to turn onto Road 2 and then started following him. Usually I hate any type of conflict. Anyway, red truck idiot notices me following him and pulls over. I pull up next to him, roll down my window and say in a very stern tone of voice "Is there a problem?" He says "Yeah, you almost ran into a lady back at the freeway exit! You veered into her lane when you turned onto the road and she had to slam on her brakes to avoid hitting you!" I hate when people drive like idiots (happens a lot here) and here it was I that had been an oblivious asshole. Flipping me off and cursing me out was probably excessive but I was obviously in the wrong when I veered into her lane (I had probably mistakenly assumed she was turning left. I said "oh, I didn't see her. Well, I guess that was justified, thank you," and I drove off. Sometimes you are affected by the asshole, sometimes you are the asshole.Summary:
Summarize: Jax came into the League as a no name mercenary/assassin. He quickly became a dominant force of the Fields of Justice, so much so that he was limited to not being able to use his favorite weapons. His pool of available choices kept getting smaller and smaller, but his performance was still the bet the League ever had seen and who ever had Jax won, always. One day, he was ready to enter the arena, but was stopped and had his weapon stripped and was given a much more inferior weapon. He became enraged and ripped a light post out of the ground. He screamed angrily that this would be the only weapon he would ever need. He then proceeded to the Field of Justice to kick some more ass.Summary:

Summarize: Hi Everyone, I moved to a larger city by myself a couple of months ago. I have just started to make some friends and I am currently looking for work. I have only been able to secure 1 job interview since moving down here. To help my chances, I joined a recruitment agency and they are actively helping me find work. This is where my predicament begins... I was advised that there is a job I may be suitable for (I have a specific set of skills) and was sent the job criteria, but not their name or address. I agreed to my recruitment agency putting my resume forward to the company and the company have advised my recruitment agency that they would like to interview me. My recruiter has just sent through the details of the hiring company and it is the EXACT same address but on a different level of the 3 story building and they are definitely separate companies. So basically... coincidentally... in the whole of this huge city, I have been matched up with a company in the exact same building, sharing the exact same elevator etc as the place where I had my job interview, but did not get the job. Keep in mind that I did tell my recruitment agency that I applied for a job for x company but did not get it, but I did not tell them about the exact address.I am the kind of person who would feel constantly awkward bumping into the people who did not hire me, say in the elevator or foyer of the small building. My recruitment agency have scheduled for me to see them for a pre job interview briefing tomorrow and I do not know what to do.. Would it be strange for me to call the recruitment agency before the appointment tomorrow and advise that I do not wish to go with this job and explain the reasons, or should I try and make some other excuse, such as it is to far away? (it is about a 30 minute drive from my place)... but then if I say something like that, I limit my potential job opportunities at other places. My recruiter have told me that if I go for this job and do not get it, that they will keep trying to help me find work, so it sounds like this is not my only potential employment. I don't know about how others would feel in this situation? Is it my OCD that is influencing how I feel about this or would other people also feel awkward in the same position? What advice do you have for me? Thank you.Summary:
Summarize: So if you've read my previous posts, you already know the story. For everybody else, here's a quick conclusion: I've met a girl at my university who seems to be quite shy (I myself am aswell) and I asked her out for a date. She agreed and last week we met for a coffee. It was somehow awkward because it was my first date (ever), maybe hers aswell. We somehow got to know each other a little bit, but there were a lot of pauses and we eventually went home because of that (not a good sign, I know). Positive thing was, she already suggested me a good time for this week where we could meet. However, today I met her again and conversation-wise it went pretty good. She only had 1.5 hours time, and we managed to talk all the time without any pauses. It felt like I could have asked her questions for at least another hour of conversation when she had to go. (Just for understanding, we went for a simple walk because it was sunny) The only problem I currently have is that there has been no physical contact AT ALL by now. Neighter me touching her arm nor a welcome hug. It really bothers me because I think it really keeps a lot of distance between us. I am not saying that I expected to kiss her today, but not even touching her once in any way is a bit harsh. I know that a reason (probably the biggest one) for that might be me being too careful / over politely. I am not sure though how I can overcome this barrier as she seems so far away from me and just hugging her for goodbye somehow seems wrong. She seems to have interest though, as we already cleared a date for next week. Does anybody have any help or a method how I can overcome the distance (which is feelable in our conversations)? Thanks a lot.Summary:
Summarize: Today....it was great. I realized that starting off fresh with a sorc wasn't going to cut it. I had to take it the good ole fashion way. Necro summoner. BoonDocks. That was his name. He still lives. He's in his 50's and currently going strong. But it's not because of that, that he will be remembered. It is his journey that he will be remembered for. The journey that started with a 2 complete strangers doing tombs, and when BoonDocks joined it became a 3 man game. Note that at this point BoonDocks had not passed act 2 and thus realized he could party with these tombers and potentially finish act 2. Little did you know, another fellow joined and came along, another necromancer. Now making it a 4 man trade. We realized that our name was deceiving after shortly beating Duriel, so we remade our game and called it Act3 start or something along those lines. And there, a great journey began. More and more people joined. We joined forces. We lived memories. We lived our childhood dreams once more. We were in an 8 man party going from Act 3 onwards to Act 5 in Nightmare mode. We had three necromancers full of skeletons and summons, while we had a brave sorceress teleport on HER OWN WILL to the several new places in nightmare mode. I can't forget to mention we had an assassin who sat with her traps (note she said she did no damage, but looked like she did tons of damage), then we had a paladin who's skills and stats were totally wrong, and last but not least we had two remaining sorceress dishing out their meteors and their frozen orbs. You could not believe the lag this 8 man team made. It was like back in the day when everyone hated necro summoners. We lived memories. We lived strong. And we remembered the good times. Cheers to you all. Thank you for spending the day with me. You will forever be remembered.Summary:
Summarize: If you just want to fuck her then ask her out and do it. Assuming your friend isn't fucking with you it shouldn't be that hard. If you want to date her, get the scoop on her boyfriend. This probably won't be a zero sum game where she either stays with her boyfriend or leaves him for you. If you like her be prepared to deal with a metric shit ton of drama and horseshit. It might be different if he were in town, but a lot of times guys don't realize that girls like to hook up just like we do.Summary:
Summarize: As a lactose intolerant person, I want the bandwagon to roll into anti-lactoseville. Then I will get way more lactose free products. Not fucking soy, not bitch-ass almonds and not motherfucking coconut. I want cow's milk with the fucking lactose removed. There is currently a limited selection but I'm hoping that eventually the bandwagon will come my way and the market will explode giving me delicious dairy treats that don't make my digestive system turn against me.Summary:
Summarize: Hopefully this doesn't get too long since I usually ramble on lol* I'm 33, born male. Had anxiety/depression/body image issues since puberty. Finally realized this past few months I'm trans and everything suddenly makes sense and my panic attacks stopped and I'm feeling more social and happy even when presenting male. Also quit drinking finally. Wanted to see a therapist for years for those issues and alcoholism but the anxiety preventing me. Now however I had my first therapy session yesterday and have another on Monday with the same therapist and have another therapist scheduled next Saturday to see which I like better. This is too important for me to let my anxiety prevent me from transitioning! Ok that's a quick background. Now all this has made me also think about my sexuality, although technically I've always been thinking about this but now that hopefully I can start exploring my sexually now that I feel comfortable with myself and my body (or will once I'm transitioning). By definition I know I'm bi since sexually I'm attracted to men and woman. I want to have sex with women (haven't yet), but also want to give oral to a guy and receive anal (I do enjoy using toys). Also unrelated to that I now I realize why I also usually identify with the female in porn I watch lol Anyway sexually I like everything. However physically and emotionally I'm only attracted to women (cis/trans). My porn preferences were usually lesbian or transgender porn. I sometimes did watch gay porn but they had to be really feminine and twinkish and it had to be really sexual. If they talked a lot or it was more about making out it did nothing for me so I usually just stuck with lesbian/trans porn. I'm speaking in past tense since lately I haven't watched any and haven't been horny (not on hormones yet but just lost interest). Now my sexual history: Like I said, never had sex with a woman. Did however experiment with a male friend during my teens. We met when I was 8 and he was 7 when we became neighbors and we became best friends. A couple years later probably around age 10 or 11 we'd occasionally show each other our genitals when playing in the woods and sometimes touch them together. Nothing out of the ordinary for kids and I also remember doing similar things with other friends when I was real young (~5). When puberty hit and we both started masturbating I started getting porn on my PC. I had my own PC in my room and he had a shared family PC so he couldn't get any so he'd come over and I'd show him some. He'd then go use my bathroom to masturbate. Shortly after one of us (probably me I'm guessing lol) suggested I help and give him oral while he watched, so I did. He'd say when he was ready to cum and I'd stop and he'd finish in a tissue. After that I then asked in return for what I did could I get on top? So I'd do that and then pull out when ready and finish in a tissue. At the time my family was religious as was I (in so much as I believed not that I actually really did religious things) and I thought being gay was wrong and I'd get HIV just from doing this. So I always felt super ashamed after, especially because I didn't feel gay since I wasn't attracted to him at all it was just sexual so I couldn't figure out why I couldn't stop. This continued for my entire teenage years until I turned 18. I stopped at 18 for two reasons. One he would've still been 17 so I was worried about age of consent stuff. And 2 was my shame issues. I convinced myself it was just dumb teen experimentation but if it continued as an adult it meant I was gay and that would be the worst thing ever I thought at the time :/ Now I'm atheist and open so I no longer regret what I did. In fact I do have regrets but only that it didn't go further. I never helped him to completion now I wish I had and he never tried to penetrate me and I wish I had let him try. Also I wish I had penetrated him but since I was overweight and below average I never actually penetrated when I'd go on top. That was my last and only experience with sex. So I'm not sure if me wanting to give oral and receive anal now is maybe just a nostalgia thing lol? Also any chance, even though what I did doesn't bother me anymore that somehow deep inside the religion/shame issues are clouding me so all I see is the sexual attraction but maybe I could eventually be physically/emotionally attracted to men as well as women? I'm wondering this because part of me wishes I was so my choices would expand greatly and now with the transitioning thing I'm sure I'll get more attention from men since even as male I'd get hit on by guys a lot but have to tell them I'm straight. Now I'd have to tell them I'm a lesbian but if I could tell them I'm bi and mean it it would open up a lot of things for me. I suppose things may become clearer when I get on HRT since I've read others who have similar feelings (attracted only to females or attracted to females but still sexually like it all) and once on HRT realized they liked both or even started preferring men. I realize my hormones won't change my sexual preference but it may help me realize what was already there but I was suppressing. Also I realize I have a fear of men which makes sense now but I always felt different than them and intimidated by them which now I realize is because I was trying (and failing miserably at lol) being one of them when I wasn't. Maybe once this fear goes away it'll allow me to be attracted to them completely. *Ok sorry see I rambled! lolSummary:
Summarize: Any suggestions for a pale girl wanting to highlight? I'm typically the lightest shade, or maybe second lightest shade, of foundation. I have been using Laura Gellars duo higher, but ran out of the pale matte side about 3x faster than the shimmer.Summary:
Summarize: Holy shit what a day. I'm pretty fuckin' stoned right now so forgie any typos. Also, I can't for the life of me organize a story at this time of day. So enjoy? Anywhey, so I'm havin a good ol' sesh on the back porch with my buddy. It's dark outside, music is playing.. casual. Suddenly it sounds like a monster truck is coming down the neighborhood. Stops near the house, I hear a quick acceleration and he's gone. My car alarm got set off, assuming it was his loud ass exhaust that set it off, I quickly turn off my alarm and resume the sesh. 10 minutes later we're heading to get some food and come to find the trashcan and all of its contents spilled on the driveway. There's clear trashcan skid-marks heading to my car. Sure enough, I look at my car.. there's a big ass dent. BUT THAT'S NOT THE WORST PART. The trashcan just fucking missed my plastic bumper and nailed the metal. Trashcan went bottom first, the hardest part of the trashcan just so happened to nail my car. Here's the fun part, I listen for this fuckers exhaust (it seriously sounds exactly like a damn monster truck). I hear him in the streets and my buddy and I get in my car and head to the noise. Stopping occasionally to see where he's moving to. We're driving and I noticed the image I pictured this vehicle looking like waaaaaaay far down the streets, flip a bitch and fly down the neighborhood (really late, general public asleep, I was pissed) and find this huge lifted bronco style decked out with KC lights, a tire rack on the roof, the whole package) He's parked in the middle of a culdesac with his lights off. He turns his lights on when he sees me coming and bolts it in a different direction, I'm chasing his ass while calling 911. This truck was hauling ass, I realized I was driving super reckless so I gave up. I didn't get plate so they got away. I filed a report on the damage but I highly doubt anything will happen. Fucking bull shit.Summary:
Summarize: You should learn to "adjust gears" - it's basically a requirement of long term training anyway. If you're going balls to the wall every time, that's your issue. I (a featherweight male) was training with a newbie yesterday who had 30 lbs on me, and he was blown away, claiming "You're so strong!". I was going ~10%, simply feeding him the responses so he and I could work on what we learned in class. With your attitude, I would've smashed the shit out of him, and he wouldn't have learned a thing. Instead, he got to work the two things he knew, and I got to work my escapes.Summary:
Summarize: Mom and best friend (only friend at the time) were planning a surprise party. At some point I over heard a conversation, but didn't ever say anything shot finding out because I didn't want to be a killjoy. On goes time and my birthday happens. I'm sitting at home playing video games. It was oddly late. Maybe she was coming home from work? So a few hours pass by. I'm off to sleep and my mom comes home, loud. Bursts into my room. "hey! name do you want to go to dinner for your birthday?" So, free food? Fuck yeah. What 14 year old wouldn't want to go get dinner? "Sure mom!" So we go. This is the night they have been planning for a while to throw a surprise party that I "know nothing about." While we're driving, my mom asks me if I want to invite any friends. Sure. Let me call my best friend who I rarely hang out with, who rarely has time to hang out. "Hey!" - "yes I'll hang out with you" odd, he's always busy. Skip to dinner. Me, moms, best friend, and brother at applebeas. During an awkward quiet moment, my mom breaks the silence by saying "so, we originally had a party for you planned..." (Okay. I know this, but you dont know that I know this. *shows mild surprise face*) brother tries to shush me mom. Nope. Mom continues, "it was going to be a surprise party. We invited like 45 people from your school." Brother interjects " my name , eat your shit (food), mom. Shut up" my best friend was trying to get my mom to be quiet. I'm just curious what the fuss is. I'm just wanting to hurry up with dinner so we can go to my not-surprise surprise party. Mom continues, not paying thought to best friend and brother, "we tried convincing everyone to come. The band never showed up, and nobody else from school showed up either. Even that country kid you've been friends with sense first grade. He didn't show up. So we had to cancel it and, now we're here."Summary:
Summarize: Just turned 30. Texting was around during my dating days, but not a prevalent. I agree with all of the above. Also, chances are that she's given her number to people before, if most guys these days are texting, then you'll stand out as the guy that called. You'll be unique, bold, it's worth major points.Summary:
Summarize: Not really a mistake. In the past year, she laid off 19 teachers, but gave herself a 5% raise. She makes in the upper 25% for superintendents in the state! even though there are many much larger schools. She usually doesn't call late starts until 7:00, even though early bird starts at 6:30 and normal school starts at 7:45. She doesn't feel the need to come in on days when it is this cold because she "has a longer drive."Summary:
Summarize: They won't turn you in That's right, and that's wrong. If you tell them about your urges, and how you feel, they cannot reveal that to anyone you don't give explicit permission to. HOWEVER! If you say something, and they think you may be a danger to yourself, or anybody else, they are obligated to report that to the police, along with any relevant information they may need. (Note: Check your local ethics code that psychiatrists follow, and any mandatory reporting laws. They shouldn't be able to report something that happened in the past, but that is all up to the area you live in) I know this, as when I was younger, my mom went on a trip, and I had the place to myself for a week. Before she went to the airport, she dropped my off at my therapist. My therapist said something that triggered memories of severe abuse from my father. Usually, I just break down and cry during those times. But the therapist kept pushing and pushing despite the fact I said I wasn't ready to confront those memories. She kept pushing and pushing. Eventually, I just went numb. I felt no emotion, I felt like I had nothing to lose. I just stood up, walked to the door, opened it, turned towards the psychiatrist and said "Don't worry, after this weekend my father will no longer be an issue in my life, or anyone elses". I left, and caught the bus to go home to get a weapon, and kill him. That was fully my intention, as at the time, I was apathetic to the consequences of my actions. I felt that by killing him, I would save another helpless child from being abused the way I was. However, the bus ride home was pretty long. Just over an hour. During the time away from the psychiatrist, I started to regain my emotions. Regain my sense of self, and how no matter how evil my father was, I couldn't stoop to his level. I got off at the last bus stop, which is usually where I would get off to go home. Instead of walking home, I walked 2 minutes in the opposite direction, and went to the RCMP station. I intended to finally, after many years, have my father charged with the abuse throughout the years. I was in an "interrogation" room for over an hour, answering questions. The officer excused himself, got up and left for a moment to check on something. He came back 20 minutes later with 3 officers, and they strip searched me to ensure I had no weapons, and put me in handcuffs, and took me to a youth mental health ward for an overnight examination (I was released the following morning). Never once did they ask if I wanted to continue with pressing charges. They ignored the fact that I did the responsible thing and went to an RCMP station to do what needed to be done to get closure instead of being violent and ending my fathers life. All they cared about was that the municipal police had issued a notice to urgently bring me in to the mental health ward for examination. To me, it felt like they didn't care about me, or what I went through. I tried twice after that throughout the years to press charges against my father. The first time, the RCMP told me that I could only press charges in the province in which it started , despite it occurring throughout several provinces (5 to be exact). The second time, I contacted a legal advise line run by the provincial government. I explained why I wanted to press charges, and possibly get help as it was a sensitive issue. The cunt on the other end of the line told me to suck it up, and being abused as a male wasn't half as bad as being abused by a female. I said some things after that to her on the phone that, if I said it to anyone else I would feel ashamed. But to her? No. She belittled the abuse I went through, and made me feel worthless, all because I wasn't an abused female. I was in a mental health "clubhouse" at the time (Laing House in Halifax), and a few case workers had to pry the phone away from me and forcibly drag me into another room to calm me down. They didn't call the police, and for that, i'm grateful. Now, before any of you start bashing police in response to me, please. Don't. I lost respect for the officers that I spoke with in regards to the abuse. I still have, and will continue to have, tremendous respect for the RCMP, and other provincial and municipal police. I'm not going to hold the actions of a few against the whole. edit:Summary:
Summarize: So luckily for you all, this fuck up happened on this day and doesn't involve sexy times with anyone. Just me being a general dumbass. So me and some friends decided to get some food before our next class we all had together at 1:15 so at about 12:45-ish we all piled into each other's cars and went to the nearest Taco Bell. I fucking love those cinnabon bites you can get there now... I think they're going to kill me one day but that's besides the point. I planned on sharing these nuggets of delicious, sugary goodness with my friends and they're only available in 2, 4, or 12, so basically a sample, a snack, or diabetes as your choices, but that's besides the point. Anyways, I'm getting a dozen to let my friends have some. We're inside Taco Bell, not the drive thru, because the car line looked rather long and it's fucking cold out so we all go inside. I go up first, my order is easy, just a 12 pack of cinnabon bites. This is where I fuck up. I look right at the lady and ask for a 12 pack (Taco Bell enthusiasts may know where this is going already) without missing a beat. I'm ready to get my little personal serving of 'Merica in a plastic cup and don't really think anything when the cashier asks me 'crunchy or soft?' Now I've ordered these bites in 12's before and really should've realized that was a weird question to ask for fried dough, but no, I'm a fucking retard and say, "wow didn't know you could do that... um, how bout soft?" so she rings me up, hands me the receipt and my card (important) and it says 12 fucking dollars on there. Um, they cost 4.50? So it's at this point I realize... oh shit, I just ordered one dozen soft tacos instead. Now this isn't a big deal, just take the tacos? But nah, I want my cinnabon bites and I'm determined to have my friends experience the foodgasm these will create upon touching our tongue. So as politely as I can (I work as a concessionist as my job so I try to be polite and not a hassle like some customers can be) I explain I've really screwed up on my order and it's my fault entirely. Could you give me a refund for this, I meant the cinnabon bites but didn't make that clear enough (because I'm a goddamn moron mind you). You'd think that'd be it but nope, it can't be that simple. This IS a fuck up after all, not just a minor mishap. So the cashier looks a bit befuddled and worried at once. She tells her manager, a shorter, stockier, younger woman complete with obviously fake colored hair and a massive attitude, she needs a refund. The manager looks like she's going to jump across the counter and fucking kill me. Now without looking directly at me, because that'd of course be way too rude and direct, she starts talking VERY loudly about how inconsiderate this is and how there's people waiting (I felt bad enough for keeping my friends and the assorted strangers waiting) but really was taken aback she was making this huge a deal out of this. A refund right? Well I paid with a card. And this manager doesn't know how to refund a card payment. And as far as I could tell only one of their registers was open so I'm holding up the whole line. (opening up another one isn't that easy, again concession experience) I feel so stupid now, but at the same time, I really couldn't help but wonder how you can earn the title of manager but not perform a card refund? My place of work, all managers and even some regular cashiers can perform refunds for customers. This manager had to call someone higher up, maybe customer service, shit I don't know, to tutorial her on how to do this refund. Meanwhile she's yelling to the back, do NOT make that dozen tacos, ay throw in a dozen cinnabons, while I'm standing off to the side letting other people get their orders out of the way. I feel like a really dumb shit, my friends think this whole ordeal is priceless, and I mean I'm not socially anxious, this is pretty funny, but I still felt bad for holding up the line. I overheard an older guy wondering why this woman couldn't just do the refund and made a public point of me being a detriment to the establishment or something but after quite a few more minutes, she rings up the refund, gets me some cinnabon bites and a reciept, all while looking super duper flustered. I don't think I've ever seen a human being so pissed off over dumbassery, it was just a mistake, allbeit a really stupid one. I felt a bit selfish for not just taking the tacos really but I work minimum wage and really didn't want to spend 12$ on food I didn't want and figured a refund would be a reasonable request. At the end of the ordeal, we were two minutes late for class (after intense reckless teenage driving) but I had the bites, the cinnamon sugar sprinkled food of the gods, and I was content.Summary:
Summarize: My girlfriend left facebook logged in on my computer. We recently broke up and got back together, with the single period lasting for 2 weeks. I thought it would be funny to send her a message to herself reminding her to log out next time, when I saw that she recently messaged her ex. He has been constantly bothering her, so I wanted to know if he said something that was threatening to her. I accidentally went too far back, and I saw several pictures of them fucking and walls of erotic text, and recently she talked to him about "breaking up with the poor kid." They then talked about his dick, and the conversation dropped. We got back together 3 days after this conversation, when she told me she didn't even think about getting with other guys. I threw up and I can't stop obsessing over it. What the hell do I do?Summary:
Summarize: then you have csgo casual public servers where there's literally girls who have profile biographies of "yes i am a girl gamer - no i will not have sex with you!" and shit like that i purposely fucking talk shit and figure out what position they play on the other team every round to kill them to make them fucking leave all they do is flock these fucking loser neckbeards who have maymay names and are non-stop mic spamming commentating losers to their rescue whenever anyone shittalks them even without any gender discriminationSummary:
Summarize: I'm 41, female, and in a shitty situation. So many bad choices, ugh. Anyway, I'm a vet on a disability pension and stuck living next to a viciously hostile neighbor. I have no car currently and stuck in a college town. I need to get away from this asshole but cant afford a car AND a new apartment. im now terrified of trying to find a roommate. I have two teenage kids that visit me every other weekend. I have an ex husband who is pretty mean. I have MS and really bad PTSD. I feel old and isolated and very very lonely. I feel like I cant trust my judgment. I have to live on $1380/month, and am very lucky in that regard, but fuck...I feel paralyzed by stress and just need advice. Or something. This is theSummary:
Summarize: Facepalm > a) Stop worrying about, pressuring for, or talking about an 'official' label or title. This chick is your girlfriend. b) The reason she wants to have sex with you is not so she can kill herself. You are both being dramatic. c) Don't plan the sex. The weather is awesome. Take her swimming or exploring in the woods or something FUN. Spend the afternoon together. Get a bottle of wine later on. When you are both feeling it, whether in the woods or later that night or whenever, put your penis in this woman . Do not stop for some dramatic, depressing conversation about suicide. Don't even think about her killing herself. In fact, just think about how fucking awesome life is and she'll follow your lead.Summary:
Summarize: Ok imma be honest with you. I genuinely don't really give a fuck anymore. I support gays for whatever the hell they want to do, I don't really care. I also don't give a flying fuck if they get upset over a damn word that isn't even targeted towards them in any way shape or form. Its like when someone calls a black guy a nigger and the white dude next to the black guy gets more offended than the black guy. Lastly, I don't give a fuck if other people don't support them. I won't bitch and complain like you and the 7 or 8 other maddys are doing to me. They have a reason for hating gays that 90% of the time will not be able to be wavered so why even bother?Summary:
Summarize: Okay, the guy probably shouldn't have asked about the cancer, but only because it wouldn't be funny. In any other situation, if someone said "I have cancer" it would be completely appropriate to ask for more details. And if your waiter brought it up, it would be impossible not to ask about it. What kind of waiter brings up their cancer without a decent reason? Also, opera houses are absolutely notorious for the amount of cheering and booing the audience does during the performance. I heard once that the Metropolitan Opera House had such a booing problem in the 90s that they put a note in the program telling people not to boo so that the singers could get through the performance.Summary:
Summarize: Ima a little late, so this'll probably get buried. I grew up in one of the nicer suburbs in my city, not quite top tier, but it's where all the rich private schools are, so close enough. Anyway, go back 20years, and just around the corner there was this guy who had a tree cutting business, just a Ute & trailer deal, not very big at all. Then the Ute became a Truck parked in the street, then two, his house became the biggest most opulent in the street, neighbours complained about him parking the trucks on the street, so he bought their property, developed into a mansion and uses the front for parking those trucks. He has steadily bought every house in that street, turned them into mansions and either resold, or rents them out. It's gone from the cheap street in the good suburb to a line of fricking mansions, and every bit of it was paid for with manual labour.Summary:
Summarize: Extremely important. I was pretty RP as a product of my childhood / college experiences, yet myself and guys like me felt like we were wrong for being what we are. Essentially modern society might produce a RP guy, but it often saddles him with massive guilt for his own "selfishness" or whatnot. People will fundamentally understand concepts like alpha fucks beta bucks, or how marriage is basically a way to railroad men, or how female advice is cancerous to dating success... but they will often wind up feeling like the odd one out, perhaps even insane or morally empty for having the views that they do. The internet helped RP people find other RP people, which led to people in this sphere understanding that to be RP IS natural and normal. If you lived in a different time, it would be the default sexual strategy for males, and even beta males would be more "purple" than blue.Summary:
Summarize: I didn't think it was a waste of money. I don't agree with everything in his book, but I think it's decent. I'm running the program right now, or did day 1 at least. I'm a full time student so I don't have 2-3 hours to spend in the gym. I need to go in, do shit, and get out. I used to spend 2-3 hours cause my volume was so high (pro- I developed high work capacity and can handle a ton of volume and still recover) so this program was different. I got in, lifted, got out in under 50 mins. I'd say if you don't want to look like a bottom heavy person, e.g. those coming off of SS, then pick this up. It's a nice change of pace. I'm modifying the program by adding more sets and reps, as well as some more accessory work (bodybuilder type stuff).Summary:
Summarize: Hey, guys Sorry for all the information I'm about to give you. I just really want some help from people who know all the facts. I am 21f and my boyfriend is 22m. We go to the same college, and have been dating for over a year, and we live together. When we first started dating, we had sex a lot. It seems like everyday that we hung out ended in sex. It was awesome. Things started to slow down a little bit a few months ago. When we started living together... He is a Christian dude, except not very extreme. He turned to religion when his mom passed away last year. He was "saved" at a church camp he chaperoned over last summer, and is truly believing and passionate about God. He used to sometimes cry and say he wished I would just be "saved." I've told him that I feel silly about it and that I'm just not ready for it. So he has put it behind. I go to church with him and never try to disrespect what he believes and we are both okay with that. Except when it comes to sex. I am on birth control. It has been 2 years since I had an implanon put in. I never get a period. At first my sex drive was extremely decreased. I went a year without sex and was completely okay. But now my sex drive is through the roof. I constantly think about sex and am always horny and ready to go! Me and my boyfriend have great sex and I love it. The only problem is now that he won't have sex with me. The first month we lived together, our sex was normal as ever. It was everyday and sometimes twice a day. Now it is once every two weeks if I am lucky. Every time I try to prompt sex with him, he says that we do it too much and he is "straying from the lord." He will keep saying this until he reaches the brink of his horniness I guess. Then he'll have me give him a super quick blow job, but no sex usually. And that makes me all the more horny. But he never messes around with me or anything. I feel like he looks down on me for being so weak/horny. I have to beg and beg for him to have sex with me, but he will never give in until he wants it. And I can't deny him when he wants it, because I already want it so bad. He says all I care about in our relationship is sex, but it's not true. It just builds up inside and it's all I can think about. I feel like a horny man or something. Like other girls aren't like this. He says the devil is tempting me and I need to speak with God. I don't agree. He will have a HUGE boner that I can feel whenever I'm trying to seduce him, but he will still say no to me! I don't get it. Why is it so hard for him to do? :/ I also find that I masturbate way too much. It can be from at least 3 to 10 times a day. :( It doesn't even calm down my sex drive. At all. I just keep going and going. After sex though, I feel relieved and 'finished.' I can achieve an orgasm through masturbation, but I never feel finished, and can go right back to masturbating a minute later. I'm so embarrassed about it, and he doesn't even know I do it. He doesn't masturbate, (unless he somehow does it at work) because I am with him all the time at home. We shower together, sleep in the same bed, and everything. He will have a boner in the shower and won't let me anywhere near it. I just don't get it at all. Am I pushing him? I feel like if genders were reversed here, it would be really bad. I just don't know how to calm myself down. What should I do??? Other than our sex life, our relationship is amazing. He is everything I ever wanted, and I love him with all my heart. He makes me soooo happy, and I definitely do not want to end things with him over this. He doesn't want to get married until he has finished college and has a steady job. He wants to have a huge church wedding or something and be financially stable. That could be 4+ years before anything like that happens. I've suggested no sex at all until then if it makes him uncomfortable and he said "WHAT! No? I just mean we need to slow down. Not stop." But he doesn't realize that I'm not getting anything. So if this all has to be slow "until marriage" is it going to get worse? How should I talk to him? It's very embarrassing to me, because I'm very shy, especially about sex. So I don't know how to approach this. Especially when he gets all Christian on me. Side note - If it is my birth control that has driven me to being a nymphomaniac, it won't be another year until it is removed. But I'm not sure if it is the cause or not. If so does anyone know a way to counter it or decrease my sex drive?Summary:
Summarize: Hey there everyone :) My name is Maeve, I'm 17 and MTF. For the past 11 years, I've known I was trans, and the feelings have only grown stronger and stronger. I still live with my parents, but I'm getting to that point of suppressing my emotions that I'm starting to feel like I can't keep on living like this. My mom won't allow anything of any kind until I'm done with college in 4 years [including name changes, clothing, hormones, the whole bit] I just dont know what to do anymore. I've talked with her countless times but she just won't listen. Any and all advice would mean the world. Thank youSummary:
Summarize: Freshman year- My Gf and I had been out most if the night at a friends apartment making weed butter and then a bunch of edibles. Between all the butter that had gotten on us while we cooked and all the edibles we ate we are both sky high. We get back to my on campus apartment, nobody's home. My three roommates all stumble in loudly about 30 mins later drunk as hell, they had been a some party. We are sharing the stories of our nights when we suddenly hear a shriek from outside. We are all fucked up so none of us really react until we hear a girl running down our hall screaming "help help!" Me and my four roommates all rush outside, my gf and a couple other girls stay behind in the room. We get in the hall and this panicked girl is just sayin"upstairs upstairs please you guys have to do help!" We are all way too fucked up to know what to do so we all just bolt for the stairs and run up to the third floor. We throw open the door to the hall to just see the walls covered in blood. Like fucking everywhere in HUGE streaks across the walls and big semi-soaked in puddles on the carpet. Despite being high as shit I am the most sober one of the four of us so i took the lead and ran towards this writhing body on the ground, then notice there is a girl crying hysterically nearbye and some shirtless dude holding her. This kid we all knew is just in a heap on the floor, he has this massive gash on his head that is just hemorrhaging blood and there is this huge rock like two feet to his left covered in blood. So I grab the kid and using what training I can remember while I'm so fucked up my roommates and I try to to talk to him and carefully rolled him onto his back. Although the whole time he keeps trying to sit up and grab at the rock while making this just like guttural moan. " Jack (not his real name) what's going on?" "Unnnnnggggg" "Jack come on dude speak to me what the fuck happened." "Unnnnngggggg" roommates:"Steve what do we do?!?" "Shit, well if he can't communicate we don't have a choice call 911" (bear in mind we all liked this kid and new that if we called the paramedics and cops this would be it for him at school) roommates look at me hesitantly but say" alright FUCK" So roommate A runs off to call for help while B,C, and I try to piece together what's happening while stopping the blood from gushing out of jacks head. Shirtless dude" we were watching a movie and suddenly we hear a knock on the door, Girl went to answer it and as soon as she opened the door this crazy fucker just decked her in the face!" Although he didn't elaborate more we were never sure how much of the damage on jacks body was dealt by shirtless guy but I have no doubt it was more than a little. While he is telling this to roommate C I am looking jack over and that's when I look in his eyes to see they were dark red and had pupils the size of dimes" FUCKING SHIT! He's high out of his god damned mind!" Turns out elsewhere on campus earlier that night jack had eaten several candies laced with LSD and was tripping his balls off. So anyway at around that point two cops, one of which I had a bit of a history with suddenly burst into the hallway guns drawn. We all throw our hands up as we are being aimed at and so jacks head starts gushing more blood. "What the fuck is going on?!" Dick cop yells "Don't shoot! We found him like this, he needs attention now! Also I think he's on drugs because he is completely nonresponsive, and keeps trying to hit himself with that rock!" I shouted gesturing to the big bloody stone. The cops thankfully lowered their guns and holstered them but then dick cop pulls out his taser and starts threatening jack with it ordering him to get down and comply or be tased. Roommates B,C,and Start yelling" No STOP! He doesn't understand what your saying let us just hold him down he's fine he just needs medical attention!" "Back away from him NOW!" So we all stood up, pretty well covered in blood, and did as he said. Jack pulled himself towards the wall and leaned against it but roommate B grabbed the rock and moved it away from Jack, who still kept reaching for it and the cop kept threatening to taze him if he kept moving, not that jack understood. Eventually the paramedics arrived and carted away Jack, and treat the girl who got a huge black eye. Never heard from jack again personally but B did and he said that according to Jack he had no recollection of how he wound up in our building or why he punched the Girl, but that he kept hitting himself with the rock because he saw it as his brain and was scared if he didn't get it back into his head he would die. So ya that was the craziest thing I saw in college although I do have some other good stories as well. Always remember kids, drugs can be fun, but they can also be very very VERY dangerous. Edit: To everyone who has a problem with how I wrote it, I hope it did piss you off and that you didn't read it. People like you deserve it and I'm not going to change it. If you expect well written and properly edited stories, read a book not reddit. For all of you too lazy/requested it:Summary:
Summarize: About two months ago I drove from Flagstaff to Phoenix, with my friends D and N, to go to a rave (Rainbow Brite 2) We have plenty of money (for broke ass people), a new sack of dank buds, an old sack of perfectly cured dank buds (PERFECT!!!) and the next forty-eight hours to party like we mean it. We cruse down the road blasting tunes and rocking out. We smoke bowls (should we pack #1 or #2 dude?) and eat snacks. We bought a bunch of string cheese, snack bars, juice and other awesome munchies. We get to the party and during the securing of the car and stashing our valuables I can't find my wallet. I figure I won't stress it because I still have all my money and I can find my wallet latter. When we get to the security guy we won't let us in because I don't have I.D. to prove I am not 16 (I am 21 and most people think I am quite a it older) and my friend D does not have any I.D. either so we can't get in. We dejectedly walk back to the car feeling really let down. We get back to the car and drive off into the city and start calling everyone we know in Phoenix because we still want to party and have allot of money and weeds. We are smoking and driving and I decide to pull off the road so I won't be driving all erratic while I look up numbers. As we are sitting of the side of the road I see a big white pedo-van pull out of the ally behind us and as it turns I see the rack of sirens. They are obviously going to come investigate us so I decide if I drive away (in a reasonable manner) I have a slightly better chance of them not investigating us. I have a warm pipe with a half smoked bowl sitting in my lap so I put it in my pocket because I know I can't hide it anywhere in my car this quick. After following us for a few blocks they flip on their sirens right before I pull out onto a major street (why do they always pull you over in really shitty spots) and two cops hop out. A female cop comes up to my window and asks for my papers. I tell her I don't have my license but I give her my registration and insurance though. A male cop walks up to the passenger window and says "I smell weed in the car" and pulls N out of the front seat and sits him on the curb and pulls D out of the back seat (my cars a two door) as I am giving the female cop my info he says "Get her out of the car it smells like weed" referring to me. I am a man but I have long hair and he only saw me from behind, it happens sometimes. Despite the fact that I was going to jail I thought that was kind of funny. The female cop then pulls me out of the car and handcuffs me, pats me down, she feels the pipe and ask if she can get stuff out of my pockets I tell her no (can't search me without a warrant bitches) so she sits me on the curb and goes and has a brief conversation with her partner than climbs into their van starts running all our info (remember two of us have no ID on us). The guy cop is grilling my friends and one of them ( I think D) tells the cop that yes we were smoking in the car. As he digs through the car he finds my sneak-a-toke and another one hitter in my friends bag. He now has two counts of paraphernalia against us. He keeps re asking us who we are and why we are there (trying to catch us lying) I will answer some of his questions be I don't say anything self incriminating. I admit nothing but my friends are not so strong willed. After looking through my car as thoroughly as he can with out breaking protocol. "So why are you guys in Phoenix?" "To go to a rave, we couldn't get in." "So you guys have a bunch of ecstasy in the car. Thats what people do at raves right?" "Fuck that shit, some people go for the dancing and music." "Right..." He comes up to me and asks pointblank what we were smoking out of, I know he knows I have a pipe in my pocket so i decide that I might as well give it to him, I really don't like the idea of giving a cop a pipe with weed in it but He knows it is there and already has plenty to arrest me for so I give it to him. A little while latter he comes back over (it felt like forever but it was probably like thirty seconds) and asks was that all the weed you guys have? I don't answer. He goes back to th car and pocks around a bit more then comes back over. "Look I'm going to be strait with you, If you give us the rest of your marijuana we will destroy it and let you guys leave with nothing but a ticket for driving without a license. I am serously conflicted, he is either a decent person who realizes we are just dumb kids and he has better shit to deal with or he is an evil pig and wants me to self incriminate so they can better press charges latter. I figure that at this point I am already in trouble for pipes and the weed in the pipe so I go for it. I still don't know how I decided other than to say it felt like he was legit. I tell him where my nugs are stashed in the car and he goes and grabs them and drops them in his bag of pipes. The female cop then exits the van and walks me over to my car and tells me she is going to remove my handcuffs. I sign the ticket for driving with out ID on you (A jail-able criminal offense in AZ just as a heads up) and lets us drive off into the night, after telling us it would be a good idea if we left phoenix. We drive back up to flagstaff, arrive around 2 a.m. (when they stop selling alcohol round here), on a hunch I decide to call this random Japanese guy who gave me his number and we get invited to a party and a friend of a friend's house. We get there and tell them of our adventures. One kid drives back to his house to get his weed and brings i back just so we could smoke it because the cops took all ours, he didn't even smoke with us. So we ended up getting drunk and high with a bunch of Asians and had a great end to an otherwise not so great day. I really, really hope those cops hot-boxed their van with my weed because both sacks were really good, but the older on was perfect. I would hate for those choice trees to be waisted. Those Asian kids were all super nice, really awesome people. I also got the charges for the license dropped since it was clear that I had lost my wallet hundreds of miles from home.Summary:
Summarize: I would like to say thank you for all the responses to my previous post: I talked to my boyfriend today. I told him how I felt disrespected and that I NEVER would do anal and I'm just not about it at all. I also told him that it was such a turn off to me when he would pester me about it during sex. He acted all pouty about it in a joking way but then apologized and said he wouldn't bring it up anymore. He said he didn't realized how much it bothered me and he just wants me to be happy. I think communication was lacking this whole time... Thanks to everyone for the encouragement to clear the air of this mess with him!Summary:
Summarize: As someone who loves Aatrox top here's how you should play it: Deck yourself out with offensive masteries and runes preferably, however if you don't want to kill your enemy/you need to be tanky for your team, get a defensive setup. Level 1 start out with W and switch to Blood Price, keep hitting minions and stack up your blood well for a retarded 50% attack speed bonus at level 1, don't worry about the lane being pushed, it will move only slightly at the beginning. Hit level 2 and get your Dark Flight, prime your Blood Price (or if you just used it, hit a minion once at least) and hit the enemy with your stun, hold ~ and right click your opponent and cut him to pieces (~ makes you target only champions, so it ensures you don't waste your autoattacks on minions), when your Blood Price is ready, ignite and smack him with the empowered attack. Afterwards chase with flash and kill him. But, if you're against a counterpick simply don't try to trade, because if Aatrox gets countered he gets countered hard (see: Jax). In that case simply farm up, get 2 points in your W and get a vampiric scepter asap + defensive stats.Summary:
Summarize: My freshman year of college, I was invited to an end of the year toga party, at a house called Kingwood, where all the theater and music majors gathered to get smashed. I had never been to a toga party before, and I didn't know that the togas were supposed to be baggy, so I used one of my roommate Natalia's hot pink bedsheets, and she and my best friend Sam spent about half an hour pinning and wrapping it into a slutty little minidress. I had just gotten a spray tan that day (I swear it wasn't orangey or "Jersey Shore"), my hair looked hot as hell, put on two bras and my tits looked fantastic. I put on my cute black 4 inch heels and a black belt, and I looked hot as hell, not gonna lie. Sam did something similar, and she looked amazing. I show up, and the whole party pretty much cheers and gasps, because I'm the only one there in a non-white sheet, looking sexy as hell, and most of the girls were jealous, because they hadn't thought of looking sexy at a toga party. I soon became the Slut of the Night. I got totally wasted, hit the bowl and the bong a couple of times, and went out back to smoke a cigarette. At this point, I'm feeling pretty loose and spacey. I attracted the attention of five guys, one of which I had a huge crush on, and four of which were fellow theater majors who I had most of my classes with and which I was pretty good friends. They were almost as drunk as I was, and I let all of them motorboat me, grab my tits, and smack my ass. I must have flashed about twenty people that night, and I'm sure I made out with and slutted it up with more than five guys, but I can't remember at this point. I don't care what anyone says, I was loving it. I'm a pretty sexual person, so it really didn't phase me. I also met this guy who was really interesting and sweet, and we made out all night. I must have looked so skanky and desperate, but I really didn't give a damn. I'm never the type of person to be a slutty attention whore, but it was the end of the year, I was transferring next year, and I thought fuck it , I'm gonna go hard. It was probably one of the few times in my life where I was loving being single. One of the only disadvantages of having a boyfriend is that I would feel pretty awful doing that nowadays.Summary:
Summarize: Your story is very similar to mine. I've had a forced feminization fetish for as long as I can remember, and it ramped up due to continual porn and masturbation over the years. For the longest time I was fine with it: being a shy kid with no romantic prospects, it was how I got off, so although it was odd, I just went with it. Once I started breaking out of my shell and pursuing relationships, I realized that this fetish had basically warped my brain and made normal relationships with girls really difficult. While I've gotten better with girls, I've developed ED and general sexual frustration, which has been very painful to face. I strongly believe that my reliance on my fetish, in addition to inexperience, has made it so that I can't function normally in "vanilla" sex, which is something I desperately want. I saw a sex therapist who definitely helped me deal with unfounded shame and guilt I felt about the fetish. But throughout this time, I've still felt that as much as I "enjoy" the fetish in terms of getting me off, I really have no desire to enact these fantasies in real life. I want to get off based off love, not humiliation. And I want healthy sex with girls, not with my hand in front of a computer. I've been trying NoFap for about a year, with my top streak at 52 days, and I'm determined to get 90 days and beyond. Among the goals I have is to weaken or maybe even eliminate my fetish. I don't know if a successful 90+ day reboot will do the trick, but at the very least I'm trying, and perhaps I can gain sensitivity to normal, fulfilling sex with girls without the fetish. I'm not sure what advice I can give you about informing your girlfriend, as I've grappled with the same kind of thing. I haven't told people in my day-to-day life about my fetish, although if a lasting relationship comes along, I'm sure I'll need to address it. In the meantime, best I can advise is keep at NoFap, try a successful reboot, and see how you feel about your fetishes afterwards once you've cleared out some of the cobwebs in your brain. This MUST include refraining from looking at porn, even if you aren't masturbating to it! That's certainly what I'm trying (and you're two weeks ahead of me!)Summary:
Summarize: How the fuck are people upvoting this? Drivers are part of the OS and android is linux based. Why do servers use linux? Because it doesn't need to reboot for updates (like windows). In addition, do you have problems if you take your trusty usb sticks and put them in your pc? It's the same thing, if you buy cheap shit off ebay you're going to have components that fail but surely the important ones will get to be implemented in their android (don't look at me like that, every single phone company has its own modified version of android, it's not a big deal to get the drivers in there). I'll give you that it's not going to be like arranging magnets on a fridge as a battery needs different connectors than a camera, but you don't need more pins between a 2mp camera and a 10 mp camera, especially not if you just upgrade the size of the lens. This would definitely work with some clever engineering. CPU's don't get smaller or larger, you will have a spot for the cpu. Doesn't matter if it's single or eight-core. Same goes for RAM. Then you'll have the battery in a place where you can extend it at the sacrifice of some other components and the rest will just be standard i/o.Summary:
Summarize: A couple years back I was traveling Europe as part of a Contiki tour, I was doing two tours back to back with 1 week in between the two. If you hadn't heard about Contiki it has been said to be a sex romp where everyone is there for a no strings attached good time.... in other words sex to you can't sex no more. The tour started in London and this is where the meet was for the first tour, I was traveling alone and am generally a shy bloke but everyone was friendly and there were other single travelers so I didn't feel as alone. We went through the meet and greet and everyone was cool, there were some great looking woman in the group but the two that stood out the most were these two Asian twins from Mexico, they were the talk of the group from both the men and woman and they had the accent to match their looks. I spoke to them briefly at the start and they were very chill, they were just there to sight see and take in the different cultures and spend time together as they both study in different locations. As the tour went on I became friendly with both, they both came across as very innocent and nice girls, I didn't think I had a shot and even if I did they were always close together, like they never left each others sight, always stayed in the same room as each other so there was never a chance for me or anyone else to attempt to make a move. In the group they were the only ones not getting down and dirty. Anyways, the 1st of my tours (2 week tour) was ending and everyone became pretty close to each other sharing such a great experience, it was pretty emotional knowing I won't be seeing any of these people again. As I was saying bye to the twins one of the twins said we've got a bit more time free then expected so we're thinking of continuing on after they visit Spain, she said she heard I was doing a Greece tour and asked for details and said I might see them there. I wasn't sure if they were going to show and I was impartial either way as it would be nice to know someone from the start and I didn't think I'll get anything so they could potentially end up being just cock blocks. Skip ahead 1 week, tour time comes and they are there.... hugs, nice to see you gals again, they were looking cuter than ever as they spent their week in the sun getting an amazing look tan... meet the rest of the group everyone seems cool. The tour was great and the twins were sociable but avoiding the extra "interactions", heaps of guys on the tour tried but didn't succeed. Skip ahead and it was our last night as a group together, Contiki had setup a private function party for us and another tour in one of the Halls on the Ship... It was all going pretty normal until I seen the twins skulling shots, I got a laugh out of it as I didn't expect it and just continued on outside talking to a couple girls from another tour I'd just met. The girls I just met were being very flirtatious and we were having a good laugh.....then one of the twins walked up to me mid conversation, sat in my lap and whispered, I want to see your cock tonight and walked away..... my eyes lit up, I was surprised and overly excited, the other girls asked me what she said I just nodded not paying attention to what they were saying but more focused on what do I do now, I was sitting there in a state of disbelief, I snapped out of it and had that confidence of knowing my night is sorted. Five minutes later the other twin walked up to me, then looked at the girls I was talking to and said he's mine tonight and walked away. WTFFFF the girls could not stop laughing, they were switching between shock that this little Asian bitch (In their words) had just tried to put it over them but at the same time laughing and saying props to the girl for claiming her intentions.... in the middle of all the laughing they realized that the it was a twin and not the same girl that had sat in my lap earlier and whispered something in my ear and then pushed me to tell them what. I told them and they were near pissing themselves, so much so that one of them had to cross her legs and lean forward. I was stumped, I had threesome with hot Asian twins screaming inside my head, that's something I had only ever imagined of typing into google. The girls I was talking to could not stop laughing and I have to say extremely cool as they knew I was in a unique predicament, they calmed down and gave me a bit of banter but were trying to give me advice on how to obtain the best possible scenario.. being a threesome ofc. I told them i don't think it's possible but I'll love it to be but would hate to think that if I hit them up for it they will both be disgusted and tell me to fuck off and I'll end up with neither. It was decided I should walk up to them when they are both alone together as ask, who's up for a good time in a joking manner, that way If it's on I will know if it's not I will know and would not have ruined the chance. The twins had made their way outside and were sitting by themselves, I walked up to them and sat near them and said who's up for some fun tonight.... lol they both instantly gave me the look of a cute smile which said me but....shhh and changed the topic, that pretty much answered my question. I stayed and sat with them and we were having an innocent conversation, each time i tried to steer in another direction one of them will change the subject. All while each was giving me smiles which were smiles I hadn't seen before and one was rubbing my leg under the table. I was in a state of mind fuck and was getting pretty frustrated with it all as they both were keen but were trying to keep it a secret from their sister. I told the girls I was going to get a drinks and asked if one of them wanted to help me carry since I only had two hands, it was a plan to get them separated, once of them popped up and said I will. We went to the bar and I told the twin that came with me, you know I only came to get a drink to get you separated from your sister, she had a laugh and said yeah I've been waiting for you to make a move, I told her well it's hard when you both have glue for clothing, I thought it was a lame joke but she found it funny.... she then said, what if it was my sister that offered the help lol I was thinking we would be having the same conversation but I told her I would have had to think of something different. I then told her I find her crazy sexy but this level of tease isn't healthy, is something going to happen? She said I hope so and then told me once we get back to the table, she's going to play of tipsy and ask her sister to stay out and enjoy her night, she told me her room number and then told me to meet her there. Boom, that sounds like a solid plan. We make it back to the table, have a couple drinks and as planned she says sorry guys I feel pretty tipsy, I'm to have a early one. Her sister asked if she was ok but was looked pretty excited by all this and told her she was going to stay up for a while and to call if she needed anything. Helping hand twin began to walk away, and before I could think of how to get myself following her. The other twin told me, how far is your room and grabbed me. They both had a switch that went from innocent to bad girl, it was such a turn on. I felt guilty but what was I to do, I wasn't going to tell her sorry I can't your sister is faking head spins in hopes to separate from you to sleep with me. We ended up going back to the room, It was magic but I had some guilt in the back of my mind... I was thinking what the fuck is her sister thinking, does she know? We went at it for around an hour between foreplay and solid action. We had some post sex talk, and laughs and I then jumped in the shower and when I was done she had fallen asleep. I changed my underwear and threw on the same clothes and went back out and joined the others, I told the girls I was speaking with at the start what had happened... I was the highlight of their night, they couldn't stop laughing and I told them that the helping hand one could still be waiting for me and joked that I should go, and didn't plan on going as I'm sure she would either be pissed off, know what happened or most likely be asleep. They told me I better go and If i didn't then it will be slack to her, and kept saying better late then never and what's the worst that could happen. I think they just pressured me so that can have this random story to tell their friends. I ended up going, scared to knock on the door but I did and she was ready, she didn't ask or want to hear what took me so long but was she was very happy I came. It was amazing, even though I was tired they were both very special girls that gave me a night never to forget.... She told me I better leave before her sister got back, which i did and then got back to my room as her sister was getting dressed, gave me a kiss and said I better get back to my room before my sister wakes up.Summary:
Summarize: You are evil for doing that. My name is Luke and all I ever hear from people is "I am your father". Though it doesn't help that I've never met my father, it makes their comment much more relevant and plausible.Summary:
Summarize: Depends on your current MMR. Also, duo queueing gives you less lp so I'd imagine your wins don't count as much if you were going soloq. Besides, the goal of ranked isn't go in at an insanely high position, you don't want to get carried to gold 5 then be severely outclassed and lose every game when you belong in silver, because you can't go down unless you go inactive for a good month. Play ranked to learn and get better and you'll find which rank you belong to. People think you get 'trapped' in bronze but for me starting off low means there's less pressure on me because everyone is at the same level and I can work at the pace I want without the worry of throwing the game. I thought I was in elo hell and that my noob team got me into bronze but honestly it's where I belong and I'm glad I'm able to work up from here instead of being inadequate at silver.Summary:
Summarize: I was 19, with two friends, and we decided to go smoke pot at a nearby park. I believe I had only smoked once before in my life, a few weeks earlier. I happened to be driving on this occasion, and was not too keen about smoking in my car. We got out, and each smoked enough, probably lucky that we were by a smelly trash pile. We were wondering where to put the weed, and I had my friend stash it in his pocket. Just then, a squad car pulls up. I guess we were there after the park was closed. We played it cool, and just at that point a second squad pulls up. They stand at their cars, with there headlights shining on us, for what seemed like 20 minutes. Meanwhile, we're standing there, pretending to have a conversation with animated gestures to show that we weren't nervous. Finally they came to my car, shined the flashlight around inside it, told us we were free to go. The one officer leaves, the second backs up and just waits for me. I had never driven a car stoned at this point, so I was scared as fuck, but pulled it off like a pro.Summary:
Summarize: I'm sorry, I don't mean to sound negative but... Wings is apparently big guy. As it seems a really... big guy. He can build muscles... but exercise is more than likely going to help him lose weight, not build it. I'm not quite sure if he's lost a lot of weight or just under 50 pounds, but until he gets down to at least 300, his body is going to be wanting to burn the excess weight. Of course, muscle will build, but there's just so much excess fat in the body that will go first.Summary:
Summarize: First of all, your waiter was a fucking moron. Second of all, beers are almost always served in a standard glass so all you need to do is tell them the name of the beer you want - "I'll have a Fat Tire". If they have it both on tap and in bottles, they'll usually ask you which one. Most craft beer pubs will serve higher octane or rarer beers in smaller tulip glasses, so if you try to order a pint of Angel's Share they'll tell you it comes in a tulip. The general rule around here is 8%+ in smaller glasses. Unless you get lucky, when my local golf course started carrying craft beer they served everything (I mean EVERYTHING) in pint glasses for the first few weeks. We're talking Stone Vertical Epic 11-11-11, Stone 15th Anniversary, 12% barleywines, etc. That was awesome, but they've wised up since. Still, they only have two sizes, pints and 12oz tulips, so they're still pretty decent size beers. Some bars will have 22oz glasses as well so they'll ask you "large or small", or one local place calls the large ones "papa size". So in that case, large=22oz, small=16oz.Summary:
Summarize: Third wave feminism is terrible, Anita Sarkeesian is a total cunt, and all of this "privilege" is bullshit. People just wanting to have something to be offended at. Mens rights activists are dumbasses as well. All this political correctness is terrible. It's turning everyone into special snowflakes who believe they are oppressed in one way or another.Summary:
Summarize: Havel's isn't punished enough, agree. Wanting armour is not something you can bitch about, though. Generally this list is totally fair and I agree, but being annoyed by someone being tanky as they can be is just ridiculous. Also, I like how Havel's looks and I have the stats to use it with large weapons for that reason. Does that make me a bad player? Because I'm just playing the fashion souls, same as you. Yeah, I invade. But it's in the Crypt, and my aim is intimidation not getting kills. Full Havels with the Warlock Mask and a Red Eye ring is scary, especially when you just walk at people after doing the decapitate emote. 8)Summary:
Summarize: Hmm, Nogens Johansen, Photographer frequently in 'The West Australian' news paper, assuming OC (Karma Decay finds no match so it pretty safe to assume) OP is likely Australian, from WA, A quick check shows comments about Australian indigenous culture and other Australian comments, WA has a large indigenous population, along with NT, further suggesting OP is Australian. Judging by common posted subbreddits (WTF, guns, boltedontits and Hardbodies) its safe to assume OP is male, by the content of other comments (In Android, Screenwriting, AndroidGames, Politics and technology) OP is likely experienced with modern technology and educated (In one recent post he mentions taking part in a Uni Communications class, suggesting he is/was attending University), the content of his posts and using referances for debates or to prove a point also supports this.... Though spacedicks may offset that... One post mentions he was offered a contract as a screenwriter, so likely does that in addition to a low-mid range paying job. He has had 3 other , along with many other minor/failed posts.Summary:
Summarize: Little bit long but this story means the world to me, had to share with my Ents...I am on cloud right now. On Friday, I had my final interview with a big investment bank in NYC (obviously can't name them). It's my dream job to work on Wall Street and I was shocked I had made it so far with so much other talent vying for the spot. I had to pay for college myself, and I didn't go to the best school but I worked my ass off and focused on getting good grades. The last round of interviews took place with the head of HR. Typical business type: serious attitude, expects a lot of the employees and takes no shit. I was so nervous that I was gonna say something stupid and f*ck up my chances. And that's exactly what I did...or so I thought. After the usual questions about why I want the position, Mr. HR man throws me a real curveball- "What do you like to do to relax?". Instantly, my mind goes to that fat 2 gram J that's waiting for me in the car (was planning on celebrating if things went well). I froze for a second and stammered a bit, and Mr. HR took advantage of me being caught off guard. To my complete horror the worst words I could imagine came out of his mouth: "You like to smoke weed son?". I nearly shit myself and all the color left my face. I saw my whole future flash before my eyes, all the dreams and hopes that I had carried with me for so long vanished. I sat there for what seemed like 5 years, until I could finally blurt out that I had never touched drugs but he put his hand up with the fire of a thousand suns in his eyes. I thought for sure he was going to throw me out of his office right there. We're sitting in silence, me completely devastated that I had thrown away the best job opportunity ever, and him looking like he could kill me on the spot. Then, out of nowhere, he starts laughing his ass off. I'm still completely frozen I have no idea what to do. He tells me I'm an excellent candidate, and that if I smoke weed I should fit in just fine around here. He offered me the job right on the spot, and next thing I know I'm sitting in my car unable to believe what just happened to me. I drove home and roasted this fat doob in celebration (and to make my heart stop racing). Thinking of you ents! I hope y'all have as awesome a day as I did!Summary:
Summarize: Yasuo isn't a cancer champ. He is already laughably weak in lane, and doesn't have anywhere near the amount of power that he used to have mid game. On top of this his transition to mid game is even shittier because his Q no longer has a reduced cd per level. This just makes his laning phase literally the worst in the game if the enemy laner has more than two brain cells to rub together.Summary:
Summarize: Similar story, not told to me, but to my husband by an employee. This is an adult, too, not a child, so that rather ups the hilarity, in my opinion. So this lady had a history of calling out sick all the time, leaving work early over supposed emergencies and in general being a shitty employee(my husband did not have the right to fire her or she would have been gone within a week; upper management refused to do anything about it). So they finally vaguely threaten to fire her and she shapes up for about a month. Then, three weeks ago, she tells my husband she needs to leave work early because she isn't feeling well and thinks she needs to go to the hospital. Husband think this is kind of odd since most people are pretty ill before a trip to the hospital is needed and she seems fine but whatever, he lets her go early. She doesn't show up for work for the next 8 days. Finally calls in saying she was in the hospital for 8 days after having heart problems. Everyone knows, based on her history, that she is full of complete and utter bullshit. My husband's father had a heart attack last year and was in the hospital for three days. No way this lady, on shitty restaurant health insurance, is in the hospital with heart problems for eight days. But whatever, they tell her she needs to come in with a doctor's note. She says ok. Doesn't show up for another week. Calls in, claims she had to go back in the hospital for another week. Same routine, come in, show us a doctor's note. She says ok. Calls back the next day saying her dog ate her doctor's note. This is a 35 year old woman with 3 kids, so let me repeat that. She claimed her dog ate her doctor's note. One of the other managers, at this point, barely able to hold back his laughter, says he's so sorry, but she'll have to get a copy of the doctor's note and bring it in. She shows up the next day with forged doctor's notes. They're clearly fake, so the manager makes her sit outside his office for 40 minutes while he gets on the phone with her doctor to verify, that they are, in fact, forgeries. Like a dumbass, she waits to be caught. He then fires her.Summary:
Summarize: I'm 25, female, bisexual. I used to dislike women. I was one of those nerdy tomboy girls. Buried in books, science experiments, and later in a computer. Growing up, I always preferred guys for friends. They were drama-free, objective, not easily distracted in arguments/discussions and knowledgable. They also didn't snigger behind your back for your stupid sleeves and didn't spend all their time talking about crushes. They didn't mind aggressive logic. I liked all of this and secretly disliked girls because they were often shallow, not very persistent when it came to acquiring skills, etc. Except, I also had strong girl crushes. Go figure. Anyway, at some point after I started working fulltime, all this started changing. Increasingly, I find that most guys are incurably shallow. They bitch about losing. They degrade women. They cling to a strange notion of toxic masculinity -- they are terrified of anything that might "emasculate" them (many straight guys I know have difficulty imagining themselves as gay in a hypothetical next birth). They boast about their sexual conquests. They are woefully ignorant and prejudiced about several things related to sex and women. Their band of curiosity is narrow. At the same time, I'm starting to come across more and more cool women. Extremely intelligent, curious, insightful, fair (as in objective and interested in fairness), empathetic, fiercely logical, and so on. Even some of the stupid girls I knew -- not all, but some -- suddenly grew into women with whom I'd gladly be stuck in an abandoned island. What's even worse is this: I've started to believe, more and more, that a man and a woman could never replicate the intensity of the intimacy that can happen between two women. I feel like I can never cut past the fog in a man's mind, and he can never cut past the fog in mine. Men seem so incredibly uninterested in psychological intimacy. Or is it just the ones I've known? (And by psychological intimacy, I do not mean sharing secrets or repeating your life history -- not that anything's wrong with that -- and what I do mean is unfortunately hard to describe...) I've come to believe that women's minds and bodies are much more complex and interesting than men's. There is one more thing. I've always been able to easily brush off the constant male-oriented view of things. Not sexist things, you understand, just things where the writer/speaker assumes you are a straight white male. I'd brush it off and focus on the point of discussion. This is becoming harder and harder. I'm more and more resentful of that way of looking at the world. It's often said/done with no fault at all on the part of the writer/speaker but it still irritates me. Take this short story for example -- Cathedral by Raymond Carver and even that is such a trigger to me. I obsessed over every tiny objectifying/annoying thing he said about his wife. It's not the central point of the story but it's what took over my mind. This is so stupid. I will be handicapped by this because it takes away my objectivity. Now with these diseased eyes, I view every great author with suspicion. All of them seem to assume a male-oriented slightly-female-objectifying view of the world. This wouldn't matter, but I hate that I'm missing out on their great storytelling and writing because of my stupid hangup. Anyway. Wall of text. I'm somewhat ashamed of this. It feels great to finally write it out. Also, I really really hope that I am utterly wrong, and I've just met a strange sequence of people in my life that has led me to this conclusion. Because I like the idea of the world having more interesting people rather than less.Summary:
Summarize: It's okay, I had a friend last semester who was browsing reddit in class and saw a harmless "Happy Easter!" post on the front page. He pulls it up in the MIDDLE OF CLASS and it is none other than a massive throbbing dick. I watched the reaction of him quickly putting his hands over the screen as I'm trying to not fall out of my desk laughing while he tries to figure out what to do next. I was also not the only one who saw, because the girls around me started laughing as well.Summary:
Summarize: I see alot of friends and fellow blades getting bitter with women and my heart weeps. Don't be bitter, just brush it off as the amusing and silly girls who will run in and out of your life. I have had women completely ignore my texts over a week so i just let it lie, maybe send them invites to large events i may go to (nothing personal strictly copy-paste) over a few months. Just chill on it and talk to other women and otherwise occupy my time. A couple months later hit them up with game possibly improved, see whats good, smash. Not 100% but i'd give it 30% odds. Don't miss out on good pussy guys. A woman's idle emotional whims are nothing to get upset over.Summary:
Summarize: Hey! I think you should totally go for it and it sounds like you're getting your shit together early on! I'm a filmmaker in my early 20s and knew a BUNCH of people who came into film school saying the same thing you're saying. After graduating I can count on one hand the people who may actually have a chance at that. I'm not one of them, and I am very happy not to be. Keep in mind no matter how hard your work or how much time you put into it you aren't that Oscar before you're 25 if you don't have a genuine passion for the art of film and filmmaking. I'm not saying you don't have passion, you clearly do, but I firmly believe that you have to be willing to let the work be its own reward, and potentially give up the oscar in favor of making a film that you are happier with. I know a guy who's directed a ton of shorts and had an internship in LA and is probably one of the most disciplined filmmakers I knew. He got the drive, but he doesn't explore his art, and his films suffer for it. PM me if you need help with any post production/animation!Summary:
Summarize: So I'll keep this short, about 7 months ago (by recommendation from this subreddit), I built my own gaming PC. Trying to think of the best upgrade now. Specs; 8gb Corsair Vengeance RAM AMD FX6300 CPU Aftermarket CPU cooling Sapphire Radeon r9 270 4gb OC 1tb HDD (considering moving to SSD) Zalman Z11+ case Recently got a gaming mouse, keyboard and headphones. Play on a 42 inch 1080p LCD TV. Anyhow, I have some spare cash (about £150 $200), and seeing as gaming is a major hobby of mine I figure I'd invest it. Considered a few things. Upgrading RAM to 16gb (don't see much point though tbh) Using a projector (probably too complicated for my room) Moving to SSD (not sure it's worth it, they are expensive) So that's pretty much what I'm asking for help with, what would be a wise upgrade? Doesn't have to be a PC part per say - could be a useful gadget or anything related.Summary:
Summarize: No, you're totally ready! We've all been there and we all made it out alive. You can too! When I was getting ready to graduate college, I developed a strategy that has been highly useful in so many things. I'm a big list person, so if you like lists (and crossing shit off of lists like a motherfucker) then this will work well for you. Write down the thing you want to happen. (E.G. "Rent an apartment") Take this ONE thing (don't let your other worries invade at the moment) and figure out what all needs to happen. Write down each individual task that needs to happen. It's super super important that every item on this list is an action that can be accomplished. As a bonus, make the list very specific so it keeps you on task and lets you cross lots of stuff off. If the list in step 2 is not prioritized, do that now. Rewrite the list in order of importance or the order in which things need to get done. Make a plan for doing the items on your list. Most things don't get completed in one day. Break your list into multiple days and make sure that you are always making progress. Get to work! You've totally spec-ed out your work, and now the only thing left to do is to get that shit done. I promise this method (if you apply it to your personality and lifestyle) will work. If you adjust appropriately, you can even use this methodology to answer the hard questions of life, like "what kind of job should I get," "do I really want to move that far away," "what do I do with my college degree," "should I be dating that person." I've used this method to: Quit a job Talk with people on the phone (I'm still working on not being nervous when I call people...) Apply to grad school Take exams / write massive papers Rent an apartment Buy appliances Get my utilities set up for the first time Not let my dreams get demolished after getting denied on a mortgage Buy a goddamned house (even after my loan was denied) We are so lucky to live in this era. You know why? Because there are billions of people who have gone through similar situations and have had the same questions... and we all bring our questions to the same place: the internet. If you have a question you pull up Google and ask away... I guarantee someone has had your question before.Summary:
Summarize: I had a vegan as a legal guardian for 2 years when I was 15. Biggest fucking bitch this side of the planet. She would always force her bullshit veganism on me. When I had enough of her shit food (she was a shit cook), I decided to get a job to buy the food (read: meat, cheese, eggs) that I wanted. Nope. She would not allow me to store meat or any other non vegan food in the fridge . So I said I would save up and buy a mini-fridge. Also nope. She said if I wanted to eat meat, I would have to find another place to live. That's exactly what I did. I called up my mom and convinced her to take me back. I lived in Alberta at the time, and she flew me all the way back to Québec. I flipped my entire life upside down just to get away from that crazy bitch Best. Decision. Ever.Summary:
Summarize: My family used to breed pitbulls. Any dog has the tools and strength to become powerfully aggressive and fuck you up. After watching four generations of pitbulls grow up into the sweetest, most loyal dogs ever, I can tell you with absolute certainty that there is a complete bias towards pitbulls. I have never been attacked by one of the dogs. If you raise a dog to be aggressive, it will be aggressive. If you raise a dog the right way, good job, you now have a companion that will follow and protect you.Summary:
Summarize: So, I recently found out that I qualify for the BOGW (Board of Governor's Waiver - in California) which effectively waives all my enrollment and class fees. In addition, I qualify for about $5,800 for a year in grants through FAFSA. I will be attending a CC next year in California where I will be fully supporting myself financially. However, I still need to pay for almost $900 a month in personal expenses for housing/food/utilities, etc because the city I live in is very expensive and my parents live in another state. (I have been in California supporting myself without going to school for the past three years since I graduated high school and finally have a desire to go to college) I may need to take out loans to support myself while maintaining a solid focus on school to be able to make the grades needed to transfer to the 4-year of my dreams (also an in-state school). I plan to get a job, but balancing a school with a part-time job will not only be stressful (although possible), may not meet me minimum financial need to make it through school at this point in time. My parents are unable to co-sign a loan due to their poor financial situation paired with poor credit. What do my options look like in terms of paying for school? I have already applied for MANY scholarships but have not heard any good news back yet.Summary:
Summarize: Hi there! I started a month ago with the keto-diet. Primary, as a long shot, hoping to get rid of some Lipoma, which has been reported from some participants and secondly to get rid of a few pounds. I am right now training for a half-marathon (my first yaiks!) and I noticed something interesting. I used to run 10k (6.2miles) in under 50 minutes and with a heart rate avg of around 150-160. But after two weeks into keto I couldn't keep up with my time. If I sticked to my usual pace, my heart rate was through the roof. The last two runs in this distance class I averaged with 180bpm, which is insane. I felt like shit after the runs and was a bit devastated. Yesterday I oriented myself not on my pace anymore, but on my heart rate. I could easily run 13k (8miles) without feeling exhausted but with a pace 1.5 minute slower than I was used to. I am now wondering: Is this a result of ketosis? Have you experienced something similar regarding endurance sports? How long did it take you to get to your former condition?Summary:

Summarize: So last month I broke up with my boyfriend we were at the mall and I took his hand I told him how much he meant to me and how the past 2 years have been great, but there's someone else. But I feel really bad for him, I see him around campus sometimes and he looks really sad and lonely, when we broke up for some reason our friends stuck with me and ditched him. It was not even a bad breakup, to make thing's worse my new BF will yell things at him to I don't know piss him off he will call him farm boy, farm slave, farm homo. (he grew up on a farm and he came to the big city I guess to study medicine, he does not really have anyone here) I have told him to fucking stop it and he always argues " your my girlfriend stop sticking up for your ex" and we get into huge arguments about it and I am seriously on the verge of dumping his ass. I am even saw him at a campus party and he tried talking to people, but because my new boyfriend is like really popular around here and I think they know him they blew him off. But the main thing is, is their anything you can do for your ex to make them feel better. because it's not like he is not trying to move on, it just seems like the universe is fucking with him and not letting himSummary:
Summarize: Yeah, abortions tricky, as the further along you get, its harder to justify and can in fact be harmful. I don't like the concept of a "line" though. Everyones circumstances are different, they can't be judged by a single guideline. That being said, in the example of abortion, as you get further and further along, it does get into a grey area, so unfortunately there does need to be a line, unless there's some great medical risk or reason in performing one. I'd say that having sex with a 17 year old is much more of a grey area actually. Physically and mentally there is 0 difference between a 17 and 364 day year old and an 18 year old. That being said,There must be a line drawn somewhere, has to be. I just think it's ridiculous that one day you can be chided for even expressing that a 17 year old is sexually attractive (still inappropriate) , and the very next day she can be told to post her butthole on the internet (Any non-lore game of thrones thread about Sansa Starks actress is horrifyingly ripe with this). Its still equally inappropriate, but somehow more socially acceptable (on the internet at least). Well, that got long....Summary:
Summarize: Oh, I know what it was illustrating. However, I also know that a woman feeding dogs in an animal shelter has nothing to do with "crunch times". You're assuming the homeless subsist only on donations (they don't), and also that those donations have some kind of hard limit that is less than sufficient to fill demand (they don't). By your suggestions, human beings should feel compelled to help no one but those of their own species (because uhh... innate evolutionary pressures, I guess?? Totally not the same evolutionary pressures that drove us to create a mutually benfiicial partnership with other species though, amirite?), and so people wouldn't be helping dogs and the point would be moot. (Nevermind that of course people would be helping dogs, people run into burning buildings or jump into water to save dogs all the fucking time.) However, people are helping other animals besides humans, so there must not be the sense of some sinking boat (or certainly not one that feeding homeless people is going to do a damn bit of good for).Summary:
Summarize: I know I'm late to this now but I want to comment anyway. It was when I was about 15 and I ended up telling my dad I hated him. We had been arguing several times a week for quite a while and this time seriously set me off. We were arguing about some yard work or something and it got to the point where I was tearing up and just wanted to be alone. So I ran inside, all while my dad is following and still yelling at me, and I said to go away, we'll talk when we're not mad. He is literally 2 inches from my sobbing face, sitting in the corner of my room still screaming and I finally looked up and said those three words. I hate you. It crushed him and myself as soon as the words left my mouth. I'm actually kind of tearing up now thinking about it. He left me alone until later that night when he sat down and calmly talked to me. I knew my dad had an abusive childhood but I didn't know how bad. He tells me how my grandfather has never said "I love you" in the 45 years he has been alive. Not once. And how he was hugged for the first time by him recently during a rough patch in my parents marriage. Anyways, we hugged it out and told him I didn't mean it, I just wanted him to leave me alone. This was years and years ago but I still wish I never said it. My parents are now in the middle of a divorce so my dad moved in with my grandfather to take care of him through his battle with cancer. It's really brought that side of the family closer together which is really nice to see. Grandpa is on the way to full recovery but I cannot say the same about the divorce. That shit's still going down.Summary:
Summarize: Less than 8 hours, can't remember exactly what time I met him. We were already students in the same class but I'm shy and mostly keep to myself. There was a round of introductions going around because we volunteered to move around some equipment (this is in a community college building that shares a graphic design studio and a video production studio, complete with all of the necessary equipment to conduct a mock newscast). What started as a little light-hearted teasing about my awkwardness turned into a few raunchier jokes (something about Pornhub). By this time it was around 5 PM, which is considered really late since half of the other students usually leave by lunch, and the rest filter out by about 3; I was staying late to do work on a project. We left because the guy in charge of the building left. We chatted outside for a while, and then somehow it turned into an invitation for sexual congress. I wasn't even attracted to him but since I was a kissless virgin And I wasn't dense, I said yes. I led him to a bathroom that I knew was out of the way so there would be less traffic. I was so hopped up on nerves and adrenaline that I couldn't cum, but getting a blowjob felt great. He also fucked my ass, but his trouser snake was more akin to a fucking boa constrictor (one guess as to what ethnicity); I couldn't take more than 4 or 5 inches before it hurt. He finished on my ass, we cleaned up, and parted ways.Summary:
Summarize: So I started a new job in December working at a pharmacy. I love the job as a whole. But I'm getting paid barely above minimum wage and I'm getting part time hours. I can barely pay the few bulla I have while living at home. My prolem comes into play with a potential new job. My friend set up a job interview for me tomorrow and she's sure I will get the position. I've always had a problem quitting jobs. But this job would be full time and more pay. The problem I have is I love the people I work and I really respect my bosses. They also kind of intimate me and I'm afraid of backlash for quitting. I'm not sure if I would be able to give a full two weeks notice. Maybe a week at most. And I would feel like such an asshole for that. But it's such a better opportunity for me. I guess I'm just really worried about if I do have to quit without much notice, working with my bosses and co workers and things being wierd or awkward. I have really bad anxiety about it and we work so closely together and I still rely on them a lot since I'm still fairly new and im just freaking out. Is it wrong for me to not give a fil keep weeks notice? What is the best way to being it up to my boss? Any ways I can prevent the cold shoulder from my bosses and co workers?Summary:
Summarize: It's one of those things in life you don't what how you are going to react. My father passed away after a complicated brain surgery from which he never regained consciousness again up until the day he died, 10 days later. It was a very difficult emotional rollercoaster, because in addition to it, my brother was hospitalized because of a thrombosis he had on the brain. After three weeks of treatment my brother was discharged and the doctors are very optimistic that he is going to recover 98, 100%. The very day he was discharged he arrived at the wake for my father and stayed for a couple of hours. Look, I don't want to victimize myself or being pitied upon. I didn't know wakes could be so complicated and it is all a big blur in my mind, people coming and going... I remember I introduced her to an uncle she never met before and so far, she knew everyone. Then she went missing, she said she went outside with the family of a friend of mine, but I didn't saw her again until she asked if it would be alright if she went home. I said sure and later, she called me almost weeping to tell me she felt neglected and not part of the family because I didn't introduce her to other people. I didn't knew what to say except "sorry", but of course, that wasn't enough, se wanted to know her exact place in our relationship, yes, right there on the phone and me still in the wake. I had to go outside to listen to her claims. The next day, my father's remains were cremated and she was there. To tell the truth, I was distant from her most of the time, I know I did, I was angry at her. We took the ashes to the family crypt and she was there and I was distant too. Later that day, she apologized, but I am still hurt, I am still angry that during the most difficult day of my life, she was as important if not more important that what was happening to me. And after I told here this, she said it wasn't fair because she said sorry. And she still claims that I was rude to her and didn't give her her place as my partner. Now I want to dump her, say we are not right for each other (I'm not saying I am perfect, far from it, but I am trying to be honest, but with all this emotion I don't know if I am) and let's move on, but my therapist says I shouldn't rush into making decisions in my emotional state. I think my therapist is right, but it's difficult to live like this for me right now. Am I being too sensitive? too unforgiving? Thanks Reddit So,Summary:
Summarize: I was in Atlantic City for my friends 21st birthday. He got obliviously drunk so I decided I was going to do my own thing, play the games I want and not deal with him. This is after I told myself that I would NEVER attend another 21st birthday because its the same bullshit over and over. So I bounce and play some craps. Im shooting dice well and I get a call from him, I pick up and he asks "Should I buy coke?" And of course I say "yes" and he tells me to go back to the room. So I run upstairs, run down the hallway, open the door to the room to find my friend and 2 random, thug ass, black dudes with crazy jewelry on. Now these dudes towered myself and my buddy by inches and Im 6 ft tall. So I act cool and buy some blow. I questioned the quality of the blow and their tone of voice became very aggressive and they became very jumpy. The guy holding then took out a credit card and shoveled this coke up my nose. It tasted terrible and was cleary cut with dog shit and didnt get me high, especially with the amount they jammed up my nose. Just to get them out if my face we bought a gram for $60 snd they got out of there. Before they left, they questioned my earrings. I told them they were purchased at Walmart for 12.99, which they were, and he grilled them sooooo hard. I thought he was gonna start robbing us. They would have gotten away with it, too. Then we blew the dawg shit coke, trying to convince ourselves that it wasnt beat. So then my friend locked his wallet in the room lock box, and wasnt able to open it for an hour, due to the fact ge kept putting in the wrong pin code. Thats when I left him alone in the room and I went back to the craps table.Summary:
Summarize: Hello Reddit. I made a similar post in /r/askgaybros but everyone just generally told me to stop being a slut and use condoms. I figured I would try here and see if I could get better clarity / direction on what I should do. My confession is simple. I'm 22 and I've had sex with 193 guys, and more often than not, condoms wouldn't be used. I genuinely don't want to be in this situation. Let me start from the beginning. I used to be on gay chatrooms and whatnot as a kid (remember Mogenic? lol). Anyway, I ended up meeting a guy when I was 15. He was 20 or so. We just chilled and one thing led to another and we did it. Goodbye virginity! I don't regret it but I might have acted differently in hindsight. So first in addressing the sex element. I would sneak out and have sex with guys, until I was 18 and would be able to leave home without any issues (I couldn't before because I was doing my Year 12 / HSC study / still was in school). I don't know what it is, I just like sex. I like it when guys fuck, I like it when we make out. I just like feeling wanted. I'm not sure if it's a sex addiction or something, but there have been days before where I would just lie in bed and do nothing but "the deed" consecutively , by myself of course; maybe 4-5 times before I get up out of bed? It's weird. Once I'm determined / in this sexualised state, nothing will stop me from achieving what I want. In the past I've driven 2 hours away to meet with a guy, even sneaking out in all hours of the morning, i.e. midnight to like 3AM. I've had one night where I slept with three different guys in the same night. I don't know why I do it, apart from it feeling good. I just know if I'm going to do it, it'll happen. I've ended in some semi-dangerous situations, like meeting guys from Craigslist in a dark park. I was set upon and had to punch / run away. The other bit is the condom bit. The guy that took my virginity didn't use a condom, and neither did most guys I met when I was 15-17. It just never occurred. Like, literally, it was just straight in as is. I did have sex-ed, but maybe it's the Australian system but we just talked about heterosexual sex so I just figured I wouldn't get pregnant, so why bother? It feels good anyway. That kind of thought followed me throughout my teenage years until I hit 18 and realised what had transpired, and I genuinely just assumed I must have HIV. I'm a pretty cluey individual, so I figured, if I never get checked, I'll never be told I have HIV, so then I can tell guys I'm clean because I've never actually had it proven that I had it, so I didn't want to get tested. The other thing was I was still denying my homosexuality at that point in time, despite having been with 50 guys or so. I was in the closet and lied to myself. I tricked myself into being straight. Anyway, don't worry, that phase of my life was short and I did end up getting checked once I found out about these sexual health clinics that you can go to anonymously. First time I went, results came back and I had everything (except HIV and herpes). I was shocked. But I was treated and got over it. For some reason I still slept with guys bareback. I don't know why, it was just normal for me. The other guy would never bring it up so I assumed why not? I'm thinking it's also linked to my lack of self esteem, which meant I really wanted to please the guy so he wouldn't reject me or something. Anyway... moving forward. The same kind of behaviour transpired up until recently. Why you ask? Well, I kinda just realised how stupid I was in doing all this. It was only when I came here on Reddit and explained my story that it made sense. Since I was in the closet, none of my friends knew -- sorry, correction, they were sure I was gay but just played along with it because they didn't want me to get upset. So I didn't have anyone close to tell them about my sex-capades, no-one to judge, no-one to open up to. I had free reign over this "person" that I became, the sex addicted barebacker. Now I'm worried no guy will want me because, I mean, who would? I've been with so many guys. It's embarrassing and makes me sad when I think about it, and I have no idea now it got this bad. I can't feel like I can truly be me around people because I'm scared they will judge me. Someone in the other thread said I was a classic example of behavioural economics, in that, I didn't see the risk in barebacking / didn't care. It's almost subconscious. I just don't understand why I do it / continue to do it (sometimes). The same way I would literally study for an exam the night before even if I had a whole week off. My mind just doesn't want to do what's right for me, it's all about gratuitous pleasure. I guess I don't have much willpower. I don't know who or where to turn to. How do I change? I can see and believe that if I keep this up, I will end up with HIV or something worse. But at the same time I just let all logic fly out the window when I'm making out with a guy and he's about to stick it in. Even worse if I'm on amyl, it's just like "fuck, let's do it". I just don't understand, like FUCK. What is wrong with me?Summary:
Summarize: There are two things in your reply that I would like to address: > not all abusers committed murder. But the correct question was, of those who killed their spouses, what percentage had histories of being abusers? That answer if, of course, a high percentage. I am too young to have closely followed the OJ trial, but it would seem that the defense argument was entirely relevant. The question "is domestic abuse a significant predictor of murder" seems appropriate. The question, "Is murder a significant predictor of domestic abuse" is irrelevant, unless you're trying to prove that a known murderer also abused his/her spouse. Consider the following example: Being a professional chef is a significant predictor of owning a set of good kitchen knives (in other words, a larger percentage of chef's own good knives than the general pop). It does not follow that owning a set of good kitchen knives is a significant predictor of being a professional chef. In the case of the pornography study, committing adultery is identified as a significant predictor of viewing porn. It does not follow that viewing porn is a significant predictor of adultery. In other words, there is nothing in the study that suggests porn leads to adultery. >how much more likely where they to have used pornography? 3x as much seems non-trivial to me This reveals a misunderstanding of the odds ratio. The actual difference in probability of viewing pornography is different from the odds ratio. Let's assume that 3/4 (75%) adulterers view porn and 2/4 (50%) non-adulterers view porn. The odds of viewing porn is the probability of viewing divided by the probability of not viewing. For adulterers, this is (75%/25%)=3. For non-adulterers, this is (50%/50%)=1. The odds ratio is (3/1)=3. So in this example, even though the odds ratio is 3, adulterers are only ((75%-50%)/50%)=50% more likely to view porn than non-adulterers. Not 3x. >But this is not the only study I've looked at other studies. I haven't done a comprehensive review-- but what I have seen has been really poorly conducted. If you think there is an article with solid evidence out there that suggest porn viewing leads to marital infidelity-- I'd love to see it. Honestly, I would. I have been unable to find such an article. Edit:Summary:
Summarize: I worked as a supervisor at a shitty service-industry venue in Portland, OR, for about 5 years. There were 3 other supervisors, and also my boss, the General manager. In the first year there, I was obviously the fresh meat, the new guy, so I got a lot of manual labor/shitty tasks dumped on my lap. Whatever, the work flow there was so light it was either do these tasks or be bored. Anyway, it was Portland. My fellow supervisors were huge hipsters, and aggravatingly close-minded about music. There was a CD player in the office, and they would pump Elliot Smith or some other depressing indie stuff constantly. I chose not to use it when anyone else was around - I knew nobody would like my music, so I chose not to subject anyone to it that didn't want to listen. So, the only times I would use it was when I closed and when no one else was there, which was almost every night. So, one night, we have a bunch of extra work to do, and low and behold, it all gets dumped on me. I was the closer, so when anyone had a party or anything to do, they'd dump the extra work on me, because I was going to be there all night anyway, right? Yeah, ok, whatever. I can deal with extra work. So, it's getting fairly late, and the last other supervisor had just gotten changed to go to a party. So she takes off, I'm left alone, and I decide to play some tunes while doing paperwork (NOTE - I don't play music loud. I'm just not comfortable with not being able to hear my surroundings). About an hour later, a different supervisor comes in to get something. They walk right into the office, and straight to the CD player and turn it off. "I don't need to hear this shit," he says. He gets some piece of paper and leaves. He's known to be a dick, so I shrug it off and keep working, turning the music back on once he's left. Then about 30 minutes later, the previous supervisor comes back because she left something there. As soon as she walks in, she walks over to the CD player, turns it off, and just gives a "ugh, gross." She proceeds to make some bitchy remarks about her shitty life, I'm pissed so I don't give a fuck, and I wait until she leaves. That's it. Now, what I wanted to do was piss on all their stuff. I imagined in my mind, of getting one of the large tupperware tubs from the back and fillin' it up with piss, and dumping any personal possession of theirs in it. I didn't though, I feel that probably would have went over-the-line. So, I wasn't just doing paperwork that night. I was doing a lot of manual labor, and I was sweaty as hell. I took all their stupid fucking hipster bullshit CDs, and literally wiped my balls with them. The sweat stains left all over the CDs were disgusting, and fucking hilarious. For the rest of both of their employment there, I giggled every time they picked up one of those CDs up, right before eating a meal on break. Moral of the story: Don't be a fucking dick about music. It's about as meaningful as arguing what everyone's favorite color is.Summary:
Summarize: I have no sympathy for people who complain about Gamestop's buying and selling practices. Nobody is forcing you to sell your games to Gamestop- you could easily do a bit of extra work and sell your games on Craigslist or Amazon or Ebay and make lots more money, but you chose to sell your games to Gamestop because it's easier. And nobody is forcing you to buy your games from Gamestop either- you could get games off Ebay or Amazon or Craigslist for way cheaper and way faster, but if you want it NOW you'll have to go to Gamestop.Summary:
Summarize: I'm currently doing a euro trip with 8 other friends. While we were in Amsterdam one of the girls had her drink spiked and was abducted. It was the most stressful experience of my life. I ended up bursting into tears with my best friend, and yelling out how disgusting the human race can be. Luckily a local got in contact with the abductees and convinced them to let her go. The police were fucking no hope at all.Summary:
Summarize: Hey guys, I don't have anyone to talk to about this and I need to have sense slapped into me. I met a guy (he's 27, full-time career) just about 2 months ago at a small meet-up. It's a bit of a support community. Well, it was obvious we were rather attracted to each other. I caught him staring at me (not at my body) quite a lot, up until I had to leave a bit early and pay my tab at the bar. He was exceptionally polite and super nice. Funny too. He talked to me a lot. Well, I hesitated messaging him because I didn't want to come onto someone I might have to run into if I get rejected. I didn't even know if he was single or not or really interested and happened to be a polite individual. So, two months in (just a week ago, really), I take a risk and message him. He's replying fast on reddit (we all know each other's usernames) through PMs, which I took as a good sign. I give him my number and suggest we meet up sometime. He sends his number my way and says he'll tell me when he's free. I wait a few days, I don't hear anything from him, so I tell him I'm in his part of the town that night and he comes to meet me at a bar. We chat for 4 hours and it's going relatively amazing. I'm giddy not only because he's extremely charming, funny and hella attractive but he feels like one in a million to me. We both left our faith (Islam), come from the same country, extremely similar upbringing, similar views and experiences. I've always been attracted to people of the same ethnic background and I've had troubles finding someone very compatible with the things I'm so strong about -- and I found him through the thing we are both passionate about. So, the date is over. He is adamant about driving me home. I accept his offer. We get to my place and we end up making out, fooling around in his car. I'm feeling giddy about him. I haven't felt this strong and happy attraction to a person in over a year -- that was when my ex broke up with me. Next, he says he'll call me sometime, walks me to the door, says goodbye. The next day, he messages me. We text a little bit and I ask when he's free next. He says maybe Friday but he'll have to get back to me. So, I think, okay, cool. Conversation ends there. The issue(s): I can't stop thinking about whether or not he wants a relationship. a, Maybe he is genuinely busy on Friday, but before he walked me to the door, he mentioned that he was free for the rest of the week. So, now I'm nervous. b, I feel like if we have another meet-up, things will be uncomfortable for me if he is there and things go sour. c, When we were at the bar, he at one point threw in he is "never attached to anything". And then he repeated it twice after. d, He mentioned at the meet-up two months ago that he was set-up for an arranged marriage (a year ago, I believe), which is very popular in our culture. It wasn't terribly strict. They were just sort of set up by their parents and dated. Well, after a short while, he mentioned he was no longer part of the faith and she dumped him. Now, I'm wondering if he's put off by relationships and that's why he said he's "never attached to anything". e, My final reason for worry is that my last serious relationship ended abruptly because of the age gap. My ex was 29 and had a full time career. I'm a university student with a hefty student debt. My ex wanted to get married AND have kids. I was fine with settling down but he wanted someone who could provide the latter. When I type this out, I know how probably how paranoid this sounds, but I'm just so sick of being alone. I miss having a relationship and this guy just seems to be right. Except, I don't even really know now, because of my over-thinking, if he's even into me the same way, wants a relationship or wants to settle down. I'm riddled with over-powering thoughts and when it comes to people who I have dates like these with, I'm used to being chased, not doing the chasing. So, this is all new to me.Summary:
Summarize: Six months ago I started using YNAB. My wife was skeptical at first, or really more dismissive. It was the third finance software I had moved us to in a year and half. We took the classes together, and I installed the app on our phones. In December I finally sold her on the power of YNAB. There was nearly a visible shift in the way that she looked at spending and in YNAB. I know most people here talking about their sixth month on YNAB would link a screenshot of their net worth or talk about how they've paid off a ton of debt since starting. We're not there yet, but it is obvious to me that we've already made the most important change with YNAB. You see, back when we were being stupid and not tracking anything, we'd stop spending when AMEX started getting declined and start back up again when we capitalized that debt somewhere else. Then we stared using Mint and we would stop spending when the balance on our checking account got too low. An improvement to be sure, but we were still treading water. The power of YNAB is that now we stop spending when the budget balance in the relevant category is gone. We have made that cultural shift. When you're able to start doing that, that's the difference that will bring about the rest of the successes. The other day my wife told me to stop off at Costco on the way home and buy a big bag of pretzels. At the time I though this was weird because usually she loads me up with bunch of things if I'm going to stop off at a store. After I paid for the pretzels I went to enter the transaction in the app on my phone and I realized why she wanted me to only buy the pretzels. We had $6.42 left in the Groceries category and the pretzels cost $5.87. She knew exactly what we had left and stopped. We didn't raid the buffer we're building, or any of the other Rule 2 categories that we're working on. We stopped spending.Summary:
Summarize: Yep, I do. Maybe not to the extent that OP described, or at least not all the time (though that's assuming OP does this all the time). It goes hand in hand with one of the most important lessons I've learned concerning relationships of any type: most (not all) people don't want to be right, they want to think they're right. I'm not doing them a favor by correcting a incorrect fact or grammar mistake ^ , I'm the asshole that made them feel dumb so I can feel better about myself. While that's not the case, it's likely how they feel about the situation. When I know more about a topic someone's excited to talk to me about (or when I'm familiar with every single topic they ever bring up) the person could feel like I'm trying to one-up them all the time. I'm not the guy who is interested in the same topic as them, I'm the asshole who is always politely telling them "I already knew that." By letting people be wrong and sharing exciting "new" things with me it allows us to get to know each other better. Without those steps it's very likely my good intentions will make me out to be a dick. As people get to know me better these rules of interaction go away slowly.Summary:
Summarize: I saw the second one recently and was extremely disappointed, I skipped through some of it because the dialogue was just so so bad, I understand that it's a kind of mick take of action films, but pretty much most lines are cliché 'action film dialogue'. And some of the throw backs to previous films are down right fucking terrible, one that comes to mind is when Arnie states for the 100th time- 'I'll be back', Bruce Willis retorts 'you've been back enough, I'll be back '- that's not too awful, but then Arnie follows it with something ridiculous like 'yeesh yippee ki yay'. I was just shocked at how far it fell from the first one which had some genuinely entertaining dialogue moments- as well as a more interesting story.Summary:
Summarize: Have an extra room available for next year? Want to fill it with a pretty awesome dude? Then I'm your man! I'm a second year Aerospace Engineering student looking for some people to live with next year! Some stuff about me: I lived in PCV this year, but have come to the conclusion that it kinda sucks ass, and I want to live in a house next year! Super Important fact one: I love cooking. I can make a mean grapefruit teriyaki chicken stir fry. Not your thing? Thats okay, I can make you some bomb pasta casserole or maybe some awesome marinated steaks! I also like video games, any type! Want someone to stroll through the glorious land of skyrim with? Or shoot some noobs on BF3? I'm down! Want a roommate who isn't loud and obnoxious so you can get your work done? Perfect! I can even help you with your math homework! Well, unless your a math major. Then I might not be so much help. That all probably made me sound like a lazy nerd. Not true! (Well, at least not the lazy part). I love going to the gym and running! We can even go backpacking and rock climbing! I love that shit! Some big stuff I can bring: kick ass sound system. Like ridiculous level. We can listen to some sick dubstep and techno on it. Classic rock is good too. I'll bring a xbox, desktop computer, laptop, wireless router, and a bunch of kitchen stuff. Oh, also really important: I'm not a slob. I do my dishes right after I make them. I clean things up, and wont make a mess. I don't mess with other people's stuff either. If it's not mine, I won't touch it. Send me a message, or email me at osnofla9@gmail.com. I can send you my fb and we can meet up sometime!Summary:
Summarize: I was driving a commercial truck in NJ. Some dick was ass-hurt by my merging onto the highway at 50 MPH in a 55 MPH zone. (What can I say, it was a really slow truck.) The dick was doing 75 in the slow lane. He waited until the last second to slam on his brakes and honk his horn at me. And then, all road rage style, zoomed around me, cut me off and slammed the brakes. So I, of course, slowed down and changed lanes. He cuts me off again and hits the brakes. Again I slowed down and changed lanes. He does it again. The 4th time he does this I don't slow down, remain at my top speed of 62 MPH (slow ass truck!). He comes within 3 feet of my front bumper. I signal to bring it on, macho style, with a wave of my hand. Fully calling his bluff, and having gotten my message across that I was not slowing down again and an accident was OK with me, he flips me the bird and zooms off. Wish I had an iPhone back then...Summary:
Summarize: I know what you mean. The last thing I want to do while driving is listen to shitty music on the radio. I don't want to wade in amongst the adds, radio "personalities", and teeny-bopper bullshit that passes as mainstream music these days, praying that the next song that receives airtime, just before I arrive at my destination, is something that I'll like. The main complaints in this thread is how people don't like the music being played by JJJ at the moment and how it was better when they played music you liked. WELL GO FUCK YOURSELF. If there is a certain type of music you like listening to, then go buy/download the albums of your favourite band and stop crying about it. In this day and age when everyone seems to have a device that'll play an mp3, I have no idea why you would bother with the radio. Hate the presenters? Go download a podcast. Hate Aussie Hip Hop? Download the music you actually like. It's not rocket surgery; it's common-fucking-sense.Summary:
Summarize: So last weekend, me and my friend decided to get together to smoke a few bowls. At the end of the night she gave me her grinder and everything in it ( I believe she is trying to quit.)At around 2:00 AM I dropped her off at her house and was on my way back to my own when I notice there's a cop right on my ass, I was sketched out as fuck, but luckily i'm a decent high driver. I turn this last corner onto the road my house is on, and lo and behold his lights come on. At this point i'm thinking " Oh fuck, i'm fucked." I take at least 2 minutes to find a decent place to pull over, sketching out because there is a grinder full of weed in one of my cup holders and a capsule with a few grams inside. He comes over to my window, asks how i'm doing, then ask me if I knew why I was pulled over. "I have no clue." I said playing it cool. "Your registration is expired." I was so relieved. NOW! This is where you could probably tell something was wrong with me. He asks me for my license and registration, so I grab my registration without missing a beat...But... I pull out my wallet, grabbed a card and held it out to him. "your ID please" He said, I was confused. I was holding out my fucking debit card. He asked me if I had anything to drink, I said "Nope." I drove back home and he followed me the rest of the way there. I'm registered now, lets hope this doesn't happen again.Summary:
Summarize: I'm with a great guy and we've been together about a year. I haven't been this happy with someone in a very long time. We gel. But he.. does things. He might say something painfully insensitive, or leave his underwear on the floor in the bathroom, or spit nasty loogies (is there even a correct spelling for this?) in my sink. I'm fairly passive and don't like conflict by nature, so I when I feel myself boiling over, I retreat and then bring it up jokingly days later when I've relaxed in a "oh ha remember that one time when I was pissed the f off at __ ?.. oh you didn't know?" kind of way. Those days inbetween are killer though, because I'm a nightmare where I'm mad but I won't say why. Mostly because I just don't have the language to express it.Summary:
Summarize: First off, i'm sorry for the length... My story starts about a year ago. I was working ALOT and started having trouble with the wife. I was addicted to porn then and knew it, but didn't have the will power to work 16hr days and try to break the addiction. My wife had been slowly losing interest in me because I wasn't spending any time with her and when I did I was a cranky jerkass! So eventually the S hit the fan and my relationship with my best friend was in some serious jeopardy. We had some massive fights and I broke, because she was the most important thing in my life and she had damn near slipped away. I fell into a depression and hated life. I was angry at my wife for many things and i was so full of pride. I moved into a separate bedroom and been there ever since. Then things turned around. My uncle called me and spent time to teach me the ways of Jesus. I had been raised a christian, but I had not been raised to love others more than myself. I was christian by name and not by action. I'm trying to change that. So fast forward to a couple months ago where I find this reddit. I had been taking steps to improve myself and be more christ-like. I wanted to win my wife back and really show her that I loved her. I also wanted to break from my slavery to porn. As the bible says, you can't serve two masters. I started out doing about 2-3 days, then moved to a week. After that i've gone about 2-7 days in spurts and have really struggled. Every day is a struggle for me but this reddit has really helped encourage and push me on. I haven't met my goal of 2 weeks but I will!!! I had read all the stories about how nofap made single guys ask out the girl. Well, for me, it made me humble myself and ask to move back into the bedroom with my wife. Not to have sex, but to have her help keep me accountable at night. I only fap when i'm alone. I try to spend more time with her so that i'm not alone. All the anger and resentment I had from our fights has started slipping away and i've been able to start showing her the love that christ has shown me. well, today during my quite time I broke into tears. she came in and asked me what was wrong and I confessed for the first time that i have a bad addiction to porn. She knew i was trying to go without fapping, but I don't think she really understood why. Today I told her about the addiction that i'm under and that i am sorry for all the wrong i've done her. so, /r/nofap/ thank you. thank you for helping me come out about this addiction and thank you for helping me take steps to fix it. christian or not, thank you for helping me start to show the love my wife deserves.Summary:
Summarize: I agree with adding some more depth than that. Getting some of this drama in is fine. But I feel they have lost sight of what made Suits Suits. I think it's good they dont stick to the same pattern, it makes show become boring (look at House M.D. 80% of most episodes were pretty much the exact same build-up, despite being awesome, it got pretty annoying). But this shit's getting old, and it's only gonna get worse, I think. I'm certain Mike will break up after Rachel tells him (next ep probably), and after that Mikes probably gonna end up in some miserable slump. Maybe starts smoking weed again or something, to underline the obvious rockbottom he's hit. Rachel's probably gonna seek council with Donna, who will advise her to "give him some time" or something like that. And I think they will drag this "will they get back together or won't they?" on for a longer while than needed. And they might even decide to make it worse, because collusion happens with two people. Why not also force Harvey to patch up the broken Mike because Cahill is riding their ass with his personal vendetta, and he can't have Mike being an easy way into his bussiness in his current state.Summary:
Summarize: Below is a copy of [this post]( by /u/2095conash on Sun Sep 21 21:16:05 2014 UTC, as read on Sun Sep 21 21:16:24 2014 UTC. I've seen various times people talk about how the men's rights movement is against equality due to them not understanding what we're saying. Obviously there are a bunch of people that straw-man us, or refuse to listen to us, but there's nothing that we can do about that. What we can do however is choose our words so that we don't confuse people who DO take the time to listen to us to prevent them from thinking that we believe that the random equality supporting person who identifies as a feminist, no matter how misguided they may be, are the people we, as a movement, fight. One of the biggest problems that we have with arguing against feminism is if you would, people 'pull out' the dictionary, whether this tactic is logically valid or not doesn't change that it gets to the core of one of our biggest misunderstandings, what WE mean when we say 'feminism' is MUCH different than what most people mean when they say feminism. It doesn't matter which is 'right' because with this big communication gap we can't even BEGIN to discuss who is right. It's like, if we assume all apples are red, if they believe that 'purple' means red (so they think apples are purple), and we believe that 'green' means red (so we think apples are green), we argue that green is the best color in the world, they argue that purple is the best color in the world, but because we aren't communicating properly it isn't revealed that we're BOTH saying that red is the best color. I recognize how the metaphor does not mirror this situation, it was merely to demonstrate the difficulties that arise from two parties that don't understand what the other is saying due to a lack of communication. Now, we can't really expect them to start clarifying their statements since one of the reasons for our general conflict with 'feminists' (as individuals) is because both sides generally write away the other side's definition as something that doesn't matter. From what I've seen, they do it because they think that ours isn't real, it's wrong, or whatever, and we do it because 100 people sitting around at computers talking about how equality is good don't matter even 1/10th as much as someone getting an anti-equality law passed. So if we want to be able to communicate and be better understood, the burden is on us really as the side the acknowledges both definitions. Now, I recognize that we have used terms like 'radical feminist', but I don't think that is clear enough, because that suggests that some teenage girl who wants to kill all men who no one listens to is who we're upset about, rather than someone who is heard and talks about how men shouldn't hit women (instead of people shouldn't hit people, which does include men shouldn't hit women so such a discussion isn't anti-equality but is misguided). I personally think that we should start using terms LIKE (feel free to suggest alternatives) 'ideological feminist' and 'movement feminist'. In this we'd be against 'movement feminists' or 'movement feminism', the people who have and use the power of the movement, the money of the movement, the image of the movement, or such. While 'ideological' feminists would be more of the type who have opinions, and maybe they talk about them, but they aren't really 'big', they don't have a 'wide scale' effect (while masses of ideologicals DO have a 'wide impact' on the image, money, or other resources of the movement, I generally feel that those are the sorta things that every individual of every movement contributes a tiny percent of those merely by having the label). I know that there are many of you here who are of the belief that feminism is built upon inherently sexist beliefs, so don't think that I'm saying that all ideological feminists are pro-equality but recognizing there are a lot of moderate ideological feminists is something that we can do to have people listen to us about the radical movement feminists, and at the end of the day, it's those radical movement feminists that lead to children having 'the glass ceiling', 'the pay gap', and all sorts of those things beaten into them with no alternate view. The major problem when our only clarifying terms are 'radical' and 'moderate' are that the moderates think the radicals are only ideological feminists, when a disproportionate amount of movement feminists are radical. Obviously you can further clarify by using both radical/moderate and ideological/movement together, but I recognize that's a bit of a slippery slope to much longer identifiers.... But those are just my thoughts, what do you all think? Anyone have any better suggestions for the terms? Any arguments against 'clarifying' what we're saying by adding one or two words here and there? I apologize for my verbose nature and if any of you feel this thread to have been a waste of your time. I thank you very much for your time and hope you have a nice day!Summary:
Summarize: I had spinal surgery last week. I had a follow up appointment today with my neurosurgeon and asked him about the surgery. In his opinion, Tiger will never be the same. A golf swing - especially how Tiger swings - is violent. I was told not to golf for 3 months (my surgery was a little more intense than Tiger's) and I don't swing the club a thousand times a week or with even close to the power he does.Summary:
Summarize: Please see OP: > We're both liberal free-thinkers. We freely talk about how we'd be okay with each other engaging in honest and responsible play with other people, as long as we're open about it with each other and communicate to any third parties that we are each other's primary partners. Which means yes, I'd be okay with things if "it was the other way around." Actually, there's a part of me that wishes she did have an especially difficult or unusual desire (or wanted sex elsewhere enough to request it), so that I'd have the opportunity to both prove in me the kind of selfless devotion deepthroating sometimes requires (which I am, after all, asking of her), as well as having an arena in which to shed some of my guilt about feeling like I'm requesting more than I'm able to give. For exactly that reason I've offered on many occasions to take up sexual practices with her that she would like but might make me uncomfortable, but which I would gladly work toward overcoming if she wanted them, e.g. earning my "redwings" (cunnilingus during period), anilingus, giving or receiving golden showers, even bloodplay. But we're open about which kinks get us off and which don't, and while there's a large overlap, there is also this desire of mine for deepthroat (which she even likes but can't perform). So far she seems not to have an additional kink I don't happily satisfy. And another thing: > So, as long as she lets other women swallow your knob, you won't consider it a dealbreaker. I think I have that right? You may think you have that right, but you'd be wrong. I've said, "So far [playing with others] remains only talk between us, but more and more I find myself wanting to look elsewhere for this thing I feel I need that I'm not getting at home." "Looking elsewhere" by no means indicates a willingness to terminate my relationship with my girlfriend, as I feel I've made clear more than once now. We've long considered opening our relationship in various ways, while remaining committed to each other as primary partners. My statement is not so much a threat, as your reading of it would seem to suggest, but a confession--I feel bad that it's the case that more and more I'm imagining getting my sexual needs met elsewhere, but it is the truth. I am feeling that way. I would much rather not resort to such things, which is one of the main reasons why I'm asking for advice in the first place.Summary:

Summarize: I've know a few people who this happened too. Their family disowned them and completely broke contact, one kid hadn't seen or herd form any relative for 7 years. I met most of them when I was in college and every signal one of them were fucked up. They were all horrible people that were well on their way to being sociopaths. Their empathy for others feelings where gone or was ignored, even purposely hurt. When they learned that nobody in their family truly loved them and were just broken and now permanently angry at the world. The worst were the ones who joined the military to ensure that they could never act on their "urges".Summary:

Summarize: I've been depressed my entire life, and I'm currently in a very shit spot where everything is joyless and I don't give a fuck about anything. I wrote a longer post about things here: Normally I stay awake half the night with anxiety and other thoughts/worries, but now I haven't slept at all for two days. This is the second day I've taken off work without calling in, and I'm trying to get myself back to the point of going in and facing the music. I don't care if I get canned or not, but I realize that doing so would be bad for me and the people I work with (primarily my dad). I've been coping by using alcohol for years, and I'm seriously concerned it's going to kill me. Since the beginning of the year I've been getting drunk almost every night and it's butchering my bank account. However, it's the only thing (other than drugs) that lets me feel other emotions and gives me a way to not give a fuck about everything I'm procrastinating on. It lets me feel numb about how I'm letting myself and everyone else down. I need other alternatives. I've seen a counselor but talking hasn't really helped, and the last antidepressant I was on was Effexor which did nothing, even though the side/withdrawal effects were totally fucked. I can identify self-defeating or self-destructive behaviour, but I having serious problems stopping or preventing it. I don't want to die. What else can I do?Summary:
Summarize: My girlfriend[19F] of a year and a half broke up with me[18M] after three months of long distance summer relationship. It wasn't because I was a bad bf or anything, it's because she fell in love with her best friend[18F]. We never had sex and for about 8 months before the break up we had no time to fit any intimate interactions into our schedule (ex: foreplay, oral..) We did however go on dates and she always was amazingly happy after the dates. I'm part of their friend group and I still talk to my ex since we were amazing friends and still have similar interests. Just yesterday, she wanted to talk to me about the sex she's having with her new girlfriend and possibly tips to make them comfortable since I was so great with foreplay(when we actually did it) and a lot of lesbian sex is foreplay. This not only made me uncomfortable but jealous af. How is it fair that we were together for more than a year and never had sex but they've been together for a month and they do it everyday(they live together btw so woo jealously). I gave her all the tips but I just feel so sexually frustrated and horny af When she said she really wanted to see me(before break up) I thought we were going to do some intimate stuff. No one was home, she just got back from her long distance trip and I was ready to get down(even if it was just going to be foreplay and oral). Instead she broke up with me and I'm bursting with sexual frustration. Masterbation isn't working because all I think of is her. I can't seem to cum without thinking about her and that really fucks up my mind since we're broken up. I've been trying to talk to other girls and get out but I just can't connect with someone the way I did with her. I started lifting and eating healthier too to try to let out some of that frustration but I'm finding it to be even stronger than before What are some ways to keep my mind off her when I masterbate? ways to release sexually frustration?Summary:
Summarize: There was a house fire in a town near me and they were doing a television appeal for the family involved. They did the interview outside the front of the house (the house only partially burned, the garage segment to the side was mostly untouched). This family is looking all cut and then the reporter/interviewer asks "Is there anything that you would really like someone to donate, something that would make your day?". This woman responds "We'd love some bikes for the kids. The three of them have lost everything and bikes would just be something to play with, something for them to own again". Fair enough right? Except for the fact the people hauling goods out of the unburned garage were taking the untouched perfectly fine bikes outside ON CAMERA! I counted 3 bikes leaving that garage and all of them didn't have a scratch. She obviously thought bikes would have good resale value or something.Summary:
Summarize: The original post is [here!]( I'm going to go into a bit more detail here because my first post was a bit vague and because I also need an outlet to write down my thoughts. My girlfriend and I met last fall when I returned home from a 2 month Euro trip. I took this trip preceding beginning my career and a few months after a bad relationship ended. I went to simply travel, work on myself, and do something crazy essentially before settling down to work. From here on out I'll call her Mary to avoid confusion. Upon returning home I was crashing on my friends couch at his college apartment since it is close to my work. Mary is still in college finishing up her last year. We met through mutual friends one night and from that moment were inseparable. We casually saw each other for about a month before we made this official. Our relationship was really, really incredible. Awesome chemistry, never bickered, and genuinely enjoyed each other's company. All our friends were friends so we were able to spend a lot of time together with them and alone. A month or two into our relationship she wanted to talk to tell me about her past. About a year ago Mary was involved in an accident. A drunk driver on a motorcycle lost control and slid under her car. She ran him over, killing him on impact. Mary fell into a depression of sorts and her boyfriend of 3 years broke up with her shortly after the incident. From this point on she has had difficulty dealing with her emotions and controlling them. Sometimes they are all over the place, sometimes non-existent. Due to school and playing soccer for University she never had that much time to recover and take time to herself. When she told me this I was shocked. I listened and comforted her. We talked on longer I made it clear that while I can't relate, I have had some significant emotional trauma in my past so I am always available to talk. Flash forward to about weeks ago. We had another great weekend together and she tells me that she has fallen very hard for me. The next weekend is her formal for soccer and we are both excited for a fun night together. And this is the night everything changed. We both got quite drunk and she got extremely upset. She said she is getting scared and that she is worried I don't like her, that she is not sure she is ready for a relationship and this is all moving too fast. The next few days were torture. We went from this perfect relationship where for the first time in my life I felt like things were going right, I felt like I had a real purpose. To a shattered romance with everything up in the air. We talked on 4 days after and I put everything on the line. I told her how much I cared about her, that this relationship is still young and we can slow things down. We agreed not to break up, but to spend less time together to allow her to have some alone time and focus on school. The next day we spent spent together since it was a snow day and it was just like nothing had ever happened. We laughed until our sides hurt, cuddled, and spent the night together. The next two days I could tell something was wrong. This past Sunday we talked again and she said she is just not ready for a relationship right now. She wanted this so badly, but feels that something is missing right now between us for her. It is nothing I have done, it is nothing that I'm not doing. She is extremely upset because what we do have is great, but it just isn't the right time for us. I've taken this extremely hard. While I had been holding my emotions together, on this day and this talk I broke down to her when I realized it was over for now. I didn't beg or plead or anything of that sort. I simply just cried while she comforted me. I told her that I do want what is best for her and if being alone right now is what she wants then who am I to deny her that. We cannot force something to make it work it has to be organic. I told her I needed 2 weeks of no contact to straighten myself out. Since she walked out the door 2 days ago we have not had any contact. I'm doing alright, the mornings are the worst when I wake up and for a brief moment my mind is still believing we are together. But, it always sets in after a minute or so, crushing even more than last time. I do think that I was more ready for a serious relationship than her. I graduated university, traveled a lot, and now have a career. She is still finding her path in life and trying to figure out what she wants to do. I think this scared her on top of a relationship. While I told her that we won't talk for 2 weeks I intend on not talking for as long as I can last. I will check in after the 2 weeks because I said I would, but after that I'm going to cut contact without telling her. I need to not have her around right now to let myself heal and grow from this. Also, it is best for her to not have me around at the moment. My thinking is that by moving on from this we both have the ability to continue our lives and not be weighed down by this. However, it is also in the back of my head that if she begins to have to live a life without me at all it will reveal her true feelings about me. Maybe after a few months she will realize this is what she wants. While I know it is frowned upon to go back and try things again I can't lie to you all, because this is what I want. I know right now my emotions are raw, but there was seriously a magic between us. And if she doesn't come back after me cutting her out of my life then at least I have been moving towards not having her in mine. So! My question or advice I'm looking for is does this make sense? Love is not black and white and there are no set rules for everyone. There are exceptions to everything and I truly believe that one day there will be a time for us. I don't intend to wait around. I want to improve myself while she has her time to do whatever it is she needs to do. But does cutting contact really work? Long run if we don't work out I would still like to have her in my life. Sorry for this long story but I'm just in a dark place at the moment. Sometimes I feel men don't have a support network to talk about these things as much as I love my friends and family. Even if no one helps me or offers advice thanks for being an outlet for me to talk.Summary:
Summarize: Being depressed is a really awful thing. You shut down and stop being so outgoing. If you're already an introvert people don't notice what has happened because its a series of really small changes to your lifestyle. But that's the key. No one notices. And that nasty little voice starts echoing in the back of your mind and you recognize it. But by now you're trapped. you've forgotten how to live without depression and you begin sabotaging your own attempts to beat it. Your failures are the only thing that echo in your mind. "You're worthless" you tell yourself, "You can't succeed at anything." Your hobbies and passions lose their luster and stop being enjoyable. You're filled with despair and crippling sense of loss and defeat with no way out.Summary:
Summarize: im working on an intentionally stupid cube with all the morph creatures, multiplayer matters cards from commander and conspiracy sets and 'un' non-creature spells. My question isn't whether this will be good (because I know it won't be) but rather how would people go around drafting a 360 card cube with usually 4-5 people, to play one multiplayer game? Do you draft the whole thing even if it takes ages or just miss some random cards out. I want to make it 360 because I want the option to draft with & and have two multiplayer games split off and also because of how many morph creatures there are (around 177 actually). Any answers and advice on the questions would be great fully received!Summary:

Summarize: Forget the reality of Batman for a moment, like the amount of training he needs to take to become that physically athletic or the impossible achievements that is needed to become Batman, or how one man is like an entire army against the entire crime underworld in the city of Gotham that is based of the city of Chicago …. I am talking about his methods of intimidation and inducing-fear into his enemies. Don't get me wrong, I love that about Batman and he is one of my most favourite comic book heroes of all time and somehow quite understandable, considering the plenty of mob bosses and feared criminal leaders have had Gotham at their fingertips for far too long and have been ruling it through terror, corruption and even chaos, so it is very reasonable and thoughtful process for Bruce Wayne for challenge Gotham's criminal underworld the same way that criminals do .... fear. So that all criminals would know that they are not in charge anymore and get a taste of their own medicine and fear is a very powerful emotion. It is an emotion that gives you great wisdom when there is danger around. That is why people become hesitant when they see an angry tiger looking at them dead in the eye like it is ready to pounce with its fangs and teeth ready and exposed, same for Batman when he is hiding in the shadows, looking like a demonic beast, who just came from hell to punish them for their sins. So, I am wondering ... will Batman's methods actually work? I am a psychology student, and we have come across a psychological phenomenon called fear-arousal appeal, which is a strategy for motivating people to take a particular action, endorse a particular policy, or buy a particular product, by arousing fear. This develops a lot of many media, mostly on television. But there is a catch, too much fear will cause too much anxiety to the person and they will often avoid that phenomenon, or in worst cases, it will give them so much anxiety because they will soon believe that what that induced fear is telling them, like you are worthless, or you are weak, and so on. And this has been done a lot in the past and failed miserably. That strategy often backfires and instead of making the people not stop that behaviour that the message was intending to portray, they actually do it more (Like a parent is always criticising about anything that the kid does and scold them, to the point that turns into abuse, but anyway) Too much fear will actually be too anxious and too harmful and studies have suggested that people are more likely to continue to behave in their delinquent acts Plus, we know that people don't actually engage in criminal acts by choice. Those who are criminals are people who have gone through tough challenges in life like poor environments, poor social support, low socio-economic status and so on. So, no one does these "evil acts" by choice. (which is somehow a good reason why I like Batman so much because there is a good reason why Batman refuses to kill and rather sends them to justice and focuses a lot on funding for the mentally ill and orphanages and for the poor because he knows that his enemies are not so different than he is because they were more than victims of unfortunate circumstances, just like he was, so he will willing to bring them justice but also willing to give them a second chance in life, over and over again.)Summary:

Summarize: I'll share my story: I was sitting at a stop light just kinda zoned out because the light was red, and out of nowhere this guy just slams into the back of my car and everything inside just flew everywhere. I'm still trying to figure out what happened and I looked back and just instantly got pissed. I throw my door open and scream "WHAT THE FUCK!!" And the guy's just like "bro I'm so sorry..." And gets In his car and backs out so I get into mine and he pulls next to me saying to meet at the gestation right ahead. He's in front of me, and as I'm slowing down to turn, he just floors it and takes off. I have no idea how the hell his car is driving still, let alone hauling balls because there is so much radiator fluid and smoke just coming out of his car it's unbelievable. So he takes off, and I look at my friend in the assigner seat like "what the fuck do I do?" So I gun it, and tell him to call the cops. I'm going 90 in a 55 on the frontage road and this lady catches up to me king if that guy hit me. I say yes, and she takes off. I am at no point of catching him so I turn around tell a cop to meet me at a Walmart near for a report. We get everything done and he tells me that six people called in my accident saying everything that happened and the lady who started following him got his plate number. So I leave and the cop calls me about ten minutes later saying the guy got 20 miles away and hit a different car and fled, then gets pulled over because his car is fucked and it turns out, he's got a warrant out already and two more from that so he got arrested within an hour of it happening.Summary:
Summarize: Hey man, throwaway here but I have some advice. As you can see from my account name, I suffer from cumming WAY too quickly. Well, I used to suffer. Here's what I've been able to do to get over my PE: Go as slow as possible. No reason to plow head-first into sex at full speed. Take your time, if you feel the need to cum, pull out and focus on NOT finishing. It might take some practice, but try as hard as you can. Once that feeling goes away, you may reenter. That feeling might come back almost immediately, just rinse and repeat until you no longer feel the need to cum. Usually this whole stop and go thing takes a minute or two until I'm able to go on for quite some time. I've gone from lasting literally 5 seconds to 20+ minutes using this method. If your girlfriend is as understanding as mine, she won't have any problems with the initial stop and go portion of sex seeing as she'll be getting good sex a few minutes later.Summary:

Summarize: Okay so my friend and I are going to go to his house this weekend to smoke. We did this 3 weeks ago and it worked fine. However this weekend another friend will be joining us so that makes 3. This is where it gets interesting, a while back, like last summer, I was at this same friend's house, we'll call him Larry, any way like 7 people were there and everyone got high except me. Fast forward the next day, my mom looks through my texts and finds out everyone got high, I get drug tested and of course pass because I didn't smoke. She eventually let me start hanging out with them again. She is 100% cool with Larry but I'm afraid that because this weekend there is more than just me and Larry she'll get hella suspicious and drug test me when I get home, (She has hella drug tests stocked up because my brother was a 'bad' kid lol) so, what should I do? I really want to smoke but my parent's trust me a lot and if they were to find out they'd be really disappointed in me, I'd lose their trust, and I'd feel really bad about myself. So I'm not sure if I'm just over reacting or not.Summary:
Summarize: _- I live a normal life and have the same beliefs of any other muslim. So I was right about generalizing. You admit that your argument was bullshit and your downvotes unjustified. > Second, you are still trying to stereotype muslims as murderers No, nobody here even remotely did that. That's a straw man. Good job proving how fulll of shit you are and everyone supporting your position. >Mohammad (peace be with him) would not approve of any of the current day extremists that exist. No true scotsman. Hey, guess what: Other people think Mohammad would not approve of your shitty face and cut your head off. And considering Islam's history that is the more realistic assumption considering Mohammad was a child-fucking warlord that ordered people's death throughout his life. And no, that is not a biased and unfair interpretation that's literally what he was and you can read it in your little holy book. It's sad that you are delusional enough to ignore all the shitty parts of your religion. But guess what: If you don't believe fully in the Quran you are not a Muslim. Quite obviously you disagree with what's written in the Quran, so why call yourself Muslim? You are simply not. I'm pretty sure many of the things you do are contradicting the Quran. For example: Do you treat women as equals? Because the Quran tells you not to. The Quran explicitly and undeniably tells you to command them and hit them if they disobey you. > If you want to talk about Muslims learn something about them that isn't in the news, and isn't a biased, anti-religion source. You mean the Quran? You mean history? >That is where you will get the correct information, and not contorted, taken out of context quotes. I think you are the one who has incorrect and distorted information. You are the one cherrypicking. If you actually thought critically about your religion you would abandon it because it's vile filth. It's sad that non-Muslims often are more informed about Islam than Muslims. Usually because they actually figured out that it's bullshit and therefore choose never to become Muslims.Summary:
Summarize: No, you're totally ready! We've all been there and we all made it out alive. You can too! When I was getting ready to graduate college, I developed a strategy that has been highly useful in so many things. I'm a big list person, so if you like lists (and crossing shit off of lists like a motherfucker) then this will work well for you. Write down the thing you want to happen. (E.G. "Rent an apartment") Take this ONE thing (don't let your other worries invade at the moment) and figure out what all needs to happen. Write down each individual task that needs to happen. It's super super important that every item on this list is an action that can be accomplished. As a bonus, make the list very specific so it keeps you on task and lets you cross lots of stuff off. If the list in step 2 is not prioritized, do that now. Rewrite the list in order of importance or the order in which things need to get done. Make a plan for doing the items on your list. Most things don't get completed in one day. Break your list into multiple days and make sure that you are always making progress. Get to work! You've totally spec-ed out your work, and now the only thing left to do is to get that shit done. I promise this method (if you apply it to your personality and lifestyle) will work. If you adjust appropriately, you can even use this methodology to answer the hard questions of life, like "what kind of job should I get," "do I really want to move that far away," "what do I do with my college degree," "should I be dating that person." I've used this method to: Quit a job Talk with people on the phone (I'm still working on not being nervous when I call people...) Apply to grad school Take exams / write massive papers Rent an apartment Buy appliances Get my utilities set up for the first time Not let my dreams get demolished after getting denied on a mortgage Buy a goddamned house (even after my loan was denied) We are so lucky to live in this era. You know why? Because there are billions of people who have gone through similar situations and have had the same questions... and we all bring our questions to the same place: the internet. If you have a question you pull up Google and ask away... I guarantee someone has had your question before.Summary:
Summarize: Your story is very similar to mine. I've had a forced feminization fetish for as long as I can remember, and it ramped up due to continual porn and masturbation over the years. For the longest time I was fine with it: being a shy kid with no romantic prospects, it was how I got off, so although it was odd, I just went with it. Once I started breaking out of my shell and pursuing relationships, I realized that this fetish had basically warped my brain and made normal relationships with girls really difficult. While I've gotten better with girls, I've developed ED and general sexual frustration, which has been very painful to face. I strongly believe that my reliance on my fetish, in addition to inexperience, has made it so that I can't function normally in "vanilla" sex, which is something I desperately want. I saw a sex therapist who definitely helped me deal with unfounded shame and guilt I felt about the fetish. But throughout this time, I've still felt that as much as I "enjoy" the fetish in terms of getting me off, I really have no desire to enact these fantasies in real life. I want to get off based off love, not humiliation. And I want healthy sex with girls, not with my hand in front of a computer. I've been trying NoFap for about a year, with my top streak at 52 days, and I'm determined to get 90 days and beyond. Among the goals I have is to weaken or maybe even eliminate my fetish. I don't know if a successful 90+ day reboot will do the trick, but at the very least I'm trying, and perhaps I can gain sensitivity to normal, fulfilling sex with girls without the fetish. I'm not sure what advice I can give you about informing your girlfriend, as I've grappled with the same kind of thing. I haven't told people in my day-to-day life about my fetish, although if a lasting relationship comes along, I'm sure I'll need to address it. In the meantime, best I can advise is keep at NoFap, try a successful reboot, and see how you feel about your fetishes afterwards once you've cleared out some of the cobwebs in your brain. This MUST include refraining from looking at porn, even if you aren't masturbating to it! That's certainly what I'm trying (and you're two weeks ahead of me!)Summary:
Summarize: Age: 33 Sex: M Height: 1.9 meters Weight: 102 kg Race: White Duration of complaint: approximately 2 years, 4 months Current medications: Topiramate (migraines), Elavil (migraines) Past Medications: Ultram (back), Amrix (back), Steroid Injections (spine) Health Leading Up To Issues: Prior to problems, athletic lifestyle. I typically did two separate two-hour workouts a day (morning/evening). Participated in regular half marathons, avid swimmer, mountain running, basketball, calisthenics/bodyweight exercise. Was about 10kg lighter. Career Related Issues: Profession requires rotating shift work. Work is sedentary, not moving or standing. Summary of Events Since Issues Began (sorry if this jumps around a little) : Special, one-time project at work took me to remote location with bunk houses for about four months. Beds were small and uncomfortable for my larger frame. During my time at the work site, free time activities were limited so my normal daily activity level was reduced significantly (to approx. ~1/4th time) to a 4 to 6 km moderate to low pace (5:20-5:35 min/km) run, and maybe 15-20 minutes of push-ups, air squats, pull-ups, etc. I did not feel as if I was pushing myself, quite the opposite -- felt very inactive and restless. I was not sleeping well at all because I did not feel tired at the end of the day. Towards the end of work assignment, my upper back started getting sore. After about one week of soreness and reducing to just a light jog during this time, I woke up with a sharp/shooting pain going down the right side of my back and right arm. My arm felt fully numb as if I had slept on it awkwardly. Based on anecdotal evidence, I have generally had a high tolerance to pain for most of my life, but this was unlike anything I've felt before and unbearable. After making it out of the bunkhouse, I immediately told the supervisor that I could not perform my duties that day and I needed to seek medical attention. With a years of history at my company of never missing a day due to illness, or even as much as being a couple minutes late for anything, the supervisor immediately took me to a medical facility. The first physician told me that he believed I had strained a muscle in my upper back and possibly pinched or agitated a nerve in the process. I was given prescription for muscle relaxers, instructed to take over the counter anti-inflammatory medicine, also to limit my activity to not aggravate the area, and finally to follow up with my physician at home. After the first few days of sleeping like I was dead on the muscle relaxers and constant anti-inflammatory pills, the shooting pains became intermittent with random instances of my entire arm from shoulder down going numb. After returning home, my physician sent me to physical therapy at first which offered no lasting relief despite strictly adhering to the given exercise regiment and making all appointments for TENs sessions and various other therapy methods they used. I was also told to have an MRI completed. The sharp/shooting pains continued daily, but would have multiple day periods where they would flare up to original levels that were near incapacitating and a typical period. The results of the MRI showed that I had a disc in my neck that is bulging but not herniated. ( Fast forward: Over the last 2+ years I have spoken to five different physicians, mixture of general practice and spine specialists, that all agree it does not appear to be enough to warrant any attempt at corrective surgery at this time based on initial and two followup MRI tests. ) I was referred to get steroid injections in my neck to relieve inflammation around the disc. ( Fast forward: Three rounds of injections only provided minimal relief for 1-3 weeks at best, after speaking with my doctor about the results, or lack thereof, I was getting from the injections, I was told that it was optional if I wanted to continue with this treatment. I tried one last time, with a week of minimal to no relief and decided to end this as the procedure is very uncomfortable and I felt as if I was wasting my time with something that wasn't working. ). I also stopped taking over the counter anti-inflammatory drugs as they provided minimal help and I am concerned what taking these in significant doses on a daily basis can cause. The spine specialist insisted that this kind of disc inflammation and pain related to a bulging disc should have rough patches and some limitation, but not to this extent unless it was herniated which additional MRIs have confirmed it is not. I could not, and still cannot, partake in any physically demanding activity that has any sort of jarring motion (impact with ground during running, climbing that uses my shoulder, swimming laps, even a single burpee or jumping jack is awful). All of these things aggravate the nerves in my back sending me right back into a state of shooting sharp pains. This extreme drop off in ability to do pretty much anything that I liked previously has been miserable, to say the least. My sleeping degraded quickly as I never feel tired enough to sleep, so I barely do -- averaging maybe 3-6 hours a night -- down from 8-9 hours previously. Despite never feeling tired enough to sleep, I feel fatigued all day long. About 4-6 months after the occurrence initial pain, I started experiencing non-stop muscle soreness and pain across my upper and mid back. To the point that I started needing breaks after walking around or standing too long. Walking around a shop or a public place with my significant other has went from a happy activity to me constantly looking for a seat or something to lean on. I brought this up with my physicians and the consensus was that my nerve pain has caused my body to adjust to compensate. This is straining my back and causing widespread muscular pain across the muscles in my upper back. I was told to try to work on my posture (which has been degrading during this whole ordeal), and that using a brace would be bad as it would only make my muscles dependent on it and weaker. For a particularly rough period of muscular and nerve pain, my doctor prescribed Ultram. I had to stop this as it left me in a constant fatigued haze even worse than I already was. Because of the constant soreness/pain/fatigue, I'm pretty much reduced to a expressionless face to anyone but my closest family. My demeanor and personality has changed significantly. I am probably the least approachable looking person that most people I encounter have to deal with, a permanent "I'm over this shit" face. They notice it. I notice it. It's not that I want to be this way, I just feel as if I am trapped in my own body. Every now and then I'll have a few "good" days and think I'll go for a light jog -- or my current approximation of one, more like what I'd used to consider barely past speed walking -- but I'll get a few streets down from my place and the one side of my back and arm will be lit up with shooting pains and the overwhelming soreness will start to drag me down. Sometimes I make it a little further for maybe 10 minutes or so, usually because I'm so infuriated at the pain that I just don't give a fuck, but in the end I still feel defeated because I clearly can't do what I want to -- not even close. I don't tell anyone other than my significant other or close family about all of this, so I've pretty much fallen out of touch with all of my friends as sitting or laying down encompass 99% of my free time now. I eventually started getting daily migraines that I could only fix by going to sleep for a few hours. I also started waking up in the middle of the night full on angry, heart racing, chest tight. The doctor listened and sent me to a specialist for migraines, who cured them relatively quickly with the only medicines I currently take. The specialist said the migraines are likely from lack of sleep, and my spine specialist said that my body might be slow to heal if I really am getting terrible sleep, so I was told to get a sleep study. The sleep doctor initially thought I might have sleep apnea but wanted to wait for the results first. I completed the sleep study, and when I woke up I felt miserable. I was delirious and felt like I had terrible sleep. When the nurse went through the questionnaire afterwards and asked how long it felt like I slept, I told her that I didn't feel that I could have slept for more than an hour or two. I had taken the next day off and after getting home I immediately went to bed and slept until the middle of the afternoon. Which felt like it was the result of a full collapse after being awake for 24+ hours. When I went back for my results the sleep doctor asked about what I thought of the sleep study. I explained how terrible it was and how I went home and slept into the afternoon because I felt like I stayed up all night. He told me that I had slept for approximately 7 hours and that there was absolutely nothing wrong with me, not even anything related to rotating shifts, and he didn't see any reason to do anything other than work on maintaining a steady sleep and wake schedule (best as I can with rotating shifts). He also mentioned that I shouldn't sleep into the afternoon, something that I normally don't do as my wake/sleep times vary 1-2 hours at most, even though I told him I only did it after feeling like I didn't rest at all during the study. I thought he was joking at first and asked what the deal really was, but when I realized he was serious I don't think I said much of anything else because all I wanted to do was start swinging. I walked out of the office confused, angry, upset. My doctors have ran multiple blood tests for who knows what but haven't mentioned anything other than what I have written about here. I really don't know what to do. The doctor thinks I've also developed anxiety in relation to all of this. I think I'm just fucking mad because now I'm a lazy couch potato with constant pain. Not to mention my appetite is relentless from the amount of food I've been used to eating after all these years of highly active lifestyle, yet I have to portion control everything and eat plenty of high fiber stuff to make me feel full just to make sure I don't end up being 200kg but this still hasn't kept me from gaining 10+ kg so I'm clearly not anywhere near starving. I don't ever complain or bitch about this in public until now. Like I said, only my close family, significant other, and doctors know about it. I stopped drinking entirely (which I only ever did socially, maybe 1-4 beers) because of my medications, obviously, but also because I'm getting so frustrated with all of this that I don't want to get caught up in doing something stupid like drinking to cover this up. I just want to stop hurting and reclaim some form of my past normal even if it is greatly reduced or limited, but no one seems to have any answers for me, just more questions and lots of medications to cover it all up. If anyone can just help me out with some insight or something, I will be forever grateful.Summary:
Summarize: Trying to pass without hormones is frustrating. I haven't been correctly gendered by a stranger since I started to try. I blame my round face, eyebrows that are still recovering from years of waxing, and my makeshift binder. I've been reluctant to speak in public as well because if my appearance had anyone wondering about my gender, my voice would remove all doubt. I didn't know that you didn't have to make an attempt to pass before getting hormones. I started trying because I thought it would be expected of me when I started therapy and I wanted to make sure being male was what I wanted. It has definitely affirmed that I want to transition, but it also brought on tons of dysphoria that I'd never experienced before. Tuesday night I had a date with a friend/acquaintance whom I hadn't told about the new changes in my life, so I pulled out my female clothes and shaved my legs and underarms. Never have breasts and smooth legs felt so wrong on me. I think I actually mourned the loss of my leg hair a bit, even though I know it will be back.Summary:
Summarize: About a year after I joined the military I was doing some training at blackwater and thought I was cooler than I was. I grew up not far from where I was stationed and often went home for the weekend and threw hotel parties. So a girl asks me to escort her to her senior prom (I'm only a year older than her) and I accept and offer to throw a party. So while I'm getting ready, my tux mostly on me and a friend get to practicing disarming techniques we'd learned on each other. Well... He was holding a knife (because we're idiots) and I performed the move in a manner more effective than I was ever taught. The knife flew back and shot into his mouth, sliced open his lip, gums and chipped a tooth. Then the knife fell out of his mouth and landed less than an inch from his foot. The blood started flowing pretty quick and all I could do was apologize and offer well wishes cos I was in my tux and couldn't get blood on it... It was only a rental. I have no idea why he didn't punch me. Instead he just drank a fifth Hennessey and passed out - like a boss.Summary:
Summarize: Aerys was a crazy fuck that burnt people alive just out of completely imagined paranoia and was fully ready to destroy the largest city in the continent believing he would be reborn as a dragon amidst it all and was in general such a mad man that he managed to incite a revelion that took down a dinasty that lasted almost 300 years. Now, it can certainly be argued that Dany's choice in doing this was unwise but I really don't see anything "mad" about it. 1) She's very angry on a very personal level because Barristan was a loyal friend and advisor. People can often do nasty things when they're in that mindset without necesarily being crazy. 2) All of them, even if not directly related to this incident, are in fact slave masters; cruel as hell and each and every single one of them surely wants to see her dead. They are not their friends, they are not innocent people in general terms and it's logical to assume that at least some of them are involved with the Sons of The Harpy.Summary:
Summarize: My husband's a DJ. The worst wedding he's been to the bride and groom were from two separate gangs. Several people showed up to the reception wearing their colours. He was handed a note to read at the beginning of the dance telling everyone that if there was going to be a fight, they couldn't fight in the hall and that they had to fight outside. He ended up calling his boss to help him run all his gear to the car because he had to shut down the show early. People were starting to threaten him for playing the wrong music. (It was music the bride and groom and other guests had requested). Of course, at our wedding, things went perfectly until my smooth talking transient cousin stole some golf carts and my drunken family all went on joy rides around the golf course. We didn't know what had happened until we both went outside and the site coordinator, my mom and my cousin were all talking, with the coordinator threatening to shut down the reception and call the cops to arrest my cousin for theft and something else. She actually did call the cops and for some reason let my cousin talk to them over the phone. They never showed up. Like I said, smooth talking. edit:Summary:
Summarize: Guys I'm at the end of my rope and I don't know what to do. My partner was promoted to retail manager at his company; he runs a store that's permanently under/poorly staffed, due to head office wanting to keep costs down. He's been in this role for 18 months, and it's persistently gotten worse and worse. He works 45-50 hour weeks, staying in late every single day on average of 1 hour, sometimes 3 hours, and occasionally even more. I don't want to talk about the specifics, because you'll know the company & because it's just a tedious story of overwork. But his health is in steady decline and I can't seem to get through to him. We rarely have sex, he's managed to neglect his entire social circle, and he never has any energy or enthusiasm for anything. He says he can't even think straight, and has trouble forming coherent thoughts or making decisions even in his downtime. What worries me most is he's lost weight. He was slender to start with, but now I estimate his BMI is somewhere around 17. We had to stop riding bikes the other day, because he felt unwell; out of breath and unable to pedal. We used to ride at least two miles every day for fun. He couldn't even get around the block. But he doesn't seem to think anything is wrong -- at least, not wrong enough to make any changes? I feel really alone about this right now. I keep asking him how bad things have to get before he makes any changes, but he won't give me a straight answer. He thinks that if he steps down from work - for a company he loves insanely btw - he'll be seen as a failure. I don't know what I'm supposed to do. I feel like by pointing out the problems, I'm only adding on a whole other bucket of stress to his life -- and when I speak about my concerns, I don't feel like I'm getting through to him. What can I do to make things clearer? I really want to support him, but I just feel like I make things worse.Summary:
Summarize: I have both but haven't turned on my PS3 for ages. Quite honestly Xbox live in my opinion is so far ahead of the PS network. It's just a lot more smoother, better interface, huge library of arcade games, etc. And again, in my opinion the xbox controller is the greatest controller ever made. It fits so perfectly in my hand and the analog tension is perfect. The PS controller annoys me with it's loose analogs and the fact that the left and right analog are so close together and on the same height. But to credit the PS3, it does have more exclusives than the Xbox and you can use it as a blu ray player also. So it has those 2 things going for it. Although, graphics wise if it's not an exclusive the xbox almost always has better graphics since it's ported over to the PS3. Barely noticeable anyway though and anyone that buys either console based off the graphical difference is crazy.Summary:
Summarize: I have been very close to this friend for about a year and I have always known he was interested in me. He was the friend who's shoulder I cried on when my ex cheated on me and broke it off and since then we have gotten closer as friends. I had made it clear to him several times that I haven't moved on from my ex and will need a lot of time before I think about dating anyone again. I didn't directly address him with that statement but it has come up a couple times in casual conversation so he knows I'm not ready for a relationship at this point. It's been about 5 months since my ex left and last Wednesday night we were drinking with our group of friends and at the end of the night it was only me and him and we ended up having sex. I regretted it as soon as I woke up the next morning because I was just drunk and lonely and I felt bad for doing this to him. Now here's where I become a huge bitch, ever since that night the way he talks to me just kind of grosses me out and makes me not want to talk to him. Instead of being his normal joking around self, he texts me that he misses me ALL THE TIME, literally 5 or 6 times a day and every conversation turns into him complimenting me and sending me pictures of flowers and stuff. I've been using finals week as an excuse to not talk to him more than a couple texts a day and not see him. I just feel so weird and kind of icked out by him since, because of how he professes his love for me everyday and acting completely different. I know I fucked up and shouldn't have slept with him and should have told him before that it was just sex and nothing else but now it's so far gone because I didn't know what to do. Is there anyway I can let him down gently after all the damage I did?Summary:

Summarize: I've know a few people who this happened too. Their family disowned them and completely broke contact, one kid hadn't seen or herd form any relative for 7 years. I met most of them when I was in college and every signal one of them were fucked up. They were all horrible people that were well on their way to being sociopaths. Their empathy for others feelings where gone or was ignored, even purposely hurt. When they learned that nobody in their family truly loved them and were just broken and now permanently angry at the world. The worst were the ones who joined the military to ensure that they could never act on their "urges".Summary:
Summarize: Preventative measures are the best cure, basically stopping the worst of the hangover before you have one. Hydration is key, so like everyone's said, drink the hell out of water. If not intermittently while drinking, then lots after. Remember, you piss more liquid than you actually consume. It's also not all water, meaning you're losing vitamins and other precious bodily fluids (okay not a bio major, so I'm not sure what, exactly). Taking vitamins before bed helps, as does aspirin before you crash. So my approach as follows: When I get home, before bed I have a gatorade followed by water, advil, and all-in-one vitamins. I try to stay awake through the worst of my drunkenness, re-hydrating the whole time. Water when I wake up, even if I know I'm going to roll over and sleep some more. And water upon getting up for good, followed by that chicken soup-in-a-cup stuff. It's amazing, the morning after. I'm doing my best to elevate hangover treatment to an art form.Summary:
Summarize: I got my roommates R and M to come to a party with me on the other side of the dorm and we played a couple of drinking jenga and other slow burn drinking games. We chilled and we just drunk enough to have fun with it. V or (HB 8.5) according to my roommates was very social and flirty with only 1 drink to her name for the majority of the night. She apparently had a boyfriend but she made at least one comment about how they were fighting because of shitty shit he had done. I was at like a 2 from vaping weed when we all headed over and we all had a few beers. After a few hours of drinking games some of the other guys headed home and there was RA drama when some of the guys got caught outside with alcohol. Once everything settled down I sat next to HB on the couch started up casual kino again. We eventually were alone on the couch and I took the oppurtunity to make a reference to when we joked about being dared to kiss eachother earlier. She reacted well, gave eye contact so I kissed her for about 5 seconds, then nibbled her bottom lip and seperated. I then made a quick comment about how I was glad we had some alone time so we could connect without causing her drama. She said she didnt really mind etc and we continued to sit on the couch and talk until the other girls started to goto bed and I had to exit. She # closed me and sent me a goodnight text. My roommates thought she was awesome but lamented the fact she had a boyfriend and it crippled there game. I kept it casual till the moment was right and just forced my mind past the possible failure and awkwardness with the help of a bit of alcohol. Just keep up background kino esclation and eventually the situation will give you some alone time to capitlize.Summary:
Summarize: I knew this kid back in middle school through high school. His first time masturbating was in the shower, he used shampoo as lube and it got in his eyes he slipped in the shower clinging to the shower curtain as he fell ripping it and the pole it was off breaking them and then banged his head on the tub. To top it all off his mom came in because of all the loud noises to find him covered in blood with sudsies in his eyes and his lubed up dick in his hand.Summary:
Summarize: I found a pretty easy way to beat her, but be warned this method is kinda cheap. On the lower-left hand of the room, there's a small area you can stand which is close enough to the left door so that her foot doesn't come down, but it's also too far for her hand to hit you. From there, you can only be damaged by the enemies she spawns. Just continue shooting upwards as she will continue poking her hand/eye/skin out of the door and you'll get free shots off on her. The enemies she spawns is limited to a maximum of 3 in the room at a time. If you're really lucky, you'll get something like flies on the far right side of the room that won't even aggro to you. If that happens, you're basically home free. You can stand there and shoot her while she has no way of hitting you. Also, familiars that do damage upon touch do tons of damage.Summary:

Now as for your actual in game behavior. It's as easy as A, B, C. A Always, B Be, C Casting. A - B - C. Always be doing stuff. In an instance/pvp? Always be pressing buttons. Waiting for that BG queue? Kill maim burn dig mine farm force your pets into brutal gladitorial combat. If you are waiting for a queue pop a potion of luck, (you can get golden lotus from the tillers) and go murderface on the vale. Kill all the mogu. You net 1k gold per hour + skyshard so you can ride Alani or sell it. Finally - regarding being a hunter - look at icy veins to make sure you are pushing the right buttons, ask mr robot will tell you if you are gemmed reforged and enchanted right, and finally look at the players around you. My priest is 568, as a disc priest it's not uncommon for me to top meters in 5 man. Does it mean the dps is shit? No. It means I have over ONE HUNDRED ITEM LEVELS ON THE INSTANCE. For scale that is the gap between heroic ICC 25 man and Normal Mode Firelands in gear. That being said if you come across another hunter in blues and greens and they smoke you - you need to sit down and look at your playstyle.Summary:
Summarize: People can really f ool you. I had a counselor in elementary school who everybody LOVED - especially the kids. He would sit with the kids at lunch and pass around a couple boxes of oreos, and he seemed more like a f riend than a teacher. He was also a pastor and an incredible artist, and he'd take requests from the students. I was one of the more troubled kids at the school, didn't really have any f riends and had already been expelled from 3 schools, so he decided to let me join the morning show. I thought he was pretty cool, and we became friends. I can't really remember everything, but he did take me to the movies one time, and a f terwards he took me to Wal-Mart to get a Hot Wheels car. A f ew weeks later, he took me to this small church and we worked on morning show stu ff together. My dad's nope alarm went o ff pretty quick, and didn't want me to hang out with him anymore. He said something just didn't f eel right about the guy. My mom pretty much overthrew him, though. Two weeks later, the owner o f the church f ound over a dozen recordings of him drugging/molesting/raping **children in the church computer, as well as a list of over 100 boys he planned on molesting. (Dad: "BAM, DAD KNOWS BEST GET REKT MOM") My name was on the list, but he never tried anything despite having me alone in the church. I think it was because I was a pretty aggressive/violent kid, and I probably would have f ought back or something. He had threatened the other kids with violence if they told anyone. He claimed that he did it because his f ather had done it to him. He had two children, a little older than me.Summary:
Summarize: This quest is about a bodyguard that impresses his customers by arranging fake attacks by a gang of four his buddies. It becomes pretty obvious after he fires three rounds, presumably blanks, dropping four people. This happens in a back alley where random ACTUAL thugs occasionally spawn. So sometimes, four guys limply drop to the ground and the fifth guy in the group charges your body guard with a sledgehammer. This is, of course, completely hilarious. While three shots were enough for the first four, the bodyguard lights up the fifth guy with six head shots from a .50 cal pistol before he goes down.Summary:
Summarize: It was kind of a bittersweet meet up honestly. Definitely not anything special or at all what we had discussed, but not exactly a disaster either. I'm not sure how to tell this story so I'm just going to start... My birthday is this month and he had been discussing what he wanted to do for/to me. How he wanted to just make the day all about my pleasure, sort of like the first time we slept together. He told me he got massage oil and and had been telling me he couldn't wait to get his hands on me, to tease me, and to taste me. That he wouldn't let me have his cock until I came for him. On his lips. That plan definitely went out the window. When I walked in he wrapped his arms around me and kissed me. My lips, my ears, my neck, and I was doing the same. Before I knew it he picked me up, my legs were wrapped around him, and he carried me to the desk. My dress was up around my hips and I could feel how hard he was through my thin tights. He pulled each of my legs up to his chest, running his hands the entire length, to remove my shoes as I laid back. I thought he was going to take me right there but we made it to the bed. We barely made it to the bed. He was pulling my tights off and on top of me in seconds. He left my panties on to tease me, letting me feel his hard cock against me. I reached down an pushed my panties aside and with one firm thrust I had all of him. That first moment always feels amazing. I feel so full, so tight around him. He fucked me like that, half of our clothes still on, moaning into my ear and neck, until he came. We relaxed still wrapped up in each other before finally stripping off the rest of our sweaty clothes and having a drink. We had somehow knocked the box of chocolates off the bed and wasted half of them. He laughed about how I ruined his plan and I told him there was still time. As we were talking and laughing and grazing what was left of the candy we we ended up discussing his wife and how jealous she is of one of their single neighbors and an invasion of his privacy that she did recently. I didn't know what to say and half hoped he wasn't making it up because of our communication talk recently (which we came to an agreement on anyway) and half hoped he was because it was a little crazy. Despite that awkward moment he soon had his hands on me again. I was the little spoon and he was caressing my body. Running his fingertips down my side, over my ass, gently kissing the back of my neck and nibbling my shoulder, until his fingers found their way between my thighs. He growled into my ear, mmm, as he does, "you're so wet for me" and I moved my ass against him so he could get inside me. I responded with a soft moan and told him I wanted him. He kept massaging my clit with his figers, his other hand across my chest holding me close, as he slowly but firmly pushed himself into me over and over, sending little waves of pleasure throughout my body. I could hear his breath quicken, even over my own noises, feel it against my neck. I was pushing back against him, my legs trembling, mumbling incoherent "yes"s between moans as he kept his pace. The perfect pace. As I started to cum he forced himself as deep as he could get and held his cock there, his fingers making just the right movements to take me over the edge, the arm over my chest held me tightly as I shook. After enjoying that for a few moments I rolled back against him, throwing a leg on each side, without losing his cock I was riding him backwards. This always makes me laugh a little because it reminds me of the "crab walk" game in elementary school. So, as I can't believe that is sexy, I sat up into reverse cowgirl. He loves looking at my ass and squeezing it and seeing me take him in. After what I believed was a good workout I hopped off and wrapped my mouth around him. I sucked all of my juices off of him. But I could only go so long wothout it and I started riding him again, leaning over to nibble his ears. The way he was grabbing me, the almost grunts I could hear, I knew he wanted it harder so I gave it to him, but before long he had me on my back again, with a pillow underneath me and my legs over his shoulders. He knows I love this, the slow deep thrusts and the way it makes his pelvis rub against my clit. It wasn't long befire my knees were buckling again and he started riding me hard, pushing my body towards the edge of the bed. By the time we finished my head and shoulders were hanging off. We didn't notice this but the clock in the room was an hour ahead so we didn't think we had much time afterward. We layed there relaxing and laughing and snuggling until he got into the shower. I watched him get dressed longingly and he came back to bed. It is always so hard for either of us to leave, and he started teasing me again. He was kissing my neck, which drives me crazy, and I alid his hand between my legs to show him exactly how crazy. Once he felt how badly I wanted him he started using thise fingers. Moaning and writhing he asked "can I make you cum like this?". I had to be honest. The answer was no. No one can, I barely can make it work myself. So he left me like that! All worked up wth no release. . . . . .Summary:

Summarize: I know this may end up being another "reddit knows balance" but the changes to veigar and morde seems to fuck their core gameplay, ie veigar laning phase and trades are all about his q, now with q being a skill shot, w as hard to hit as always (now even harder due to the changes to e) and e delay is just next level nerf... about morde they mentioned that they are going to reduce his brust, like, really? All of this started with changes in compensation about dfg removal, how are nerfs compensations, wtf... Now, i can be seeing everything wrong, maybe... id like to know if there are opinions from veigar and morde mains about the impact dfg removal had on these champs and also their opinions in these "compensations" becouse what i understand they are compensating the remove of a brust dmg core item that was built most of the time on these champs by nerfing them/changing their core gameplay (see veigar laning phase)Summary:
Summarize: I've been living with my roommate (who I've known since I was 11) since last October and over the past 10 or so months she has become sluttier and sluttier. She has slept with over 25 men since I moved in and her number is only rising. Since the spring she has not only been sleeping with lots of men but she sleeps with them all over the apartment- like on the kitchen counter (ew). I've asked her to stop and she shrugs the whole thing off like it's no big deal. Luckily although her sluttiness has been getting out of control I have a wonderful boyfriend and we are about to move in together. I told her the last week of July that we had found a place and I would be moving out in September. She said that was fine as she has another friend to move in with her. I spoke with that friend and we made a tentative agreement to do the moving switch the middle of the month. I now have a surgery scheduled earlier in september so I told this friend I'd be out by the first. After a few texts back and forth over the course of a few days it seemed assumed that we would split September's rent. Tonight as my boyfriend and I came home to my apartment I opened the door to see my roommate giving head to a man I've never seen before on the couch. The door was not locked. They were both butt naked. The whole apartment STUNK of weed. (I am not a smoker and neither was she before this slut faze began... I'm cool with smoking but I do believe that if you're going to do it at home both housemates should agree it's ok). The boyfriend and I instantly started to get headaches from the smell so I quickly grabbed as much stuff as I could and we left to go back to his place for the night. I am feeling that I cannot live with her any longer. Her blatant disregard for what I've asked has gone too far and I'm not comfortable staying there anymore. Rent for August is paid and as of Wednesday Cable/Electricity will be paid as well. We have not signed a lease on this apartment and as far as I know my name is not on the month to month lease, the cable, electricity or any other bill. My question is this: besides my conscious taking a hit and technically being a big doucher, is there anything stopping me from refusing to pay the rent I had verbally agreed to pay for September? Initially I had planned on paying (the split rent with the new girl) but because now I feel like I can't live there I no longer feel like it should be my responsibility. I hope hoping for some advice on what the next course of action should be.Summary:
Summarize: Was the best part of working at LameStop. My co-workers and I made it a game to make the game sound so disgusting in an attempt to make the child cry when the parent grew upset. One of the best parts was the kid looking at the parent with big eyes "I didn't know!? What!?". Especially Spanish speaking parents who's English speaking children would take advantage of them to buy the M-Rated games and sadly will nod to anything you tell the parent because they don't understand. I spoke enough Spanish to mention the game had sex, violence and boobs.(GTA).Summary:
Summarize: I'm so bummed I missed the beginning of this thread because this will certainly be buried. BUT- I worked as a Girl Scout camp counselor for three years. A lot of crazy shit happened, including a camper being sent home for pulling a knife on the rest of the unit, but my favorite was the summer we were besieged by bears. This family of bears just decided they didn't give a fuck and started brazenly traipsing through the tent units to get to the dumpster behind the kitchen. They also clawed in the screen window in one of the cabins. At one point a bear showed up outside the dining hall window in broad daylight, in full view of all the campers. My group happened to be stationed in the tent unit they passed through every night, so we kept having to sleep in the dining hall or squeeze into a cabin with another group. Finally the dumpster was moved and the bears went away, but the girls were still nervous about sleeping in the unit. We (the counselors) decided the best way to deal with their fear was to work them into a blood frenzy. We had 20 twelve year old girls dancing around a campfire with mud on their faces singing about bringing the head of the bear back on a pike. One girl ran off and pissed in the treehouse to 'mark our territory.' We slept in the unit that night, and the counselors were all pretty on edge despite all our bravado. We had pots and pans next to our beds ready to start clankin' at the first sign of bear activity. Then, around midnight, we heard something big walking through the campsite. THIS IS IT, we thought. We all sprang upright in bed, whaling on that crockery like our lives and the lives of 20 minors depended on it and screaming the Little Red Wagon song at the top of our lungs. Turned out we just scared the shit out of a camper who got up to use the bathroom. But we felt like HEROES, dammit.Summary:
Summarize: Look, the way I see it, the government shouldn't make it easy or hard for anyone to make money. The occupiers and I have this in common. Where we differ is that I don't believe that there's a big corruption conspiracy that makes it easier for the rich to stay richer. Sure, if you're born to a rich family you have a huge leg up, but family money doesn't last forever, and eventually you'll get a granddaughter like that kardashian bitch who'll spend it all and then bam. Even field. I just want the occupiers to focus less on "give us their money" and more on "don't take money from anyone" which is the only way to have true equality in this country.Summary:
Summarize: I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say Mr. Rogers wasn't the sole guy responsible for what they're claiming he did. Yes, it is kind of stupid to say that a person is special when they've put forth no effort and that they're wonderful just as they are, because if you've ever worked retail or a similar job, you'll know that makes people the most entitled jerks they'll ever be. Teenagers are usually the worst, but a lot of little kids are the same way. Fox does have a point by saying this sentiment, but they're just trying to rile up attention by pinning it all on Mr. Rogers. Teachers, parents, strangers, a lot of people contribute to this problem in developing kids. As they say, it takes a village to raise a child.Summary:
Summarize: Don't worry. I'm a complete idiot and I recognize some of that as electricity and magnetism diagrams/equations. And I can even tell you some of the mechanics that's on that board! There's a diagram on Raleigh Scattering (just left of center). A potential energy diagram for a bound system (the graph in the middle with the V(r) equation), a harmonic oscillator diagram of some sort right above that... I think.... I think there's a diagram explaining what would happen to an electron-proton system without Quantum Mechanics (the swirl above the triangle-thing). I see a diagram that I GUESS is supposed to be a proton with a wave-form electron around it (on the right)? And a Gaussian probability graph (also on the right). But like I said, I'm among the dumbest people I know (and I don't know that many extraordinary people).Summary:
Summarize: throwaway and rant to get something offmychest I've had a fling with a girl for the past semester, lets call K. K and I have been in a similar friend group (which involves several of the people I live with) for about 2 years now.The fling started early this past semester. It was never anything serious, maybe once or twice a month when she was over at my house partying she'd come back to my room and we'd fuck a few times. We'd hang out occasionally outside of that as well. The last time we hooked up was a month ago before finals and before I started studying for a big exam for a few weeks. K and I still hung out and chatted occasionally during this time. I went home for a week and she texted me a lot a lot while I was gone making it seem like she wanted to hook up again. I finally get back to campus and shes partying at my house and it seems like things are going well and we'll hook up that night. Eventually K decides to leave to go to another house for a bit and I opt to go with some of my friends somewhere else. We make out before we parting ways and she's texting me a lot while we're a part offering to come back to my house because I was kind upset about something else at the time. Fast forward to me coming home and asking if she'd like to meet up. I learn that K is too drunk at the house she was at and I didn't want to deal with that so I go to bed. Well turns out after going to bed she fucked one of the guys at the house she was at (also a mutual friend). She doesn't know that I know this. I learned from one of her online blogs that I found by accident and check from time to time (terrible idea btw). While my time with K was very lustful, she's beautiful, has a kick ass body, and we have excellent physical chemistry. Yet, I didn't agree with a lot of her life choices and she was difficult at times to deal with. What upsets me most is that while I was away from campus she was texting me things about wishing I was back on campus and wanted to know when I'd get back and what I was doing. I was excited to get back to her and continue our fling. I guess I got led on and let my hopes get up for nothing. It was also upsetting how before we parted ways that night she acted really into me, lots of touching and the make out before she left. Then she turned around and has sex with someone else. I know I can't blame her because we were never dating. These kind of flings always end with someone getting hurt and I guess this time it was me. The way she described it on her blog didn't even sound remorseful or worried that I'd find out. It just sounded factual and content with what happened. I want to confront her about it somehow even though I know its is a bad idea. I get more upset by the thought of her thinking I still don't know and that everything is fine. The next time she wants to try and sleep over at my house, I know that if I say no and wont let her she'll just go off and fuck this guy again which also sucks to think about. I know I have no choice though and we can't hook up again. Thank you for reading, if you have any input feel free to shareSummary:
Summarize: I walked into a house with my friend relapsing heroin. I grabbed the syringe and emptied it into the sink and looked back. This wasn't the first time I've seen him do this but this time he looks really bad. He was pale and his eyes weren't looking at me with that I'm perfectly fine and happy. He wasn't speaking and his eyes just had the message of help me written all over them. His breathes were very irregular and he started to nod off very quickly. I called 911 and it turns out he was overdosing. The er said if I hadn't walked in then that next shot would have killed him.Summary:
Summarize: Have a permanent scar on my dick from having too much sex. Not even joking. Here's how it went down. Had sex with my girlfriend. Afterwards, I realized the sides of my dick were kinda sore. This happens a few more times after sex and then I see the sides are a little pink. A few more sexytimes and all of a sudden, there is a tiny hole in my dickskin. After having sex, it starts to get more painful. But then we get horny again, have more sex. Did you know your pain tolerance goes up a lot during sex? The hole gets bigger. AFTER sex, I realize it is really painful. We decide to stop having sex to let it heal. But instead, we have more sex and it gets larger. We try using condoms to help or something. Nothing works. Eventually, it gets to the size of my pinky finger nail. I think eventually the pain overrode wanting to have sex because it healed, but that was a couple years ago so I don't remember. I think it was because she had shaved and had really sharp pubes? Not sure.Summary:

Summarize: During high school, my friends and I used to play paintball in the woods. We wore old clothing to play and look liked a wild pack of bum kids. So one day we all gathered up our loose change and go to Checkers. We ended up going going to a Checkers located in the ghettos. Weve been to that ones of times and never gotten any shit. So we park, order our food and sit down and wait for our meal outside. There was a couple arguing not too far from us. We paid no attention to them. Our food was done and we start eating. The guy that was arguing with his girl came up to us and said "YO!". We stayed quite. "YALL GOT DRANKS?!". I look at him and say "...no". He immediately went to reach for something behind his back and at the same time all of us were about to get up and gtfo thinking we were gonna get shot. He actually pulled out a wad of money and said "I GOT YALL NIGGAAAAAAAAAS" and bought us fucking drinks.Summary:
Summarize: to be fair, Schetrkarn said (s)he was in a manic phase. which would indicate bipolar disorder. which would indicate he or she wasn't in a healthy frame of mind. the fact that the mental illness aspect of the comment went right over your head might be why the downvotes are coming, rather than people thinking you have a stick up your butt. people who deal with mental illness aren't really a great standard for acceptable behavior. Schtekarn said they haven't made any similar jokes, so it doesn't sound like a regular thing for them. btw, my cousin was on the plane that hit the pentagon, and i'm not offended by his or her comment. But i would be if the manic episode hadn't come into play. Also, spend some time with some cops, firefighters, emts, etc. get a taste of their gallows humor. you would be shocked, but it helps them cope. as long as they are sensitive when they are dealing with victims or victims' families i say whatever gives them some relief without hurting themselves or others is fine.Summary:

Summarize: Was in a sex shop. Toward the back it said, "Tonights show is free to enter." So my SO and I strolled in. I expected it to be some kind of peep show you slip money under the window for. After all we were in Vegas. So we get in and turn the corner. There was a cheap porn flick playing on a huge screen. White chairs lining the room and last but certainly not least, guys (truck drivers) blowing each other on the chairs that were being used. When they saw us dicks were shoved back in thier pants. Yeah we walked about.Summary:
Summarize: Freshman year of college me and my friend finished finals at the same time. So naturally we wanted to toke. Our roommate's/friends where still studying for finals, so instead of smoking in our dorm rooms we had to find somewhere else to smoke. We were a little bummed because it was freezing outside (this was in winter), and we were fucking tired from finals. The best smoking spot is a little far away from our dorm building, but we are like fuck it. If we have to go outside to smoke, let's go to the best spot on campus right? We pre-pack the bowl so we don't have to mess around with it in the dark woods. And then leave some in the grinder for a second. We bundle up in our coats and trek out to our favorite smoke spot. Which is in the middle of a circular patch of tree's on a small hill not even 10ft from one of the main roads on campus. The thing is that everyone always smokes there. There was even an old car seat there for you to sit on. Well It was a very cold and VERY foggy night. So Foggy that you could barely see a couple of feet in front of you. When we arrived to the smoke spot, we noticed that there was a police car's lights flashing in the street below us. Not even 10 ft away. It was so foggy that they had to put a squad car out on the road to warn drivers about the bend in the road. Well we both looked at each other and where pissed. We had no where else to smoke that wasn't completely out of the way, our bowl was already packed, and we were already there. So we said fuck it. And we smoked 2 bowls as we watched the cop's lights flashing below us through the fog.Summary:

Summarize: link for the curious]( Its better, but it's still a dangerous anachronism with a strong gender bias. Striking out the gay panic defence and requiring that the provocation is in response to an offence are definitely good steps that would reverse the result of a lot of the most controversial cases we've had on the defence in recent years. The requirement that the provoking conduct is an offence puts the defence as a bit of a catch-all for murders that fall short of self defence, which is a bit odd. Anything that limits the availability of provocation is great, but I feel like we should just be done with it. Provocation functions to limit the liability of people (in almost every single case, men) that see red and kill others. From a public safety point of view, those people are dangerous. In my opinion, the fact that the response happens immediately does little to excuse the conduct. I understand where the idea of white hot rage sits with regard to mens rea, but if the fact that there is an actual loss of control means that the seeing red defence would sit better as a category of substantial impairment. One of the reasons it doesn't is that diagnosticians don't recognise it (to my knowledge). Infer from that what you will. Without the proper scientific/medical understanding, it falls to the common law to form the test. We end up with provocation as it is (or was, i guess) and it undoubtedly functions to protect people who were not under the effects of the elusive loss of control (if it really exists) merely because they acted within the immediate window. The gender bias is an issue too. It isn't only evident from the data, but from the capabilities of different people. The analogous 'seeing red' response from women and people who can't basically kill someone with whatever they have at their fingertips is the situation that comes up in every second battered-woman syndrome case you read at law school - the abusee eventually snaps from the abuse, waits for their husband to go to work or whatever, and has a weapon/poisoned food waiting when they get home. The time lapse prevents them from raising provocation and BWS is pretty tough to rely on as a defence. We've had at least one law reform commission report very strongly recommend (much more eloquently than I can) that provocation be abolished. It just doesn't sit well with the rest of the criminal law and, even in this much more restricted form, its only a matter of time before another incredibly controversial case comes out of it. People often excuse it on the basis that it only downgrades a murder charge, but plenty has been written on the social significance of that label, even in an era of heavily discretionary sentencing.Summary:

Summarize: There are over 190,000 subscribers to r/atheism. Each one of you has a voice and a legitimate grievance. Namely that religion permeates the very fabric of your life and is utterly inescapable. Your schoolteachers try to brainwash you, your preachers try to brainwash your families, and anyone that voices dissent is berated or beaten until they feel utterly worthless. That's a given, and that needs to change. So let's set about making a difference. The first thing to work on is to know your enemy. To start with religion isn't your enemy. If you directly attack religion you're indirectly attacking people who would otherwise support your cause. [The Vicar of Dibley]( is not your enemy. Understand that to some people religion is hope, and when you try to attack someone's hope you will make an enemy who would otherwise be your ally. Your enemy lives in your town, they run your church, they're on the board of your schools. They use religion as a tool to further their own ends, and fill their bellies with your food. Describe them, and let others know what it's like to live as you are forced to live. Put them in your shoes, in a place where religious dogma always trumps sanity. When you know exactly who your enemy is fight them. Don't fight them directly, their influence is far greater than yours. They probably know a hundred ways to destroy you, and by the time you finally pose a threat they'll have some real world horror in store for you. It could be simple ostracisation, it could be jail, who knows. All you can be sure of is that it won't be pleasant. On your own you'll lose in a direct war of ideals. You need to play their game, slowly. Don't outright confront them, plant seeds in the minds of your family and friends. Chip away ever so slowly. Appear to be living the same life as they are, with similar beliefs. Work from within and poison the minds of others against your enemies. Don't directly say 'this is stupid', question why the bible speaks of love and acceptance, yet that doesn't seem to be part of your culture. Chip away delicately, never make a direct stand you will only make people cling tighter to the word of your pastor. Recruit allies. This is why it's important not to piss off people on the internet, you'll need them to help you. It's these people you're tossing asside for thier religion that will shout the loudest about how you're being treated. You might not think it, because the religious people you know aren't like that. What you need to come to understand is that not all religious people are like that. Most are good honest people who just want to believe that there is a God, and that God looks out for them. It's not sinister, it's merely a concept that makes them happy. If you confuse these normal people with the crazy religious freaks you know then you'll fragment your message and everyone will be fighting, but no one will be fighting the correct people. Make a stand. Right now your biggest allies will be in the Occupy Wall Street protests, and I guarantee you that your aims are identical to theirs. However if you wantonly attack religious people they will not be inclined to associate themselves with you. You need to come together and instead of occupying wall street you need to occupy main street. It wont be easy but figthing for your rights never is.Summary:
Summarize: Edit: sorry about the typo in the title. My girlfriend and I have been together for about 3.5 months. We’ve known each other for just over double that after meeting while she was with her ex-boyfriend of 5 years. I immediately liked her, as she appeared to be everything I saw in a partner/wife, but I had resigned to the fact I would never be with her because she was with her ex-boyfriend. She ended up ending breaking up with him and a few weeks later we got together. In hindsight, it probably would have been better if she had been out of a relationship for longer before we got together. Her ex-boyfriend is having a hard time letting her go. He emails and texts her almost daily about changes he has made bnout things my girlfriend would have preferred he did/like, for example, drinking coffee. My girlfriend doesn’t appear to encourage him and tells me most of times he has contacted her. While we’ve only been together a short period of time, we both agree that it has felt longer than that as we text each other all day most days, go on at least one date a week and stay overnight when we can. Maybe, it has all been too much too soon. This past week I stayed at her house on Saturday and Sunday (23 and 24/3), Tuesday, 26/3 and Thursday to Sunday nights (28 to 31/3). I was supposed to stay at her house tonight as well but I decided to go home. Most of the time we have an awesome time together - we flirt, laugh, kiss and have fun and generally enjoy spending time together, even while doing nothing in particular. However, this past week negative things have come up that have made us question continuing our relationship: While we were having sex it seemed she wasn't particularly enjoying herself. I asked her why and while she was reluctant to tell me I assured her I preferred honesty even if it was bad. She told me that a large part of her being turned on was feeling a heavy man on top of her. I'm within 10kg of her weight. I've lost more 20kg over the last two years through diet and exercise. I like how I look now, but she thinks I'm too skinny. Her ex-boyfriend weighs what I used to weigh. Hearing her say that my 'skinniness' was a turn off, turned me off, but I thought we could get past tha The next day, before we had a nap I said to her as a throwaway line, "I am undecided as to whether I like your boobs." My girlfriend's breasts aren't all natural. They also happen to be the same size as my ex-girlfriend's natrual breats. I am not sure what I was thinking saying that line, my only excuse is I was quite tired. I really do like her breasts, the vast majority of the time. The only time I don't prefer them is when she stands up naked, as they sit extremely perky on her chest, and I think I prefer less perky based on what I'm used to. The next day when we were making out and I was sucking on her nipples my girlfriend commented that since I said that line, anything I've done to her breasts has turned her off. I explained that I said that because they're different to what I am used to. She responded that next time I toucher her boobs she'll be thinking about my ex-girlfriend. Understandably, she got upset, as she had her reasons for getting new breasts, which relates to two negative incidents in her past that she has told me about. They're horrible things that I wish did not happen to her or anyone. She has said a few times since that she things they're too much baggage for me to accept and still want to be with her. In a way, it almost feels like she is challenging me to break up with her. That in turn makes me feel like there is something wrong with me for wanting her but if I don't stay with her we will have failed. Based on these things, I'm not sure if we'll feel comfortable having sex with each other again or if there is any point continuing an emotional connection. I know I'll be wondering if she is enjoying herself or what she is thinking. I'm not sure how we can go about fixing this, or if that is possible. So I seek your advice reddit...Summary:
Summarize: I'm taking a small break from College Chronicles to give you my most recent hamplanet excursion. Feel free to skip the background and head straight to the story if you'd like. Background Let me rest your jimmies by telling you that I am now 26, graduated from college in 2010, therefore I'm very much alive and was not, in fact, flayed like so many of you are worried about. After college, I got a job in advertising, so a lot of my job is sitting all day. Some days it's 6 hours, some days it's 12 hours. But it's lots of microsoft office and indesign. I quickly gained weight and went from about 110 in college to 145 in 2012. Not planetary status, but 35 pounds was enough to make my 5'4" frame cry. Last year Mrwonderful and I decided to do something about it (yes we are married now)! He kicked it into gear and went from 210 - 185 with P90X. I unfortunately was off and on making excuses. I dropped about 11 pounds. This year I kicked it into high gear. Since January 1 I've gone from 134 - 124. Booya. I also just received a promotion so we decided to celebrate last night. This is where our story begins. Story >Be Polar. Celebrating promotion and 10 pound droppage with buddies. >Don't Be RiledRhino. Hammy of planetary proportions. We arrive at a bar we frequent many weekends and thirsty thursdays. So much so the bouncer knows us and always just waves us in. It's a divey place, we did enough of the downtown-10-dollars-for-college-beer crap in high school and college. Tonight we were celebrating, I just got a promotion this week. Bonus celebration, I hit the 10 pounds lost mark. Drinks on me! I learned a valuable lesson about the relationship between losing pounds and losing my tolerance level. One beer and two measly vodka tonics in and I was a goner. I'm very much a happy, hyper, love everything type of drunk and it's pretty obvious I'm blasted. That's when I notice RiledRhino laughing and pointing at me from the other side of the bar. I scurry over. >Polar: Hey! What are we laughing about? I'm Polar by the way. >RiledRhino: Yeah no thanks. And you. I'm laughing at you. Didn't I make that obvious enough? >Polar: Hey I'm just having a good time with some friends. Nothin' wrong with that. You guys should join us! >RiledRhino: There is when your skanky ass is wack dancing all over the place. Ugh, thin girls piss me off something fierce. >Polar: What exactly did I do to you? >RiledRhino: Girl this is my bar, you walking in here is what you did. Take your lightweight ass home bitch. I've never seen this girl here. I call her out. >Polar: Hey Bouncer! Have you seen this chick here before? She says it's her bar. >Bouncer: Nope. First time in my life. >Polar: So what about this being your bar? >RiledRhino: Please. Like he's going to side with me, he's a fatshaming douchebag anyway. Now go away lightweight loser. >Polar: Are.. you.. are you like jealous of me being a lightweight or something? >RiledRhino: Actually I'm offended by it. It's so typical for thin girls. But no, I'm the unhealthy one. Right? >Polar: I don't know. Are you? Why is it so damn offensive? >RiledRhino: This is the perfect example of society's standards and how fucked they are. Look how sad and pathetic your organs are. They can't even keep up with your little tiny girly drinks. That's healthy? >Polar: Umm... >RiledRhino: No seriously. Nevermind that I can handle my booze. I've been throwing these back like water and I'm not half as retarded as you. My fat makes my organs stronger because they work harder. It gives me more muscle and alcohol tolerance. But let's all praise the skinny white trash for meeting the world's expectations. PATHETIC. >Polar: Muscle? All I see is fat. There's that whole drunk alpha-ing up thing that seems to get me in trouble. >RiledRhino: It's under a protective layer of skin dumbass. >Polar: I really think you're calling the wrong person dumbass. >RiledRhino: EXCUSE ME BROKE BITCH? She lost it and got in my face. Bouncer did his job and bounced her rhino pack out of the bar. I went back to making life decisions I would regret this morning.Summary:
Summarize: I really fucked up a few days ago but the aftermath just hit me. It was last Wednesday and I just arrived home from costco and had a raging boner. I asked my mom for the keys and ran to the bathroom. I peed in a very awkward position and proceeded to jack off. I pull out my phone and open up internet. The problem is sometimes my router goes full retard and stops working which is easily fixable by resetting it, but im too lazy and it would make it to obvious. So I'm standing up ready to masturbate but I have no porn. Normally I can jack off without porn by using my fantastic imagination but I really wanted to hear some moaning so I switched to mobile data and proceeded to look up pornhub on incognito. I get to the website and find the perfect video, but it's not working. After a few minutes I give up the conquest and jack off with my eyes closed imagining my self going down on my crush. Yesterday I was out shopping clothes with my mom and tried to look up prices but my mobile data didn't work so i shot a text at my dad telling him about the problem. About an hour later I before I arrive home it starts to work I start browsing reddit and forget about it. This morning though I couldn't help to ask my dad why my mobile data wasn't working and he told me because I went on an inappropriate website. Now at this point I knew he knew what website I was on and so I just stood there awkward and said and I quote "hmm thats weird I don't even use my phone's internet." He keeps looking at me not one word leaves his mouth. Luckily I knew this technique because of reddit and knew how to react to it. I turned around and walked away and am now in my room typing this.Summary:
Summarize: I'm a twenty-four year old female and my boyfriend and I are becoming more and more serious as time goes on. We have been together for one year now. Here is the problem: his brother, who he lives with, is an absolute asshole. Before going on to describe why this is such a problem for me, I want to talk a little more about his brother, who I will call Josh. Josh regularly describes the shitty ways he treats women and the shitty ways he tries to sleep with as many women as possible. Now, while I don't necessarily think it's bad to sleep with a lot of people (if it's consensual and done respectfully on both parts), he intentionally manipulates women to get what he wants and then is really mean to them after things are over. He admitted to having left a girl in the middle of the woods when she was high on ecstasy and he was drunk (he was driving) because she annoyed him and he no longer felt like getting in her pants. Another example: this summer he knew this one girl who he had met online wanted a relationship from her online profile, yet he went out on a date with her solely for the intention of having sex with her and never sleeping with her again. He hadn't slept with anyone in four months, so he really just wanted to get laid. Now I know a lot of people do this, and I can understand his sexual frustration, but the way he did it was really shitty. He slept with her, then the next day talked to my boyfriend and I about how fat she was and how disgusting she was and what bad lay it was. These things are possible, but the way he discusses them is rude and uncalled for. It's simply indicative of his general disrespect for women. He has a technique he has called the "machine gun makeout" which is basically to keep leaning in to kiss a woman, and each time she turns away, he tries again, and keeps trying until she gives in. He combines this technique with his "drink technique" of buying girls a drink, letting them drink half, then slamming the rest himself and buying them another one. This one is based on the theory that girls drink the first half of their drink really fast and the last half slow. He is honestly this manipulative. One time Josh made a pass at me about two months after his brother and I were official and I (obviously) turned him down. I told him "I couldn't be less attracted to you given your shallow personality", yet when I told his brother about it Josh claimed I had been wanting him all along and was asking for it. Josh spends all his days off work smoking weed, drinking, and trying to use more women for sex. I don't have any problem with weed and drinking, but both of those things are pretty much all he ever does. He has no ambition. No wish to find someone he cares about and settle down. No wish to ever have kids. He just wants to go to work and then party on his days off. Lastly, Josh is terrible with money. He makes almost $100k a year but lives paycheck to paycheck, spending it all on buiyng more "toys" (e.g. dirtbike, jetboat, truck). Again, I'm not against buying nice things for yourself as long as you budget and save for the future. He once asked me (I'm in medical school), "What kind of STUFF are you going to buy once you are a doctor?" I told him that I was going to buy a house first of all, and he laughed and said, "NO. COOL stuff! Mercedes? Mustang?" He really doesn't understand that there are things to life other than money. He asked my boyfriend to go half and half on a mortgage so they could buy a house together. I did not give my opinion because I felt it was none of my business, but was secretly SO relieved when my boyfriend told him no. I think it's a terrible idea to enter into such a long-term financial commitment with someone who is hugely in debt and can't hold onto money even with a great paying job. Anyways... back to the beginning. I hate this person more than I've ever hated anyone. I haven't described the half of it because I want to keep this short enough for people to read, but I hope you can understand the situation. My question is... would this be a dealbreaker for anyone? Up until this point in the post I haven't talked about my relationship with my boyfriend, but let me just say it is INCREDIBLE. Amazing communication. Amazing sex. We are seriously perfect partners. He makes me laugh so much that I cry sometimes. But sometimes I imagine the future and I feel sick. His brother's financial habits seem to influence him somewhat. He isn't as terrible as Josh is, but he definitely doesn't save money. I am a huge saver (seeing as how I had to put myself through medical school) and I could see those mentalities conflicting. Also if we have kids one day... his brother will be their uncle. And I couldn't keep the kids away from his brother, that would be unfair to my boyfriend. So my hypothetical children would be influenced by this man (who trust me, will never change - he never wants to get married or have children, so he will always be that creepy uncle josh). I think it would be even worse if I had boys because he would want to do things with them and teach them his "techniques" with women. It makes me want to punch something imagining these children who don't even exist yet having to be around this man who I despise with a passion. So anyways. Despite this perfect relationship with my boyfriend, do you think this sort of thing (hating one of his family members so much) could ruin it? I know that typical answers on this thread are "end it, move on", but I would appreciate some input other than that because it's not realistic. It seems silly to end a great relationship because of someone who isn't even one of the members of the relationshp. It should just be about me and my boyfriend, right? At this point it's easy to ignore his brother as we're doing distance while I finish my last year of medical school. But at some point in the next year we will be hopefully living close by again and I will once more have to deal with his brother on a regular basis since they live together. And potentially deal with his brother for the rest of my life. This pains me. Any thoughts would be appreciated, especially if anyone has ever been in a similar circumstance!Summary:
Summarize: It was kind of a bittersweet meet up honestly. Definitely not anything special or at all what we had discussed, but not exactly a disaster either. I'm not sure how to tell this story so I'm just going to start... My birthday is this month and he had been discussing what he wanted to do for/to me. How he wanted to just make the day all about my pleasure, sort of like the first time we slept together. He told me he got massage oil and and had been telling me he couldn't wait to get his hands on me, to tease me, and to taste me. That he wouldn't let me have his cock until I came for him. On his lips. That plan definitely went out the window. When I walked in he wrapped his arms around me and kissed me. My lips, my ears, my neck, and I was doing the same. Before I knew it he picked me up, my legs were wrapped around him, and he carried me to the desk. My dress was up around my hips and I could feel how hard he was through my thin tights. He pulled each of my legs up to his chest, running his hands the entire length, to remove my shoes as I laid back. I thought he was going to take me right there but we made it to the bed. We barely made it to the bed. He was pulling my tights off and on top of me in seconds. He left my panties on to tease me, letting me feel his hard cock against me. I reached down an pushed my panties aside and with one firm thrust I had all of him. That first moment always feels amazing. I feel so full, so tight around him. He fucked me like that, half of our clothes still on, moaning into my ear and neck, until he came. We relaxed still wrapped up in each other before finally stripping off the rest of our sweaty clothes and having a drink. We had somehow knocked the box of chocolates off the bed and wasted half of them. He laughed about how I ruined his plan and I told him there was still time. As we were talking and laughing and grazing what was left of the candy we we ended up discussing his wife and how jealous she is of one of their single neighbors and an invasion of his privacy that she did recently. I didn't know what to say and half hoped he wasn't making it up because of our communication talk recently (which we came to an agreement on anyway) and half hoped he was because it was a little crazy. Despite that awkward moment he soon had his hands on me again. I was the little spoon and he was caressing my body. Running his fingertips down my side, over my ass, gently kissing the back of my neck and nibbling my shoulder, until his fingers found their way between my thighs. He growled into my ear, mmm, as he does, "you're so wet for me" and I moved my ass against him so he could get inside me. I responded with a soft moan and told him I wanted him. He kept massaging my clit with his figers, his other hand across my chest holding me close, as he slowly but firmly pushed himself into me over and over, sending little waves of pleasure throughout my body. I could hear his breath quicken, even over my own noises, feel it against my neck. I was pushing back against him, my legs trembling, mumbling incoherent "yes"s between moans as he kept his pace. The perfect pace. As I started to cum he forced himself as deep as he could get and held his cock there, his fingers making just the right movements to take me over the edge, the arm over my chest held me tightly as I shook. After enjoying that for a few moments I rolled back against him, throwing a leg on each side, without losing his cock I was riding him backwards. This always makes me laugh a little because it reminds me of the "crab walk" game in elementary school. So, as I can't believe that is sexy, I sat up into reverse cowgirl. He loves looking at my ass and squeezing it and seeing me take him in. After what I believed was a good workout I hopped off and wrapped my mouth around him. I sucked all of my juices off of him. But I could only go so long wothout it and I started riding him again, leaning over to nibble his ears. The way he was grabbing me, the almost grunts I could hear, I knew he wanted it harder so I gave it to him, but before long he had me on my back again, with a pillow underneath me and my legs over his shoulders. He knows I love this, the slow deep thrusts and the way it makes his pelvis rub against my clit. It wasn't long befire my knees were buckling again and he started riding me hard, pushing my body towards the edge of the bed. By the time we finished my head and shoulders were hanging off. We didn't notice this but the clock in the room was an hour ahead so we didn't think we had much time afterward. We layed there relaxing and laughing and snuggling until he got into the shower. I watched him get dressed longingly and he came back to bed. It is always so hard for either of us to leave, and he started teasing me again. He was kissing my neck, which drives me crazy, and I alid his hand between my legs to show him exactly how crazy. Once he felt how badly I wanted him he started using thise fingers. Moaning and writhing he asked "can I make you cum like this?". I had to be honest. The answer was no. No one can, I barely can make it work myself. So he left me like that! All worked up wth no release. . . . . .Summary:
Summarize: I'm not sure about the huge base thing. My best run I built a tree home near a deer spawn point, set up a turtle catcher, and was set to go for however long I felt like going. I'm not so sure the game needs more risk so much as it currently has no form of objective to keep you from simply being done after you create a sustainable living environment. In don't starve it takes a while to create a perfect base, and without doing something damn near perfect you might freeze to death, might be killed by fire dog things, or could run out of food while trying to keep from freezing. Plus, if you build too big and don't do lightning rods your whole base could catch on fire. There are events that keep you on your toes despite much inherent risk from your hunter/gather activities.Summary:
Summarize: Exactly this. If the male/female statistics were weighted 800 to 350 for only one year, I would understand trying to make the statistics make sense if it was an outlier but this data is the same every year. Maybe it's not a fair sample size for one year but over ten years it looks like 8000 murders versus 3500 and we can't keep coming up with reasons why these statistics still aren't accurate. I went through a similar string with several other posters in this thread and it seems to me like there's an obvious agenda being pushed here. I dont know if someone from /r/mensrights posted a link to this thread or what but there's an obvious bias to how they're presenting their data.Summary:
Summarize: EDIT: I rolled back to driver 290.53 for my GTX 560 ti and this fixed the issue Recently, after the skyrim workshop update, Skyrim has refused to launch. Everytime I launch Skyrim on Steam and even Fallout New Vegas on Steam, I get an error code 51. As far as I'm concerned this has only been happening for these two Bethesda Games. I don't think this is just a random coincidence. I looked this error code up and it seems to happen to people in various times and I believe it's a Steam problem. I have a feeling that this has something to do with registries and me messing something up with Steam. I say this because I recently upgraded from an HDD to an SSD to house my OS (Windows 7). I ran into some trouble with registries with Steam when trying to run a Steam game (Saints Row: The Third) with Windows XP compatibility mode. I then went into regedit and deleted the compatibility registries. I have a feeling that I deleted a registry that I should not have. This also might not be the reason because deleting SR3 registries has little to do with Steam Bethesda games. I have tried many things: Re-installing Steam, Re-installing both games, verifying integrity of game cache, launching from the .exe launchers in their game folders. All of these did nothing. I should also mention that when launching from SkyrimLauncher.exe, I get an error: Application load error 3:0000065432 (On top of the error pop up it says Steam Error). I'm just wondering if anybody else has been having problem similar to me and if you have fixed it, please explain how. If or when I find a solution for myself, I will surely share it in an update. Thanks for reading and not losing patience with my post or getting angry from how stupid this question might be.Summary:
Summarize: Watching Alexi Laiho from Children of Bodom play. I was a metal head for a long time and one day I was just watching stuff on the web (I don't think I knew of or youtube was a thing back then, been playing over 10 years) he did like various instructional videos. I was just like "I want to be able to do that", if anything though learning the instrument has branched out my musical tastes to more than just metal.Summary:
Summarize: Okay, so... My boyfriend and I have been together on and off for three years. I'll give you the full run down of everything that's happened, but before I do that, I'll say that at least 80% of people will tell me I should just end it and I've absolutely tried several times and it just doesn't work. Why is that? Maybe you all can tell me and we can solve this whole thing right here right now because I'm going insane... Three years ago, I started dating a friend of mine with a lot of issues. I had just come out of high school and was working full time hanging out with people whenever I was free. This friends issues consisted of having several drug problems, issues with family, on the verge of being kicked out of his house he lived in with his older brother, he was on felony probation for grand theft auto (sounds bad but was a complicated situation.. Basically he was 17 and it was a misunderstanding with a friends parents and would up taking the vehicle across state lines and it was a whole big mess but still it was stupid), had no job, no high school diploma and amongst all that he was just in a terrible place in life and in his mind. When I found him, I, as always, thought for sure I would be able to save him and pull him up and out from this dark place. And I did just that. When I met him, he was going through all this and his life was on the verge of failure, but I put all that I had into him and into our relationship and he did a total 180 which I will explain later. A few months after I decided to do this thing, he did wind up getting kicked out of his house and I took him into mine and my fathers house. He stayed there a while and all was okay but soon enough he received a warrant for his arrest for failure to report (since he wasn't calling in to talk to his PO, what a moron). So basically, this guy is saying "oh yeah well I'm just gonna leave I'm not gonna go to jail la la la happy day" and I'm like no you've got to get this handled. So I drive him to the jail and he turns himself in. He gets sentenced to nine months. Seven with time served. Guess what I did? I stayed. The whole time. It was really tough and scary for the both of us. I drove 45 mins twice a week every week for the first four months he was in to go visit him, I put money on my phone to talk to him, I wrote letters, I did t all. He was always sweet and had things to say and always told me how much he loved me, but at the end of the fourth month, he started to become very quiet and distant. He became angry and bitter. Like he was becoming someone else for no reason at all. I mean, I understand that isolation and being in jail is hard on a person, but I was there for him giving all I had and I chose to spend my time on him because I loved him, or I thought I did and I felt like I deserved love and respect 100% of the time. Anyhow, once he became distant, I started visiting less, calling less, writing less and it began to turn into almost nothing at all. I had began to regain contact with an ex boyfriend of mine in this vulnerable time, and you can guess what happened next. I cheated on my boyfriend with him. I messed up and I never told him. He got out of jail a few months later and things just weren't the same. We were together all of four days once he got out and then he calls me and goes "hey can you give me a ride somewhere?" And I go yeah sure. So, having no clue were I'm taking him, he leads me out to this apartment complex insisting "it's a surprise"... We get there and out walks his ex girlfriend of two years and they share a long embrace more powerful than any he and I had shared over the course of that year we were together. I drive them back over to his house and they're thinking "we're all going to hang out and have a few drinks"... No. I wasn't doing that. I dropped them off and I wished them both the best of luck going forward as I knew they had feelings for one another with the way they had embraced moments before (messed up situation I know). Now we go separate ways for about 8 months. I start drinking pretty heavily and making some crappy choices. I moved across the country back to my hometown for about two months then realize that it wasn't where I wanted to be. I came back, got a couple jobs and tried to keep myself busy as best as I could. Out of the blue, I get a phone call. It's him. He asks "hey my mom said you were working up at the auction" (as I still kept in contact with his family) "I was wondering if you might be able to get me a job with you". Being the person I am, of course, I get him the job. He starts working with me and I learn that his relationship with this other girl wasn't what he thought it would be. They dated for 7 months and she took him for everything he had, they did nothing but do drugs and be failures until the bitter sweet end. Bottom line, he tells me all about what I've missed and I tell him all about what he's missed and in the crossfire, our relationship now is different. He is working, not on drugs, not on probation and we're friends. Good friends. Over the time he worked with me at the auction, we had a great time. Everything was going really well. Then, out of the blue, something happened. We fell in love again. But it was different this time. There was respect. There was honesty. There was hope. We had gone three months working together without a confession of real feelings and when it all finally came out, it was unlike anything I've ever been through. It was strange. It was real. Once we got back together, we were a dream team. We never argued, his family loved me, we had so much to talk about, we loved each other whole heartedly. About 6 months after we started seeing each other again, he asked me to exclusively be his girlfriend. I couldn't bring myself to say yes because I still had not fessed up about the cheating while he was away nor had I told him about the thing I did while we were separated. I had oral sex with his older brother who lived, and still lives, in the same house with him. (I know, I'm a terrible person. It was done only out of anger and spite, nothing more. It was a bad thing. I know.) So, basically I dodged the question and kept dodging until I couldn't wait anymore to confess my indecencies. It was a Saturday. 2AM and we had been drinking to excess. I decided at that moment that it was a good time to come clean. So I did. He, being intoxicated and given that kind of news, threw his drink on me and called me every name in the book... Then he hit me. Open hand. Three times in my face. My teeth were broken and my face was bruised. In my mind, I got what I deserved and had the tables been turned, with the involvement of alcohol, I would've done the same thing. Had he been sober, that event would not ever have transpired. After that, things were never the same. It started a chain reaction of break ups and make ups, mess ups and fix ups, just ups and downs at every turn. He never hit me again after that night, but the arguments grew frequent, the happiness began to fade, the resentment took hold of the both of us. After talking and talking and talking it out, we decided that if we wanted this to work, we were going to have to leave the past in the past and never come back to it ever again. We were going to have to start over. And we did. We came together and conquered what trials we faced. He cleaned up a lot. Got his GED, a car, two jobs, made things right with his family, with himself, with me. Everything was great, save the normal stupid arguments that every couple has. Things persisted on being great for about three months or so and then something happens. One of his two jobs was a pizza delivery driver that one of my long time friends helped him get. He seemed to be doing well and all was good, but one day, I get a phone call from my friend who worked with him... She goes "Grace, I feel so terrible but I was sworn to secrecy. He has been all over this girl at work, he flirts with her and says she has a nice ass and he went to a party she was at and I don't know what happened all I know is that he was being dishonest with you and I'm sorry I kept it from you". When I heard this (I am already an extremely self conscious individual and having intimate feelings for another girl is one thing I wasn't prepared to tolerate) I immediately broke up with him. At that point I had tunnel vision and wanted no discussion at all on the matter. Long story short, we ended things for about a week, then decided that we were taking everything just too seriously and needed to still be together but take a step back and be the best we can be moving forward while realizing that no relationship is perfect... And now here we are... He's great sometimes, other times not so much. Sometimes I have terrible dreams about him doing awful things to me or to someone else. I feel as though he may be a compulsive liar and maybe he could even have some severe mental and emotional discrepancies. What I do think I might know for sure is that I love him... But I don't really know what I feel anymore... About him or about anything. I'm just so drained and I'm in Cosmetology school full time and work as well, I go to the gym five days a week and I'm battling a plethora of my own emotional problems. I really really want it to work with this guy but I don't know why. I don't know if I'm blinded by love or stupidity. I don't know what's right or wrong anymore and all I want to do is be happy... I just don't know if that's possible anymore... What do I do, guys? Give me your best even if it sounds like I'm a lost cause...Summary:
Summarize: Hey, guys Sorry for all the information I'm about to give you. I just really want some help from people who know all the facts. I am 21f and my boyfriend is 22m. We go to the same college, and have been dating for over a year, and we live together. When we first started dating, we had sex a lot. It seems like everyday that we hung out ended in sex. It was awesome. Things started to slow down a little bit a few months ago. When we started living together... He is a Christian dude, except not very extreme. He turned to religion when his mom passed away last year. He was "saved" at a church camp he chaperoned over last summer, and is truly believing and passionate about God. He used to sometimes cry and say he wished I would just be "saved." I've told him that I feel silly about it and that I'm just not ready for it. So he has put it behind. I go to church with him and never try to disrespect what he believes and we are both okay with that. Except when it comes to sex. I am on birth control. It has been 2 years since I had an implanon put in. I never get a period. At first my sex drive was extremely decreased. I went a year without sex and was completely okay. But now my sex drive is through the roof. I constantly think about sex and am always horny and ready to go! Me and my boyfriend have great sex and I love it. The only problem is now that he won't have sex with me. The first month we lived together, our sex was normal as ever. It was everyday and sometimes twice a day. Now it is once every two weeks if I am lucky. Every time I try to prompt sex with him, he says that we do it too much and he is "straying from the lord." He will keep saying this until he reaches the brink of his horniness I guess. Then he'll have me give him a super quick blow job, but no sex usually. And that makes me all the more horny. But he never messes around with me or anything. I feel like he looks down on me for being so weak/horny. I have to beg and beg for him to have sex with me, but he will never give in until he wants it. And I can't deny him when he wants it, because I already want it so bad. He says all I care about in our relationship is sex, but it's not true. It just builds up inside and it's all I can think about. I feel like a horny man or something. Like other girls aren't like this. He says the devil is tempting me and I need to speak with God. I don't agree. He will have a HUGE boner that I can feel whenever I'm trying to seduce him, but he will still say no to me! I don't get it. Why is it so hard for him to do? :/ I also find that I masturbate way too much. It can be from at least 3 to 10 times a day. :( It doesn't even calm down my sex drive. At all. I just keep going and going. After sex though, I feel relieved and 'finished.' I can achieve an orgasm through masturbation, but I never feel finished, and can go right back to masturbating a minute later. I'm so embarrassed about it, and he doesn't even know I do it. He doesn't masturbate, (unless he somehow does it at work) because I am with him all the time at home. We shower together, sleep in the same bed, and everything. He will have a boner in the shower and won't let me anywhere near it. I just don't get it at all. Am I pushing him? I feel like if genders were reversed here, it would be really bad. I just don't know how to calm myself down. What should I do??? Other than our sex life, our relationship is amazing. He is everything I ever wanted, and I love him with all my heart. He makes me soooo happy, and I definitely do not want to end things with him over this. He doesn't want to get married until he has finished college and has a steady job. He wants to have a huge church wedding or something and be financially stable. That could be 4+ years before anything like that happens. I've suggested no sex at all until then if it makes him uncomfortable and he said "WHAT! No? I just mean we need to slow down. Not stop." But he doesn't realize that I'm not getting anything. So if this all has to be slow "until marriage" is it going to get worse? How should I talk to him? It's very embarrassing to me, because I'm very shy, especially about sex. So I don't know how to approach this. Especially when he gets all Christian on me. Side note - If it is my birth control that has driven me to being a nymphomaniac, it won't be another year until it is removed. But I'm not sure if it is the cause or not. If so does anyone know a way to counter it or decrease my sex drive?Summary:
Summarize: Just like an employee who goes from part time, to full time, to management until they reach their point of incompetency, relationships go from short term, to long term, to marriage(or whatever actually goes here) until they reach their point of failure. They are often promoted based off of how good they are in current phase not how well suited they are for the next one. They then stay at this point indefinitely or until they get fired(or relationship is ended).Summary:
Summarize: Right but my point is that we don't know that it is unhealthy for dogs to do it. We just prefer them not to. How can we judge animals for certain behaviors if we do not actually understand it.Summary:
Summarize: I was wearing wedges that don't have the best of traction on them. We had gone to this super expensive/classy restaurant that had the most lovely worn down looking hardwood floors. As the greeter was leading us to our table my heel lost it's footing and I totally slipped on the floor and landed on my ass. Everyone was horrified and the room fell silent but I don't usually let shit like that bother me, the guy asked if I wanted to go home or whatever. I literally scrambled up off the floor, raised both my hands and said, "It's okay, I'm good. As y'all were!" The server was giving us the wine selection for the night and the chef's specials but I just kept trying (and failing) at keeping a straight face because I was laughing so hard at myself (PTSD-eque I'm thinking).Summary:
Summarize: The Elder Scrolls games are all single player RPGs centred around the player character... They're very much about you exploring the world on your own and discovering things while being immersed in said world, feeling like you are the first player to have done so... Not to mention your growth into being the most powerful individual around capable of fucking up everyone else's shit. That does not translate at all into an MMO by virtue of the fact that now you've got thousands of player characters running around. The exploration aspect is watered down because you're not the only player character in the world to discover it, and then everyone else is equally growing in power, so you no longer have that aspect of uniquely being this powerful motherfucker unmatched by anyone else.Summary:
Summarize: Well said, thank you. I would never tell anyone to 'get over it' when they're the target of 'humor' based on hurtful stereotypes and I would appreciate it if the same courtesy were extended to me within my own community It took me a long time to come to this same understanding, and for a long time I was one of the same sort of people who would shout, "Oh come on, get over it" etc. I realize now that that's a profoundly unfair request to make of someone, and often a hypocritical one, as we've all got our sore-spots and touchy issues. It doesn't reflect well on us when we forget that fact and get hostile with others for expressing their feelings because sooner or later we're likely to be in the same spot, and greatly resenting anyone who gets hostile and tells us that our feelings don't matter. We should recognize that it's not a transsexual becoming upset by a joke at the expense of transsexuals, but the fact that there is a strong culture of alienation marginalization and stigma attached to transsexual people in our culture that is the underlying problem here. If we work on that, then we'll end up having an awful lot fewer sentiments of offence to get upset over when transsexuals don't laugh at certain jokes that many of us may otherwise find to be both hilarious and in good humor. It takes a bit of distance from tragedy before it can be safely laughed at, after all, and that sort of distance from being treated like they belong in a freak-show is a luxury which transsexuals in our society presently do not enjoy.Summary:

Summarize: When you are on birth control, you don't have normal periods - you have a withdrawal bleed caused by a dip in hormones. Hormones, particularly estrogen, can be stored in fat. So if you have been on birth control, your body has likely stored away excess hormones in your fat cells. Now that you are losing weight, your body is breaking down fat cells and using them for energy, thereby metabolizing the stored hormones and keeping your body from having a noticeable enough drop in hormones to keep you from having a withdrawal bleed.Summary:
Summarize: I know what you mean. The last thing I want to do while driving is listen to shitty music on the radio. I don't want to wade in amongst the adds, radio "personalities", and teeny-bopper bullshit that passes as mainstream music these days, praying that the next song that receives airtime, just before I arrive at my destination, is something that I'll like. The main complaints in this thread is how people don't like the music being played by JJJ at the moment and how it was better when they played music you liked. WELL GO FUCK YOURSELF. If there is a certain type of music you like listening to, then go buy/download the albums of your favourite band and stop crying about it. In this day and age when everyone seems to have a device that'll play an mp3, I have no idea why you would bother with the radio. Hate the presenters? Go download a podcast. Hate Aussie Hip Hop? Download the music you actually like. It's not rocket surgery; it's common-fucking-sense.Summary:
Summarize: I agree with adding some more depth than that. Getting some of this drama in is fine. But I feel they have lost sight of what made Suits Suits. I think it's good they dont stick to the same pattern, it makes show become boring (look at House M.D. 80% of most episodes were pretty much the exact same build-up, despite being awesome, it got pretty annoying). But this shit's getting old, and it's only gonna get worse, I think. I'm certain Mike will break up after Rachel tells him (next ep probably), and after that Mikes probably gonna end up in some miserable slump. Maybe starts smoking weed again or something, to underline the obvious rockbottom he's hit. Rachel's probably gonna seek council with Donna, who will advise her to "give him some time" or something like that. And I think they will drag this "will they get back together or won't they?" on for a longer while than needed. And they might even decide to make it worse, because collusion happens with two people. Why not also force Harvey to patch up the broken Mike because Cahill is riding their ass with his personal vendetta, and he can't have Mike being an easy way into his bussiness in his current state.Summary:
Summarize: because it would literally be impossible for me to use that sort of terminology with fellow UK friends outside of reddit. but why iam i even engaging with you if you are such a clueless moron you think you can infer someones usual expressions and terminology patterns and their shift despite not knowing them and being complete strangers to you, then you are a grade A tit . who the fuck do you think you are that you can tell when a stranger is hamming it up purely for the medium he is using and isnt using expressions he would otherwise use in the pub describing the exact same thing. i would have no qualms in calling you a wanker or cunt to your face or on reddit. like wise i call a trollop a trollop , and i call people with bingo wings, and fag stained teeth the riff raff names they deserve.Summary:
Summarize: I just got out of a ten month relationship, I've met a new girl and we've been on a couple of dates now. Over the last couple of weeks we've opened up to each other a lot. However, she only seems to want to have one date on the weekend, and never really wants to hang out during the week when she's free. Is there any way to get her to be interested in me enough to want to step it up and want to do things more often? Or should I just give it some time? She also just got out of a long relationship, one and a half years, so I know she doesn't want to take things too fast.Summary:
Summarize: Story time! So a little backstory; I had boxed at an amateur level for roughly four years at the time of this happening, this included competing at a national level so to say I was quite skilled in the pugilistic arts would be accurate. Edit: decided to add more about me and the guy Me: 4 years of boxing at the time. 160lbs 5'10, don't know about body fat or anything but I always had a six pack so I wasn't fat. Him: don't think he had any experience in combat sports or martial arts or what have you, but he played rugby and probably outweighed me by about 30lbs at the minimum with a typical rugby player body I.e. Very thick and dense but a bit on the soft bellied side, probably an inch or two taller than me. So i was at a house party which included about 30% I already knew and the rest being made up of friends of friends, everyone was having a good time. I was stood outside the house with a group of about 5/6 guys including myself, and as guys often do when having drinks there was some friendly back and forth, banter if you will, and it would seem one fella couldn't take a joke. I don't remember specifically what it was he had said but I remember that I replied with 'nah shut the fuck up' which got a few laughs from the other guys in the group, I was stood with the guy I replied to to my right about two feet away, and out of the corner of my vision I saw he take a swing at me catching me in the mouth. I instinctively shifted my right foot back and dropped my bottle going into my boxing stance, he threw another sloppy haymaker which I rolled (ducked) under, I started throwing back straight shots in combinations, just simple stuff double jab-right straight-leading to a lead hook basic shit, and by doing this I quickly drove him back to the wall of the house. This was basically my tactic for actual matches; drive them back to the ropes and work the body and head, and this is what happened then I only threw a couple of big shots before my friends pulled me away but as soon as I stopped hitting him the dude started talking shit again which I'll admit was very annoying. We left soon after and I heard from one of my friends who was on a rugby team with this guy that when he saw him a couple of days later he still had a bruised face and split lip, the worst injury I gained from this encounter was a minor welt on the inside of my lip were it hit my teeth mid sentence, along with some sore hands.Summary:
Summarize: Honestly this last patch has been the most poorly thought out set of balance changes i've seen in a very long time. after all of the talk of melee being notoriously weaker then ranged in this game (except in the cases of tanks) riot starts nerfing melee assassins who are already performing at an average level in solo queue, and FAR below average in competitive..? what? not only are melee assassins weak in competitive play and are regularly bypassed for ranged mages in the VAST majority of games, but they are also average in solo queue. lets take a look at champions "tweaked" this patch.. Fizz: a champion who's pretty much rarely/never played professionally that literally has ONLY one function (deals damage, no hard cc, no utility, not tanky) and has an average 51% ish win rate in solo queue, gets nerfed into being completely UNPLAYABLE. this is not an exaggeration. fizz is not playable right now. Akali: a champion who is NEVER played competitively and that literally has ONLY one function (deals damage, no hard cc, no utility, not tanky) gets her range nerfed and her bread and butter burst combo outright REMOVED from the game. Zed: arguably the STRONGEST and MOST POPULAR of all the melee assassins in the game (definitely the best competitively) and who was probably deserving of an actual nerf, ends up with the most meaningless nerf out of the 3... a minor attack speed nerf, resulting in slightly less turret killing power and slightly less dps in extended fights Ahri: a RANGED champion who is REGULARLY and CONSISTANTLY played in competitive, who has a solid above average solo queue winrate, and the most options in terms of playing in any style she chooses (passive/safe wave clearing, roaming, dueling, aggressive, poking, etc) gets MULTIPLE buffs. presumably under the guise of "compensation for the removal of DFG", an item which PLENTY of champions can effectively use, and yet only ahri gets a "compensation" buff for it, as if the champion wasn't functional without it. we've all seen people use DFG and make it work on tons of champs. ahri, leblanc, syndra, fizz, katarina, lissandra, etc. now, i want to make a very clear point on this entire concept of "counterplay" that riot has been obsessed with recently. this game is about DECISION MAKING and TEAM PLAY. if you get caught alone by a zed, a fizz, an akali, or another melee assassin, you SHOULD die. there shouldnt BE counterplay unless they make a mistake or your teammates save you. why? because if a melee assassin cant outduel people in 1v1s or do more damage then a ranged champion then there is literally NO advantage/reason to play a melee champion in this game unless you're a tank. ever. as an example to point out how ridiculous the recent "balance" changes are, how does it make sense for an ahri to be able to outduel a fizz and deal similar damage in a 1v1? she has similar damage, access to hard CC, better mana costs, better AND safer wave clear, better teamfighting, a ranged auto attack for csing and harassing, better sustain, ability to siege and NEVER has to risk melee range commitment. almost every ranged mage has these advantages Another point i want to bring up is that when people complain about assassins they have a bad habit of only thinking of games where the assassin gets fed and is running over their team. what if your teammates hadnt fed him? what if he was 0/0/0? would he still be one shotting you or 2v1ing you if you were ready for it? probably not. sure, if he catches you off guard 1v1 you'd still die or have to run, but thats the whole purpose of assassins.. 9/10 times the reason an assassin is snowballing is because you have a bad teammate who misplayed and fed him. thats how this game works. it has nothing to do with the champions involved. your teammate fed someone, so that person is stronger then he should be and he takes over the game, it happens all the time, not just with assassins. you just "feel" it more when you get caught by a fed assassin because you die quickly anyway, im getting pretty tired of all of these balance changes that have been happening under the guise of "counterplay", because the majority of them dont seem to have anything to do with counterplay. it just seems to be trying to appease bad solo queue players who never group in this TEAM game and constantly get caught out alone, then blame the champions involved instead of their bad decision to be alone at the 25 min mark. also, random side note, build paths for melee damage dealers SUCK. they are almost always less efficient then the typical morello/raba/void combo that ranged mages use, or the paths ADCs use. its annoying how streamlined tank/adc/mage build paths are, while melee carry build paths are sloppy and scatteredSummary:
Summarize: One Million Moms is a religious organization that hates gays. Every week or so, they send out a notice to their mailing list subscribers to notify them of companies that support gay and lesbian rights. In the email they provide a link to contact the heads of those companies and complain. I've found this mailing list to be a fantastic way of finding out which companies are supporting gay and lesbian rights, and being able to immediately voice my support to these companies directly through the convenient link provided by One Million Moms! Recently I've used their own website to write encouraging letters of support to Oreo, DC Comics, and JC Penney for their brave stance in support of gay rights. Their link pre-fills a subject line and email body with anti-gay hate speech and boycott threats, which you can easily delete and replace with your words of encouragement! Tell these great companies that you stand with them in their support of the LGBT community and use the One Million Moms' own resources against them!Summary:
Summarize: Hello, so basically, the issue is what the title says. I just got a new ipod classic a couple months ago and put all my music on it. My hard drive crashed the other day, and I haven't been able to get anything off of it. I tried going into hidden files on my ipod and getting them through there, however, I lost about 8ish gigs of music, and had a good gig or so that weren't named (as in, they had the short, AEFIJ or whatever name that itunes usually changes over). I tried a program or two off a quick google search, but they were out of date/didn't recognize my ipod. Is there a good program that will work with a new ipod classic? Or a way to see which files aren't transferring/being named? 8 gigs isn't a huge blow by any means, but still frustrating. Thanks!Summary:
Summarize: Have a permanent scar on my dick from having too much sex. Not even joking. Here's how it went down. Had sex with my girlfriend. Afterwards, I realized the sides of my dick were kinda sore. This happens a few more times after sex and then I see the sides are a little pink. A few more sexytimes and all of a sudden, there is a tiny hole in my dickskin. After having sex, it starts to get more painful. But then we get horny again, have more sex. Did you know your pain tolerance goes up a lot during sex? The hole gets bigger. AFTER sex, I realize it is really painful. We decide to stop having sex to let it heal. But instead, we have more sex and it gets larger. We try using condoms to help or something. Nothing works. Eventually, it gets to the size of my pinky finger nail. I think eventually the pain overrode wanting to have sex because it healed, but that was a couple years ago so I don't remember. I think it was because she had shaved and had really sharp pubes? Not sure.Summary:
Summarize: Rant on: Can we PLEASE, for the love of GOD begin to teach this distinction and teach it right so we don't have this 'real doctor' bullshit argument ever again? A 'doctor' is someone who is maximally educated in their chosen field. They have received the highest amount of training possible in their field and are exceptionally qualified to be of service to their field and to contribute new findings and insights. It is a relic of the medieval educational system and as such is an anachronistic, yet accurate, title for anyone who has put in the time and effort to learn all they can about their field so they can pursue it with excellence ( mileage may vary on actual achieved excellence ) A 'physician' is a doctor (maximally educated person) of medicine who is tasked with promoting, maintaining or restoring human health. They can do amazing things like treat cancer, operate on brains and hearts, transplant healthy organs in the place of diseased ones, and write you a prescription for sweet, sweet vicodin. That the two have been conflated in the last century or so is a successful and self-conscious PR-stunt on the part of a profession that came to scientific understanding in fits and starts (see: leeches, germ theory denial, hostility to inoculation) and until the late 18th century or so was sometimes practiced as a side business by barbers.Summary:
Summarize: Coming from a long time Atheist, they're pretty spot on actually. All you people do is circle-jerk, post memes, and post Facebook screen caps of you "le trolling le christian ppl". Sorry guys, it's the truth, and a lot of people are going to downvote me because they actually think that being a hateful Atheist to a hateful Christian is going to solve something, or they just don't want to admit the fact that they're just as bad as the fundies they despise. I'll admit, I used to be like that. I would go on Facebook and avidly bash religious statuses and pictures. Then I realized that I was being a complete and total douche-fuck, and not all religious people are horrible people. So, I keep to myself now, if a religious discussion is started, I wont get involved, or I'll be polite about it. I don't force my Atheism down people's throats. Although I still don't agree with some of the things Christians and other religious groups are trying to do, like having Creationism taught in schools, but I don't yell and cuss at them for it. The main thing you people don't understand is just because some religious group is being a cunt to you, that doesn't mean you have to be one to them.Summary:
Summarize: Hi /r/CompetitiveHS, This season I made it to legend with a variation of Aggro Paladin. Unlike the traditional Aggro deck it runs 2 Piloted Shredders and a Defender of Argus. [Proof and Decklist] ( aqahUuD) The question is, are those cards worth running in a deck that plays in a style akin to face hunter? Aggro pally plays very similarly to face hunter in that its a deck which requires rushing down your opponent and forcing them to trade. Unlike face hunter, the paladin hero power and majority of its damage comes from minions. Since Hunters have a lot of burns spells, and their hero power, they don't necessarily need to have mid game board control. Paladins require a lot of minion presence in order to deal damage. Enter, Piloted Shredder and Defender of Argus. Although these cards are expensively curved, they help to protect your board from AOE. These cards are meant to help you contest your board in the mid game. Piloted Shredder is a strong 4 drop which leaves behind a minion. Argus gives your minions 1 health and 1 attack, keeping thing out of range of simple AOE such as Whirlwind or Swipe. Although there is a lot of pros with running Shredder and Argus, there is still inherent flaws. First of all, the deck now has 4 cards in the 4 mana slot. Expensive to curve into, and inefficient in the opening hand. Generally if aggro paladin loses board control in the early game it loses the game. These cards really don't help to contest the board like an consecrate. Compared to the most common 4 drop, in Aggro pally, Blessing of King gives an instant four attack buff which pushes for more damage assuming you have a minion out. So seemingly the cons outweigh the pros. The argument that could be made is that Shredder and Argus are too slow. Personally I feel like the cards are really powerful and help to maintain board presence. These cards are a tech, in this meta dominated by Warriors, Druids, and Hunters. Shredder is strong enough standalone 4 drop versus Control Warrior and Defender taunts minions against aggro and keeps them out of swipe range.Summary:
Summarize: I know this may end up being another "reddit knows balance" but the changes to veigar and morde seems to fuck their core gameplay, ie veigar laning phase and trades are all about his q, now with q being a skill shot, w as hard to hit as always (now even harder due to the changes to e) and e delay is just next level nerf... about morde they mentioned that they are going to reduce his brust, like, really? All of this started with changes in compensation about dfg removal, how are nerfs compensations, wtf... Now, i can be seeing everything wrong, maybe... id like to know if there are opinions from veigar and morde mains about the impact dfg removal had on these champs and also their opinions in these "compensations" becouse what i understand they are compensating the remove of a brust dmg core item that was built most of the time on these champs by nerfing them/changing their core gameplay (see veigar laning phase)Summary:
Summarize: I met this girl (F20) last summer, and knew she was in a somewhat serious relationship when I first met her. We became very fast friends, and now almost a year later she is solely the person I rely on and go to for all the shit that happens in my life. I know that this is wrong of me, and I have tried to stop relying on her for help so much, but with no avail. She is getting married very soon, and has asked me to attend her wedding, which I feel obligated to, but I just don't know if I can. Could it make any difference if I told her how I felt, or just do I hope my feelings go away at some point? I know I shouldn't have gotten these feelings for her, but there was no stopping it, and I don't think I could stand to lose her as my friend.Summary:
Summarize: Hi! So I wear glasses, bangs, and I guess "typical hipster" clothing, and I definitely understand your point. Basically, it's just a preference in style/personal experience, wanting to be completely independent and unique, I guess "showcase" that I'm artsy(because first impressions say a lot), and this underlying emotional reassurance that you "cracked the code" to get above society. Hang with me for a second . Popular culture is easy to find and go with, but finding joy in something underground is statisfying hard work and searching, also like a little reminder that you're not a copy of everyone else.Summary:
Summarize: Thing is, alot of oldish cars like Hondas that have a 500 KBB value are worth alot more than that for those in the Honda (or whatever) scene. For example, I paid 3500 for my 92 civic hatch with an Integra motor in it. And this was actually a pretty decent price. Don't ask me why, but that's just how it is.Summary:
Summarize: Let's see... I bought Heroes III years ago but I lost the CD and I never had the awesome expansions. I had an urge to play again recently, and having simply pirated H3 in the past (haven't had the CD in years), I wanted to see if I could pirate it again. Well, I could. It's pretty easy, actually. I found the torrent but damn, it would take almost a whole day to finish downloading. I want to play now, damnit! I did some research and lo and behold, there exists a service for old, badass games! I think it was $5-15 for the complete edition, and I couldn't resist. I was playing within the hour and I stopped torrenting the game.Summary:
Summarize: Im sorry, $170?!?!?!?! with the asurion insurance to get a new phone? HOLY FUCKING CHRIST, They really fucking rob you now a days My blackberry storm used to cost me $50 to replace everytime it shit the bed with Asurion. Then They charted me $80 to replace my Droid X because the camera button broke. I never filed a claim on my Gnex, but my sister paid $80 to have her Moto Razor X replaced (I think that was the model, claimed to be the best android battery lifed phone at the time ) after she cracked the screen.. Now they want $170 deductible? Just cancel that fucking shit, man what a rip off. I cancelled mine. All that money you pay them you could just buy a new phone, plus its water resistant and with the $20 tempered glass protector, you dont really need them anymore. Jesus, $170 to get a phone that verizon charges you $99 for is INSANESummary:
Summarize: I'm currently dating an amazing girl, but she is struggling with depression, self harm, and suicidal thoughts. She tells me that her dad won't accept that shes hurt and needs help, that she's tried to tell him different ways but he doesn't get it. He thinks shes just being over dramatic at times. I tried to sit down and talk to him about getting her help possibly through a therapist, but he said that he would have to talk to her mom and her about it and see, and that ultimately she has to look to god. It's been over a week now and she doesn't think he will ever do anything about it. I never told him that shes depressed, self harming, and occasionally taking multiple pain meds at a time to "mellow out" but I'm worried shes trying to overdose. I only told him that she is "sad" and she really needs to see a therapist, and that I wouldn't go into details with him because I didn't want to break her trust. I would've said depressed and suicidal, but he came off as offended and taken aback that I could know something about his daughter that he doesn't know. I couldn't find the way to tell him she's suicidal, he wouldn't have taken it well i'm for sure, the way he is, he would've been mad at me and her, and possibly made her go over the edge. I don't know what to do. She has cut herself for the past four nights in a row, and taken multiple pain meds to try to calm down/overdose. I go to sleep not knowing if she will wake up and text me back. It's really really hard and I need help. I tell her every day how much I love her and how i'll always be here for her. She tells me everyday is harder and harder to get up everyday, and she doesn't want to be alive anymore. She told me that i'm the only reason she still tries just a little bit (not in a clingy "I'll kill myself if you leave" but like "You mean so much to me that I haven't fully given up yet")Summary:
Summarize: OP]( Thanks to everyone who helped me out :) As I said in the comments I decided to move my stuff out the next day, I then told him to meet me in a cafe on his way back from work. I began by telling him I found something on his computer. Instantly he had expression of 'oh shit' on his face. He said 'what did you find?' I was like 'how about you tell me?' He said he didn't know. I got annoyed, like was there more than one thing etc etc. Eventually I just told him about the youtube, and some particularly disgusting things he said. He just completely shut down while I was listing all this I was just demanding an explanation and yelling why and stuff. He just shrugged and said he didn't know while looking at the table. I asked him if it was just for fun, if it made him feel better about himself. He said he didn't know. "So this is it? You have nothing to tell me. I can't be in a relationship with someone that thinks this is okay" "I don't think it's okay" "Why do you do it then? Please just tell me" I nearly lost it at this point. I was just begging for an explanation. He eventually just broke down and told me that it was like he became a different person. He told me that what I saw wasn't him. I said I was sure there was a better way to take out his anger. He just said he didn't know why he did it, and he promised he'd stop. I told him I couldn't be with someone who tells a girl she should get raped. He just started crying and begging me to forgive him. I told him it's not me he needs to apologise to. He told me he would apologise to all the people he harassed and delete his youtube account and never do it again. I expressed that I didn't even know him if he could hide this from me. I didn't know which version was the real one. I said that my stuff is already out of the flat and I had to leave. Honestly it was more difficult than I thought. He was so apologetic. I said he should get therapy but I don't know if I could forgive him even if he sorted his issues out. So that's it, I'm back at my mum's house and he's sent me a few texts but I haven't responded, I don't know what to say to him.Summary:
Summarize: My boyfriend and I are 20, and we've been dating for 11 months. I don't know what to do. I hate concerts. To not only have a hard case of ADD and social anxiety stemming from my incredibly terrible case of depression, i hate going. I like music, but I'm small. People step on me, people hit me, push me, and i cant even see anything. So a typical concert consists of me getting hit in the face, stepped on, and staring at the back of someone's shirt. I don't understand how people enjoy themselves and are dancing, and i don't. It seems weird and unnatural. And i feel depressed because everyone has a good time and i cant. My boyfriend loves concerts. The first one, i got sick. Despite me always telling him to stay, he makes me leave and he gets all sad and cries afterwards. The second time, he made me try ecstasy, and i freaked out, and again.... We left. I told him I'd be okay and for us to stay and that i just needed to sit for a bit because the crowd was scaring me, but he made me leave. Again, he cried. The third concert, i got sick, but we stayed. Mainly because i didn't tell him i was sick afterwards and left to take care of my sickness when i went to the bathroom and held the dying pain the entire time. Friday night, i got elbowed in the eye. The main guy came on, and it caused me to cry (from pain) and have a panic attack. I tried to hide it and just stay there till it passed. My boyfriend turned me around to ask if i could see; and saw me tearing up. (I cant hide my emotions. It's too difficult. ) and then he's put in a bad mood, and keeps trying to get me to leave so we can go home, while i stay put and say no. I try to dance with him, while trying to calm down, and he got so angry he starts yelling, and finally we go home. I didn't want to leave because again i fuck up. We went home and he cried because he really wanted to see the guy. Every concert we go to, he always really wants to see them. I have no interest in concerts. Even if i like that person too, i don't really care. He doesn't want to take someone else or go alone. So i go. When I feel sick, he won't stay. He makes me leave even if I can go home alone by myself so he can enjoy himself. And again i feel like shit. I try to stick it out for him, and i feel like a huge disappointment. He then starts crying and saying i need to calm down and to try to not be so negative all the time. LIKE I HAVE A CHOICE. I WISH I COULD BE HAPPY. And i finally felt alone. I feel truly alone because I thought he understood I can't just turn on my happiness. I got very depressed and suicidal and felt the need to self harm. I normally don't get that bad. Since then he has been very cold towards me but still demanding attention from me. I don't know what to do. He wants me to go to another concert in two weeks....I don't even know if we are still going. He doesn't talk, he doesn't want me to take him out or do anything fun. I am still incredibly depressed. I feel terrible. I feel worthless and a disappointment. I guess since he's at my apartment still, it's not as bad. He has his own apartment but stays at mine all the time. I'm really depressed. He's the only person besides family who knows im depressed and I can't even talk to him. People just think I'm really shy. He just wants me to comfort him, cuddle him, but does nothing for me. I'm sad too. I guess I deserve to feel this way, but I can't help but feel like things are going to end. I hate waiting around because I'd rather be dumped already and get on with the pain instead of being paranoid and waiting for it. I can't talk to him about it because he just gets depressed and cries again. I'm going home after my exams this week to get away and havent told him. And before anyone mentions I need to seek help, I've tried. I was going somewhere on campus, and they put me on 7 or 8 anti depressants that didn't work, and the last one gave me seizures. I ended up in the hospital and broke my nose. I went back and told her what happened, and she said the medication DOESNT cause it. (IT DOES.) and i went back on, only to have a seizure again, and almost bleed to death. (I called the campus nurse and she told me to let me bleed it out, after i told her I was bleeding out cups, and i eventually just called 911 before i passed out) i went a few weeks back when I heard that doctor had left, but since they had already "helped me" they can't take me again. I'm currently trying to find a doctor nearby where it'll take my insurance and is close by.Summary:
Summarize: Upvote for abortion. I am completely pro-choice, and think WAYYYY more people should have abortions. ESPECIALLY if you can't afford an abortion!!!!!! If you can't afford a $400-$500 unexpected bill for the abortion, that you (usually) have 6 weeks to come up with(the cut off for abortion is 13 weeks), HOW THE FUCK ARE YOU GOING TO RAISE A CHILD?????? Oh that's right, my taxes are going to pay for it. I dont mind, uh, yeah I fucking do. And not to mention,what kind of life are you going to give a child?? Not to mention child rearing!!! HOORAY! Yet another societal degenerate to further taint society, fill our prisons, or become a ward of the state. And since they wont have any sense of moral or upstanding upbringing, they are going to reproduce. Way sooner than they should, and the cycle repeats.... People should have to complete an application process for a BIRTH LICENSE. If you dont meet the requirements, automatic mandated abortion. Poor? Denied. Multiple felon? Denied. Still in high school, or didnt finish school? DENIED!! And don't even get me started on any religion that is against birth control! Are you fucking kidding me? Do you really think god wanted our parasitic species to produce randomly encountered offspring, that the parents don't care about and nobody wants to deal with? Serioulsy! Do the world a favor! Don't use it as birth control, but---- IF you know you arent ready for a child, and it is going to ruin your life and the child's life, ABORT! Potential father a drug addict? Loser? Doubt he's gonna be around? Tell your hormones to FUCK OFF, and do what's right. And how bad is it? I'm a male, I was the only male who stayed in the waiting room that day, surrounded by females of varying status. I figured that WAS THE LEAST I could do to put my g/f through that shit. She had to deal with the bulk of the emotional and physical stress. And yeah, it might weigh on your conscience, but do what we did. Get a pet. Im not joking even a little bit. It helped so much, and we put all our love into that pet and gave it a happy home. Ill never forget it, but I'd never take back what we did so as not to ruin 3 lives, especially 1. And for all of you girls who think "I know it's gonna be hard, but I'm gonna do it because I know I can!" Think again. The same female said that to me when it happened again, even after we used protection, and lived 400+ miles from each other. I told her she was an idiot, and I wanted no part. I told her she had no idea what she was doing, and could NOT do it alone. I told her she was biting off more than she can handle. She told me she didnt want me in the child's life, and I need do nothing. Ok!. (I was young, and didnt care..) 6 months later(post birth)- "Oh my god you have no idea how this is!!! I can't do this alone!" This was the conversation we had b/c I called her b/c I received the child support income garnishment order. Told her so. And now, a few years later, she is married, has a second child, and still can't afford it. I pay her $500 a month for MY child, and she constantly asks me for more money, because her and her husband STILL can't pay the bills. Even though they have all the nicest electronics money can buy, they are late on the electric bill... But wait!! There's more! For only 1 monthly payment of $500 you can NOT see your child! I wasn't active in my child's life for a while. A mistake, and I'll never get those precious years back. But now I'm trying, and she is refusing to let me see the child, because her husband "isn't comfortable with it," even though I'm the biological father. Guess what?!? A horrible lawsuit is about to ensue, per me... Other than me being in the child's life, nothing beneficial is going to come of this, it's only going to hurt my kid to have to go through this. Soooo, sure, go ahead, have that kid that you "think" you can handle..Summary:
Summarize: Ok so this didn't happen today but happened a few years ago! At the time of the the fuck up I was about 13 or 14 years old! This happened durning the school holidays. And I was stuck at home while my parents were at work. On that day my gran was at the house with me and as with most 13 year olds I got bored of being stuck in the house and decided to go outside and find something to occupy my tiny mind. Being a boy at that age I loved playing with fire and setting things on fire. So I had a magnifying glass and was burning holes into leaves and setting small pieces of paper alight. That soon become unsatisfactory to the arsonist inside me and wanted bigger flames. This is where things start becoming a fuck up. So I sit for a while and think how can I get bigger fires going and then a little light bulb went on. Why not take an aerosol tin of deodorant and a lighter and make a flames by spraying the aerosol onto the open flame. I run inside get my deodorant and take a lighter from the kitchen all while my gran was sleeping in the chair. I go outside and do a few bursts of flames and with the can of spray and lighter and thought it was great. Once again I got bored of it and wanted to up the excitement some more. I wonder around the garden and see and old tree, this tree was semi dead at the time and it was a sort of palm tree. So this tree was standing about 1,5m from the house so it was pretty close and was just taller than the house, if I had to guess the height I'd say about 3,5m or more. The thing about this tree is that it had weird little wooden stick things that stuck out of it. And I thought hmm that will be fun to burn. I proceed to douse one of the little wooden spikes with the deodorant, what I didn't realize about the tree was that it had like this fine "hair" ( like the hair you find on the outside of a coconut) around the trunk that ran all the way up the tree and in the process of covering the stick with the deodorant I got some on this highly flammable hair. Here's where the story heats up ( pun intended ) I set the little stick on fire and of course the flame carries to this hair around the tree and next thing I knew the fire was all the way at the top of the tree. It had climbed the tree so quickly I didn't realize what happened until I saw the smoke. Immediately a wave of panic hits me, what if the fire spreads to the house cause we have wooden fascia boards and if that catches on fire the house will be toast. Luckily the tree was still alive at the top and went leaves weren't really catching on fire but the truck was burning up quickly. So I run around the corner to fetch the hose pipe as I run around the corner with it I realize it's not going to be long enough to reach the tree and I drop it and think of another way. I run into the house with the tree still burning and get out one of my moms big Tupperware bowls and run back to the tree, all while my gran is still fast asleep. By this point the smoke is now rising quickly so I run to the pool and fill the bucket with water run back to the tree and threw the water at the flames, I repeated this action about 3 or 4 times until the fire was out. Once the fire was out I took damage control, I looked around and the house was fine but the tree was black around the back and if it wasn't dead then it would be now. Thinking I got away with this without any serious trouble I went back into the house and watched some tv. Later that evening my dad came home and I was in my room when I heard him at the front door talking to the next door neighbour. Few minutes later he came into my room to question me. Apparently the next door neighbour saw the smoke in the back yard and asked my dad if everything was fine. I came clean to the crime and showed my dad the tree. I got grounded for a month and the next day and for the rest of the week I had to go to work with my dad. Keep in mind that my dad works at a bank. If I was bored before, I was definitely bored then! The tree was removed a few years later removed because I ended up killing it!Summary:
Summarize: As a "newer hockey fan"; been following for about 3 years now. No i didn't band wagon it, I am a Bears, Cubs, and "bulls" fan. To me the disconnect lies in the "drama" that is in basketball. It lost its flavor to me. you still get some drama in football, but who gives a shit as long as you tackle and catch. Guys play with pretty bad injuries and you don't see that many Chad Johnsons/T.O.s. After playing rugby for a couple seasons (college level, thought at 27 I could play with the young kids, boy was i wrong.) I began to have a lot of respect for athletes, specifically hockey players. Rugby is like hockey in one way; you are never 100%. After practice #1, (and I'm inshape have you); something happens. Hockey players play with insane injuriesm as do many football players. Then you see these basketball players. All of them seem to have slept with a kardashian, they get carried off the court because they slipt and sprained their ankle, have 1 hour shows to tell you what team they are going to sign for, etc etc. I know i went on a tangentSummary:
Summarize: I see that you are a glass half empty type of person. Suicide rates in Austrailia are around average. Take 2008 for example. In a population of 22 million, ([Source]( there were 2190 suicides ([Source]( By any stretch of the imagination, 2190 out of 22,000,000 is an extremely tiny number. You just need to look at the whole picture to see this. There are not so many people commiting suicide. It's a really small number. This is also not a fucking UNIVERSE OF SORROW. I personally do believe suicide is a tragedy in each and every instance, but don't try to take away from the feel-good nature of this story. Look at it this way: If this guy has saved 160 people over 10 years (lets just assume that it was 2190 per year), thats 160 out of 21,900, or 0.75% - an extremely significant number, especially considering he was doing it part-time, in one location. Don't be so quick to villify my respect for this individual or to feel good about good being done in the world simply because he isn't stopping everything. Edited to fix the links.Summary:
Summarize: How DARE gay people not want straight people in gay spaces that they feel safe in all the time! Most gay folks are more than happy to have straight people come in as the OP of the thread said, but the nasty truth is, sometimes gay people just want to be around other gay people. It's not really a sex thing (although that's part of it) - its a culture thing. I mean, think of it this way: for the sake of example, let's say you're a member of Faith A, and you've been invited to visit your Faith B friend's house of worship. You're welcome to come as a guest, listen, observe, be polite, etc. In fact, most places will welcome you with open arms. But let's say that you start inviting more and more of your Faith A friends to this Faith B house of worship, because you enjoy it so much. At what point does it cease to be a space for Faith B people? There are no gay houses of worship, and the cultural centers are few and far between and usually only in major cities. For gay folks, gay bars serve this purpose - as a community center, as a place to be themselves in their culture, and yes, as a place to meet like-minded people. They're really vital. And having a drunk bachelorette party there to gawk at the sideshow really dehumanizes gays in their own space.Summary:
Summarize: Men in western culture are attracted to boobs basically because society tells us they're attractive. Even from a young age guys are bombarded with media and observation that shows breasts as sexual objects. As for how they were considered sexual in the first place, its because we go to such great lengths to cover them up. In societies where breasts are completely exposed, they're not considered sexual. In some African cultures that expose breasts, men consider thighs to be sexual because they are covered up. In strict Islamic societies, ankles, as well as other female parts, are considered obscene because they go to great lengths to cover them up. When a culture demands that women cover up some part of their body, men associate it as a forbidden fruit of the female anatomy. In nudists communities, simply walking around naked is not considered sexual, because everyone is just desensitized to it.Summary:
Summarize: Like many fuck ups this happened a While ago and I was just reminded of it and thought I would share. For some backround at the time I was in 8th grade and I went to a small school, also I was super fuckking dumb and was pretty out of shape. To the fuck up: so I had a huge crush on this 7th grader, she was a year behind me and so I never saw any thing wrong with it. Well in the 7th grade class their were two main groups of girls, one had a girl named Hayley and the other had a girl named viviana. I thought both Hayley and Viviana were hot, and talked to them very often. I started to grow closer to Viviana and started to be more flirty. At us time it was lent (I went to catholic school) and my school had a little get together every Friday, this became the place where me hungout a lot and grew very close. After a few weeks I could tell for sure she liked me two and decided I would ask her out. Me being a scared of being rejected hinted and pretty much told her I was going to ask her out the next time I saw her. She said she liked me and had wanted me to ask her for the last two weeks. So friday roles around and I get all ready to ask her and she doesn't show up to the school party. I thought she was just busy so I just hungout, next week roles around she still didn't show up. At this point dumb me thought she obviously doesn't like me and was being nice when she said she liked me back. And she had been skipping the parties because she didn't want me to ask her. So I started talking to this other girl Hayley and soon decided to ask her out and she said yes. We went out and eventually dated for a little bit but what I didnt realize was Viviana had just been busy with family problems. When she heard I started dating Hayley she hated me, I tried to say sorry and apologize but she hated my guts. Eventually me and Hayley broke up and after a but of time I tired to talk to Viviana, she would text me back and soon invited me to go to a lake with her. I thought this was a sign she had forgiven me but I was wrong. She ended up kissing another guy for half the time and rarely talked to me. After this I realized she doesn't really like me anymore and we soon stopped talking. A few days before school ended I got a long text from her friend saying she really liked me, and how I broke vivianas heart when I just jumped to another girl. Now years later everything I see her post on Instagram or I am reminded of her, and I feel terrible because I know she still probably hates me. Turns out now she is a lesbian and is struggling through depression and I can't help but feel most of not all of my fault.Summary:
Summarize: Below is a copy of [this post]( by /u/2095conash on Sun Sep 21 21:16:05 2014 UTC, as read on Sun Sep 21 21:16:24 2014 UTC. I've seen various times people talk about how the men's rights movement is against equality due to them not understanding what we're saying. Obviously there are a bunch of people that straw-man us, or refuse to listen to us, but there's nothing that we can do about that. What we can do however is choose our words so that we don't confuse people who DO take the time to listen to us to prevent them from thinking that we believe that the random equality supporting person who identifies as a feminist, no matter how misguided they may be, are the people we, as a movement, fight. One of the biggest problems that we have with arguing against feminism is if you would, people 'pull out' the dictionary, whether this tactic is logically valid or not doesn't change that it gets to the core of one of our biggest misunderstandings, what WE mean when we say 'feminism' is MUCH different than what most people mean when they say feminism. It doesn't matter which is 'right' because with this big communication gap we can't even BEGIN to discuss who is right. It's like, if we assume all apples are red, if they believe that 'purple' means red (so they think apples are purple), and we believe that 'green' means red (so we think apples are green), we argue that green is the best color in the world, they argue that purple is the best color in the world, but because we aren't communicating properly it isn't revealed that we're BOTH saying that red is the best color. I recognize how the metaphor does not mirror this situation, it was merely to demonstrate the difficulties that arise from two parties that don't understand what the other is saying due to a lack of communication. Now, we can't really expect them to start clarifying their statements since one of the reasons for our general conflict with 'feminists' (as individuals) is because both sides generally write away the other side's definition as something that doesn't matter. From what I've seen, they do it because they think that ours isn't real, it's wrong, or whatever, and we do it because 100 people sitting around at computers talking about how equality is good don't matter even 1/10th as much as someone getting an anti-equality law passed. So if we want to be able to communicate and be better understood, the burden is on us really as the side the acknowledges both definitions. Now, I recognize that we have used terms like 'radical feminist', but I don't think that is clear enough, because that suggests that some teenage girl who wants to kill all men who no one listens to is who we're upset about, rather than someone who is heard and talks about how men shouldn't hit women (instead of people shouldn't hit people, which does include men shouldn't hit women so such a discussion isn't anti-equality but is misguided). I personally think that we should start using terms LIKE (feel free to suggest alternatives) 'ideological feminist' and 'movement feminist'. In this we'd be against 'movement feminists' or 'movement feminism', the people who have and use the power of the movement, the money of the movement, the image of the movement, or such. While 'ideological' feminists would be more of the type who have opinions, and maybe they talk about them, but they aren't really 'big', they don't have a 'wide scale' effect (while masses of ideologicals DO have a 'wide impact' on the image, money, or other resources of the movement, I generally feel that those are the sorta things that every individual of every movement contributes a tiny percent of those merely by having the label). I know that there are many of you here who are of the belief that feminism is built upon inherently sexist beliefs, so don't think that I'm saying that all ideological feminists are pro-equality but recognizing there are a lot of moderate ideological feminists is something that we can do to have people listen to us about the radical movement feminists, and at the end of the day, it's those radical movement feminists that lead to children having 'the glass ceiling', 'the pay gap', and all sorts of those things beaten into them with no alternate view. The major problem when our only clarifying terms are 'radical' and 'moderate' are that the moderates think the radicals are only ideological feminists, when a disproportionate amount of movement feminists are radical. Obviously you can further clarify by using both radical/moderate and ideological/movement together, but I recognize that's a bit of a slippery slope to much longer identifiers.... But those are just my thoughts, what do you all think? Anyone have any better suggestions for the terms? Any arguments against 'clarifying' what we're saying by adding one or two words here and there? I apologize for my verbose nature and if any of you feel this thread to have been a waste of your time. I thank you very much for your time and hope you have a nice day!Summary:
Summarize: EDIT - Just got into a fender bender... HA - what luck. This is why you don't talk of inauspicious things. i was driving home from college a few years ago. i was physically exhausted - had class, then work, then a 2.5 hr drive to my mom's house. and i was mentally exhausted - i was being harassed by a guy at work, i was going home to break up with my then-boyfriend, and i had started to see a guy up at college - all stressful shit. my friend is meeting me halfway, luckily - she offered b/c she REALLY wanted to see me, and i didn't fee like driving that far. i had just gotten off the phone with her, and started mulling over shit on my head...when all of a sudden i'm veering toward the median of the highway. the road was slick, and i over-corrected the wheel, which caused a lock up of the wheels i guess, and i started to spin. i'm slamming on the brakes, obviously..i finally stopped on the other side of the road, in a ditch, facing on-coming traffic. i get out, survey the damage - i hit a mile marker, which skidded across the hood, leaving a big gouge, and the impact of the mile marker on my headlight literally blasted the entire light out of the socket. it was gone. i found out later i also lost the cover that goes under the front of the car. ( fun fact - i had 3 accidents with that particular car, all in the exact same spot, the front/driver's side wheel well area) i call my friend - she tells me to get in the car, keep driving, she's 20 minutes away. and i do. its not until later when i'm taking some stuff out of my car that i realize that i could have just killed myself driving - or someone else. what made me realize this? i have a rubber duck on my dash. i found it in my backseat, under my seat, after the crash. i imagined it flying around, final destination style. and i was like - whoa. =) i keep that duck on my dash now because it reminds me of my almost fatal accident. and that if i'm tired fucking pull over!Summary:

Summarize: When regarding class depth, try not to think of PvP like other MMOs. In other MMOs you have a myriad of abilities, traits and skills. However there are so many of them that are never used at all. Instead, think of GW2 more like that of a MOBA's skill system. No one complains about League of Legends having too few abilities, because with fewer variables, execution becomes far more important. If you've played a MOBA like LoL, consider this, you have 3 abilities, an ultimate, and 2 summoner skills. In GW2, you have 5 abilities, 4 summoner skills (one of which is always a heal), and an ultimate. Your first five abilities are dependent on your weapon, I'm sure you've read. Think of each weapon as a different character from League, allowing you to swap between two.Summary:
Summarize: Hey, everyone. I'm currently a broadcasting major with a concentration in TV/Film production at one of the top broadcasting schools in the country, Western Kentucky University, but I really want to work my way into audio engineering. At this point, I'm completely open to going into either music, TV, or any other media, really. I work at the PBS station on campus, and the most experience I can get in audio there is setting up audio rigs and monitoring levels for various shoots, events, and basketball/football games, but I want to do so much more! I didn't come to WKU because of audio, but I've fallen in love with it recently. Now I'm starting to wish I'd gone to Belmont in Nashville, where they have an actual Audio Engineering program. Problem is that it's twice the tuition. Transferring is tempting, but the money and amount of hours I would have wasted is a major setback.Summary:

Summarize: My boyfriend and I are 20, and we've been dating for 11 months. I don't know what to do. I hate concerts. To not only have a hard case of ADD and social anxiety stemming from my incredibly terrible case of depression, i hate going. I like music, but I'm small. People step on me, people hit me, push me, and i cant even see anything. So a typical concert consists of me getting hit in the face, stepped on, and staring at the back of someone's shirt. I don't understand how people enjoy themselves and are dancing, and i don't. It seems weird and unnatural. And i feel depressed because everyone has a good time and i cant. My boyfriend loves concerts. The first one, i got sick. Despite me always telling him to stay, he makes me leave and he gets all sad and cries afterwards. The second time, he made me try ecstasy, and i freaked out, and again.... We left. I told him I'd be okay and for us to stay and that i just needed to sit for a bit because the crowd was scaring me, but he made me leave. Again, he cried. The third concert, i got sick, but we stayed. Mainly because i didn't tell him i was sick afterwards and left to take care of my sickness when i went to the bathroom and held the dying pain the entire time. Friday night, i got elbowed in the eye. The main guy came on, and it caused me to cry (from pain) and have a panic attack. I tried to hide it and just stay there till it passed. My boyfriend turned me around to ask if i could see; and saw me tearing up. (I cant hide my emotions. It's too difficult. ) and then he's put in a bad mood, and keeps trying to get me to leave so we can go home, while i stay put and say no. I try to dance with him, while trying to calm down, and he got so angry he starts yelling, and finally we go home. I didn't want to leave because again i fuck up. We went home and he cried because he really wanted to see the guy. Every concert we go to, he always really wants to see them. I have no interest in concerts. Even if i like that person too, i don't really care. He doesn't want to take someone else or go alone. So i go. When I feel sick, he won't stay. He makes me leave even if I can go home alone by myself so he can enjoy himself. And again i feel like shit. I try to stick it out for him, and i feel like a huge disappointment. He then starts crying and saying i need to calm down and to try to not be so negative all the time. LIKE I HAVE A CHOICE. I WISH I COULD BE HAPPY. And i finally felt alone. I feel truly alone because I thought he understood I can't just turn on my happiness. I got very depressed and suicidal and felt the need to self harm. I normally don't get that bad. Since then he has been very cold towards me but still demanding attention from me. I don't know what to do. He wants me to go to another concert in two weeks....I don't even know if we are still going. He doesn't talk, he doesn't want me to take him out or do anything fun. I am still incredibly depressed. I feel terrible. I feel worthless and a disappointment. I guess since he's at my apartment still, it's not as bad. He has his own apartment but stays at mine all the time. I'm really depressed. He's the only person besides family who knows im depressed and I can't even talk to him. People just think I'm really shy. He just wants me to comfort him, cuddle him, but does nothing for me. I'm sad too. I guess I deserve to feel this way, but I can't help but feel like things are going to end. I hate waiting around because I'd rather be dumped already and get on with the pain instead of being paranoid and waiting for it. I can't talk to him about it because he just gets depressed and cries again. I'm going home after my exams this week to get away and havent told him. And before anyone mentions I need to seek help, I've tried. I was going somewhere on campus, and they put me on 7 or 8 anti depressants that didn't work, and the last one gave me seizures. I ended up in the hospital and broke my nose. I went back and told her what happened, and she said the medication DOESNT cause it. (IT DOES.) and i went back on, only to have a seizure again, and almost bleed to death. (I called the campus nurse and she told me to let me bleed it out, after i told her I was bleeding out cups, and i eventually just called 911 before i passed out) i went a few weeks back when I heard that doctor had left, but since they had already "helped me" they can't take me again. I'm currently trying to find a doctor nearby where it'll take my insurance and is close by.Summary:

Summarize: Every year since about the 6th grade, i've gone to our little town fair. It use to be in the mall parking lot, huge, well kept, polite staff and always busy for the week or so it was here. But the last 2 years it's been rather small and kinda shady, rude staff, moved to a smaller empty lot behind our local outback. This year my boyfriend took me, as a little I'm sorry were not going to prom. We're walking around for a little while, it's still pretty early in the day so it seems mostly like little kids and their parents are there. Him and I decide we're going to ride the bull, something I've done quiet a few times growing up going to rodeos. This was his first time, I paid for him and begged him to do it with me, I explain what he has to do, how he cant hold it with two hands and what not, and he does well for his first time, on for about 15 seconds at full speed and shaking. Now it's my turn, I hop on and ride with no issue, I'm wearing skinny jeans so i'm not entirely shocked when I get a wolf whistle about the little bit of lace that got flashed on one turn around, thinking it was my boyfriend. I get off and walk back up to him, dizzy, and a carny comes up and tell's me I was one of the longest riders in this town. I quickly thank him and give a big proud smile holding on to my boyfriend. He quickly pulls me away to the carousel and leans down to kiss me, and I stand up on my tip toes to reach. The same carny apparently works this ride, comes up to us and in the most sarcastic tone possible goes "Aw aren't you cute" keep in mind, this guy is probably about 30, and smells like weed, mixed with fair food. He looks at my boy friend and goes "But maybe she deserves someone a little better fit for her, or at least know's how to ride a bull." I pull my boyfriend out of line, pissed off and grossed out. He tells me well go back when that guys not there, we walk around some more and get some treats and ride some other things. Probably about an hour later we head back to the carousel, i'm carrying my big stuffed koala bear and we get back in line. No sign of creepy carny, we get our wrist bands scanned and get on. I sit on the outside while my boyfriend sits on the middle horse. Rides going, and suddenly creepy carny is back, he hops on quickly, and holds onto the pole my horse is attached to. He just stares at me for a bit until I go "can I help you?" My boyfriend is watching slightly amused, i'm not something to be messed with and he knows as much. The carny looks at me gross yellow teeth stretched out in a grin and goes "Yeah how bout you show me some more of that lace and i'll get you a bigger bear than that sad thing." I'm completely disgusted and creeped out. I tell him to fuck off before I call the cops, but he's not getting the message, until the ride stops and my boyfriend stands up. He towers over this guy and goes "she said fuck off, or i'll have the cops here in two minutes." Creppy carny buggers off and follows around the rest of the night, until i'm so freaked out we have to leave.Summary:
Summarize: This sounds counter-intuitive, but helped me stop biting my nails after almost 20 years. Start by biting only your left (or right) Whenever you feel the urge just bite the fingers on that one hand. With time the other hand's nails will grow. Then slowly lower the number of fingers on your biting hand that you are allowed to bite. Eventually having a shorter nail will feel more out of place than a longer nail.Summary:
Summarize: Hate to burst the bubble but I ran a glass shop that's still going, been there since the 60's in NY and we regularly purchased Indian/China hand pipes. (yuk I know, forgive me ) Unfortunately I did not have the power to make the final call on all store purchases and we had pieces from 15k to under a dollar and this was back in 2000. The owners reasoning is, "why not have people buy them from us vs the gas stations (when that is what they are going to buy anyway) and maybe we can convince em to buy better". But I digress, the gentlemen whom we bought them from were both Indian, and had been selling them to the shop for longer than I had been alive at the time (I'm now in my mid 30's). He had told us many times in his stoned rambling (we would smoke in the boss's office) about how they (both his family and the majority of those in his town) had been blowing glass since the 30's and they made cheap touristy trinkets but changed em over to pipes in the late 60's and early 70's (due to the massive influx of hippies and Beatles fans some one prob taught em then too) and he would bring them over by the case and travel around and sell them at concerts and to gas stations and head shops. Back then you had to ask for an "under the counter deal" or know the owners of the store vs now they are in their own cases at every single one...Summary:
Summarize: Field report. I was at a Coachella after party, there was a good looking Latina sitting by herself, she looked in my eyes, I held gaze confidently, she broke eye contact quickly. I then immediately walked up to you and asked her name. It's Spanish, the accent makes it hard to make out the first two times, but I get it quickly. After extremely brief talking, I take her hand and walk to the dance floor. Not forceful, but with purpose. She follows, good dancing, taking her hands and putting them around me she effortlessly continues the motion as if it were her own. She spins from time to time, giving me her front then her back. I give her a look. Go in for a medium speed kiss, light hesitation, so I stop her and just kissed the corner of her mouth. My friend then comes in saying its time to go. So I get her details, texted myself from her phone, completing the circuit. All while still dancing with her. Set up date for karaoke tomorrow. Turns out that's what's she's into. No problem, I have a number of songs I can sing in any karaoke situation. Best part is, I know she's down, it's just a matter of playing my role correctly. Like acting in a play, only certain actions will render specific results. If I keep her interested by whatever means, the end goal is to make it known you want to fuck. Hints are ok, actually forcing it is not. I still focus on only having a good time no matter what, but make sure when necessary to declare my intents. You can be as cool you want to be, don't make things personal. So anyways she has a great body, great energy, a very fun human being, and I am excited to see her naked :) Both single, both vibing each other, good close chemistry, she does that Latina girl thing...you know where they're Latina in their motions. All around a good situation to bring on. She's seven years older than me and I think she'll do weird things to my dick, which is cool. Could always be better, we can always do better, but this was an important step.Summary:
Summarize: For what it's worth: I lost 70lbs over 6 months doing keto. I didn't track a damn thing, was lax on the weekends (beer), and straight up spat in the diet's face by occasionally eating ice cream or other indulgences. I had been fat all my life, and even though I was restricting the types of foods I ate it wasn't nearly as stressful as your method sounds. Eat meat, dairy, vegetables, tree nuts, and (some) fruits. Avoid bread, rice, sugary things, etc. Piss on some ketostix until you're in keto, carry on, then check again every once in a while. Power through the plateaus. You'll be fine.Summary:
Summarize: Well for starters your hair will be minging as fuck. I've read your's and other people's comments and I'll just say that you're not washing your hair properly. As your hair gets dirtier and as you get a build up of products (if you use any) you are creating a barrier on your hair, shampoo removes said dirt and product build up thus removing any barriers on your hair. The reason as to why you're developing a curl is because there are coils in your hair that can be manipulated to change the shape of your hair temporarily (like using straighteners/hair iron or curling tongs), these coils can be reset by washing the hair with water and shampoo. I will assume that you've developed a curl because of your sweat that's lead to the manipulation to the coils and because you are not properly washing your hair the barrier that's now covering your hair is preventing the coils from reverting back to their natural state. I like you have naturally straight hair and once I was at the gym working out, I built up a big sweat and when I finished I put on a hat to walk home in since it was cold out. When I got home from the gym and was preparing to go for a shower I took off the hat to find that my hair had become wavy, this is something that doesn't usually happen as my hair is naturally poker straight. I'll also note that the reason most people find that they no longer have dandruff when they stop shampooing their hair is because the dead skin is not being shifted off the skin by the shampoo and thus the dead skin is building up on their scalp. You don't have to wash your hair everyday, in fact it's not good for your hair if you wash it every day since doing so rids your hair of it's natural oils. It's best to wash your hair every 2-3 days as to not rid your hair of it's natural oils but also keeping it clean in the process.Summary:
Summarize: The worst in person was my own. We were playing futsal (basically miniature indoor soccer) and the other team was likely on steroids. Seriously there is no way they could have been as ripped as they were without some sort of performance drugs... Anyways, we're getting fucking clobbered so I'm playing as hard as I can. I go for an epic jumping header to meet a beautifully lobbed ball at the top of the box. Instead of punching the ball out of the space, the goalie instead punched my shoulder-- hard. Hard enough that I spin like a propeller through the air and land on the opposite side of my head. Immediately I get up and walk over the the bench. I shrug my shoulder the slightest bit and feel this excruciating wave of heat and pain. I put my hand up to feel my collarbone and I can feel a shard of bone pointing up barely contained inside my skin.Summary:
Summarize: Teee heeee endless circlejerk! I LOVE YOU REDDIT.

Summarize: It's sad because you can see how fractures he his. DUDE. you are not realizing the depth of Love at all. Love is not Edward Bernays derived Starbucks and McDonald's. Long-term relationships and marriage are not free of conflict and floating-cloud heaven. They are strong, and positive in a deeper way.

"Love itself is a pain, you might say -- the pain of being truly alive."Summary:
Summarize: My mother is trying to create her site on Wordpress and is having a shit-ton of issues getting started. She's not computer illiterate, but she can't grasp some of the fundamentals (like unzipping files, locating stuff on her computer, many of the terms [FTP for a start]) so all the online tutorials she's tried to follow have gone over her head. She tried hiring a techie to get her going, but that person took her money and ran, so now she's reluctant to give hired help another chance. I'm not much help because my site-building expertise doesn't extend far beyond basic HTML and a smattering of CSS. What resource(s) can I point her to? I'm getting tired of trudging over to her PC every ten minutes only to disappoint her when I can't magically fix her problems. If there are any details I can provide to help narrow down where I can start, I'll be happy to do so. I just want her to be able to get her site up and running. This has been going on for over six months.Summary:
Summarize: Look, the way I see it, the government shouldn't make it easy or hard for anyone to make money. The occupiers and I have this in common. Where we differ is that I don't believe that there's a big corruption conspiracy that makes it easier for the rich to stay richer. Sure, if you're born to a rich family you have a huge leg up, but family money doesn't last forever, and eventually you'll get a granddaughter like that kardashian bitch who'll spend it all and then bam. Even field. I just want the occupiers to focus less on "give us their money" and more on "don't take money from anyone" which is the only way to have true equality in this country.Summary:
Summarize: With the death of the big NZB providers, and the increase in availability of content on streaming services, has anyone ever considered ditching their Usenet/Hard Drive system to opt for a streaming system (Roku, ATV etc)? Given that the cost of one decent usenet subscription plus, say, 3 decent sources is roughly the equivalent of subscribing to two streaming services (netflix & crunchyroll would be my choices).

Summarize: I've been depressed my entire life, and I'm currently in a very shit spot where everything is joyless and I don't give a fuck about anything. I wrote a longer post about things here: Normally I stay awake half the night with anxiety and other thoughts/worries, but now I haven't slept at all for two days. This is the second day I've taken off work without calling in, and I'm trying to get myself back to the point of going in and facing the music. I don't care if I get canned or not, but I realize that doing so would be bad for me and the people I work with (primarily my dad). I've been coping by using alcohol for years, and I'm seriously concerned it's going to kill me. Since the beginning of the year I've been getting drunk almost every night and it's butchering my bank account. However, it's the only thing (other than drugs) that lets me feel other emotions and gives me a way to not give a fuck about everything I'm procrastinating on. It lets me feel numb about how I'm letting myself and everyone else down. I need other alternatives. I've seen a counselor but talking hasn't really helped, and the last antidepressant I was on was Effexor which did nothing, even though the side/withdrawal effects were totally fucked. I can identify self-defeating or self-destructive behaviour, but I having serious problems stopping or preventing it. I don't want to die. What else can I do?Summary:
Summarize: Freshman year- My Gf and I had been out most if the night at a friends apartment making weed butter and then a bunch of edibles. Between all the butter that had gotten on us while we cooked and all the edibles we ate we are both sky high. We get back to my on campus apartment, nobody's home. My three roommates all stumble in loudly about 30 mins later drunk as hell, they had been a some party. We are sharing the stories of our nights when we suddenly hear a shriek from outside. We are all fucked up so none of us really react until we hear a girl running down our hall screaming "help help!" Me and my four roommates all rush outside, my gf and a couple other girls stay behind in the room. We get in the hall and this panicked girl is just sayin"upstairs upstairs please you guys have to do help!" We are all way too fucked up to know what to do so we all just bolt for the stairs and run up to the third floor. We throw open the door to the hall to just see the walls covered in blood. Like fucking everywhere in HUGE streaks across the walls and big semi-soaked in puddles on the carpet. Despite being high as shit I am the most sober one of the four of us so i took the lead and ran towards this writhing body on the ground, then notice there is a girl crying hysterically nearbye and some shirtless dude holding her. This kid we all knew is just in a heap on the floor, he has this massive gash on his head that is just hemorrhaging blood and there is this huge rock like two feet to his left covered in blood. So I grab the kid and using what training I can remember while I'm so fucked up my roommates and I try to to talk to him and carefully rolled him onto his back. Although the whole time he keeps trying to sit up and grab at the rock while making this just like guttural moan. " Jack (not his real name) what's going on?" "Unnnnnggggg" "Jack come on dude speak to me what the fuck happened." "Unnnnngggggg" roommates:"Steve what do we do?!?" "Shit, well if he can't communicate we don't have a choice call 911" (bear in mind we all liked this kid and new that if we called the paramedics and cops this would be it for him at school) roommates look at me hesitantly but say" alright FUCK" So roommate A runs off to call for help while B,C, and I try to piece together what's happening while stopping the blood from gushing out of jacks head. Shirtless dude" we were watching a movie and suddenly we hear a knock on the door, Girl went to answer it and as soon as she opened the door this crazy fucker just decked her in the face!" Although he didn't elaborate more we were never sure how much of the damage on jacks body was dealt by shirtless guy but I have no doubt it was more than a little. While he is telling this to roommate C I am looking jack over and that's when I look in his eyes to see they were dark red and had pupils the size of dimes" FUCKING SHIT! He's high out of his god damned mind!" Turns out elsewhere on campus earlier that night jack had eaten several candies laced with LSD and was tripping his balls off. So anyway at around that point two cops, one of which I had a bit of a history with suddenly burst into the hallway guns drawn. We all throw our hands up as we are being aimed at and so jacks head starts gushing more blood. "What the fuck is going on?!" Dick cop yells "Don't shoot! We found him like this, he needs attention now! Also I think he's on drugs because he is completely nonresponsive, and keeps trying to hit himself with that rock!" I shouted gesturing to the big bloody stone. The cops thankfully lowered their guns and holstered them but then dick cop pulls out his taser and starts threatening jack with it ordering him to get down and comply or be tased. Roommates B,C,and Start yelling" No STOP! He doesn't understand what your saying let us just hold him down he's fine he just needs medical attention!" "Back away from him NOW!" So we all stood up, pretty well covered in blood, and did as he said. Jack pulled himself towards the wall and leaned against it but roommate B grabbed the rock and moved it away from Jack, who still kept reaching for it and the cop kept threatening to taze him if he kept moving, not that jack understood. Eventually the paramedics arrived and carted away Jack, and treat the girl who got a huge black eye. Never heard from jack again personally but B did and he said that according to Jack he had no recollection of how he wound up in our building or why he punched the Girl, but that he kept hitting himself with the rock because he saw it as his brain and was scared if he didn't get it back into his head he would die. So ya that was the craziest thing I saw in college although I do have some other good stories as well. Always remember kids, drugs can be fun, but they can also be very very VERY dangerous.

Summarize: Sorry this is going to be a bit long, but stick with me. I don't know much about cars, and even less with the laws surrounding them. I originally crossed into canada to visit my then girlfriend/now Wife, and ended up staying and getting permanent resident status. I couldn't work or go to school for quite some time, so my vehicle just sat around. Now I want to drive it for school and work and need to import/register it in Ontario, but can't legally drive it. I can't get special plates from Ontario because it needs border inspection, which I need to drive it to to get, and it's an hour away so I'm afraid towing will cost a ton. I'm very frustrated and it's old anyway, so I'm thinking of selling it to someone else or for scrap and just getting a new vehicle, can I even legally do that in my current situation?Summary:
Summarize: During high school, my friends and I used to play paintball in the woods. We wore old clothing to play and look liked a wild pack of bum kids. So one day we all gathered up our loose change and go to Checkers. We ended up going going to a Checkers located in the ghettos. Weve been to that ones of times and never gotten any shit. So we park, order our food and sit down and wait for our meal outside. There was a couple arguing not too far from us. We paid no attention to them. Our food was done and we start eating. The guy that was arguing with his girl came up to us and said "YO!". We stayed quite. "YALL GOT DRANKS?!". I look at him and say "...no". He immediately went to reach for something behind his back and at the same time all of us were about to get up and gtfo thinking we were gonna get shot. He actually pulled out a wad of money and said "I GOT YALL NIGGAAAAAAAAAS" and bought us fucking drinks.Summary:

Summarize: When you are on birth control, you don't have normal periods - you have a withdrawal bleed caused by a dip in hormones. Hormones, particularly estrogen, can be stored in fat. So if you have been on birth control, your body has likely stored away excess hormones in your fat cells. Now that you are losing weight, your body is breaking down fat cells and using them for energy, thereby metabolizing the stored hormones and keeping your body from having a noticeable enough drop in hormones to keep you from having a withdrawal bleed.Summary:
Summarize: While the changes also seem a bit excessive to me, I think the intentions are good(Plat 2 ADC main and I FUCKING HATE PANTHEON). Its in line with how they are treating long range ults as a whole(TF, Noc etc.). The problem is 100% the lack of counter play to Pantheons post 6 play. It just too face roll to press R from across the map and double kill bot lane. I think they should remove all changes except the ult range. This will allow lanes to ward appropriately to prevent him from ganking, but still allow him to punish lanes that don't invest the resources in vision.Summary:
Summarize: I was 25 at the time and had divorced a few months prior. After my divorce I went into full manwhore mode. I'm a decent looking dude, 6'1", 205#, dirty blonde hair, blue eyes, I'm no gym rat but I have a job that keeps me active all day and in good shape. I'm 3rd wheeling it at a bar with my friend and his GF. We are getting shitty drunk (an every night thing for me at the time) and his GF says "I think my friend is coming to hang out with us." Cool, the more the merrier. About 20 minutes later her friend shows up. We will call her T, for the sake of anonymity. T is about 5"2 in heels, 100#, fiery green eyes, and a strawberry blonde. She was a solid 8.5 on a 10 scale when sober. In my condition she looked like an eleventeen. She orders up a vodka and red bull, and I exchange my empty beer for a fresh one. All 4 of us are chatting and laughing. And I noticed she touched my arm when she laughed...always a good sign. By the end of that round my friend and his GF wanted to shoot some pool. They get up to go grab a rack of balls and pick out some cues. As they left the table she leaned over, put her hand in my crotch and started rubbing my dick. She looks me in the eyes and smirks. "Follow me". Being the gentleman I am I oblige without question. She grabs her purse and leads me to the women's bathroom. Well by this time the fuckstick is at full mast and we go into the handicap stall. I close the door and lock it and she sits down on the toilet. I walk over and she unbuckles my belt, unbuttons my jeans, pulls down my boxers and starts giving me some violent head. She is deep throating and gagging. Spitting on my dick and jerking with the fervor of a porn starlet. She has my undivided attention. She pulls my member out of her mouth and asks if I have a condom as she continues stroking my crank. FUCK! "Nope, but I can go get one." She reaches for her purse sitting on the railing and fishes one out. Perfect! She hikes up her dress and pulls off her lacy little black thong to reveal a beautiful slick shaven pussy with a finger-width landing strip. She throws the soaked panties in her purse. She stands up, turns around and has one foot on the floor and her knee on the toilet seat. There, in all of its glistening glory, was my perfectly presented prize. I push myself into her and she starts cooing. I'm in awe that I'm full on fucking some woman that I've known for the course of a beer...fuck it. Trim is trim, and I'm in. I'm balls deep in T and rage fucking this girl. Balls slapping clit, she's moaning, and the rougher I get the more she soaks my rod and wails. She's a screamer. I give zero fucks at this moment. I hear the bathroom door opening and closing, toilets flushing, hand dryers cycling on and off...it doesn't phase me one bit. At times I hear women's voices...not T's and some are whispering, some laughing...I don't pay attention or acknowledge their words. I am completely zoned in on fucking the living shit out of T. It could have been two minutes since we began, it could have been an hour. Time was lost to me at this point and in my condition. She's moaning and screaming to god...there is no god here, only a sexually explosive man in the throes of a post divorce, self serving, fuckstravaganza. She lunges forward as I feel myself crashing into her cervix...she is trembling and shaking and tells me she wants me to come in her mouth. "Turn around". I rip off the condom dripping with her juices and shove my lube and precum covered dick into her mouth. She starts bobbing her head and fiddling with my balls...wham! I come like the fury of 1000 badgers spun out on crank, deep in her throat. She half chokes, half coughs, and the next wave of semen comes pouring from my member into her mouth. She continues to stroke me and squeeze my throbbing dick and coax every last drop from me. "Fuck yes! Let's get a drink and go shoot some pool!" She said through smiling lips, my once erect member shrinking in her hand. I pull up my boxers and my jeans as she takes a quick piss. She dries off and stands up. "I'm not putting my panties back on, they're soaked and I would just have to take them off again when we get home in a while." I wash my hands and as we exit the women's bathroom. There stands my buddy with a full on shit-eating grin, his girlfriend, and half a bar-full of strangers. My buddy hi-fives me and everyone is laughing cheering and clapping. I exclaim "who needs a beer? I need a smoke!" T was smiling and laughing, she wasn't embarrassed in the least. We stayed at that bar until closing. I got my tab for the night and it was only 12 bucks. The bartender said that a bunch of people were paying for my beers all night. And that I better not pull that shit again in his place. Fair enough. T and I were fuck buddies for a while but that all ended when she caught up to me at the same bar and I was with another woman. She got pissed and dramatic, and went completely left when I reminded her that told her I didn't want anything exclusive.Summary:
Summarize: Thinking about picking up an xbox one tomorrow and my other half has issues with kinect being always on (she's been reading the propaganda). I'm really interested in the voice control aspect on kinect, especially the "record that" function and was wondering if those that already have one know if it's possible to turn the camera off but leave the mic on? The only thing I could find online was saying that the opposite was possible i.e. Mic off, camera on.Summary:
Summarize: Edit: sorry about the typo in the title. My girlfriend and I have been together for about 3.5 months. We’ve known each other for just over double that after meeting while she was with her ex-boyfriend of 5 years. I immediately liked her, as she appeared to be everything I saw in a partner/wife, but I had resigned to the fact I would never be with her because she was with her ex-boyfriend. She ended up ending breaking up with him and a few weeks later we got together. In hindsight, it probably would have been better if she had been out of a relationship for longer before we got together. Her ex-boyfriend is having a hard time letting her go. He emails and texts her almost daily about changes he has made bnout things my girlfriend would have preferred he did/like, for example, drinking coffee. My girlfriend doesn’t appear to encourage him and tells me most of times he has contacted her. While we’ve only been together a short period of time, we both agree that it has felt longer than that as we text each other all day most days, go on at least one date a week and stay overnight when we can. Maybe, it has all been too much too soon. This past week I stayed at her house on Saturday and Sunday (23 and 24/3), Tuesday, 26/3 and Thursday to Sunday nights (28 to 31/3). I was supposed to stay at her house tonight as well but I decided to go home. Most of the time we have an awesome time together - we flirt, laugh, kiss and have fun and generally enjoy spending time together, even while doing nothing in particular. However, this past week negative things have come up that have made us question continuing our relationship: While we were having sex it seemed she wasn't particularly enjoying herself. I asked her why and while she was reluctant to tell me I assured her I preferred honesty even if it was bad. She told me that a large part of her being turned on was feeling a heavy man on top of her. I'm within 10kg of her weight. I've lost more 20kg over the last two years through diet and exercise. I like how I look now, but she thinks I'm too skinny. Her ex-boyfriend weighs what I used to weigh. Hearing her say that my 'skinniness' was a turn off, turned me off, but I thought we could get past tha The next day, before we had a nap I said to her as a throwaway line, "I am undecided as to whether I like your boobs." My girlfriend's breasts aren't all natural. They also happen to be the same size as my ex-girlfriend's natrual breats. I am not sure what I was thinking saying that line, my only excuse is I was quite tired. I really do like her breasts, the vast majority of the time. The only time I don't prefer them is when she stands up naked, as they sit extremely perky on her chest, and I think I prefer less perky based on what I'm used to. The next day when we were making out and I was sucking on her nipples my girlfriend commented that since I said that line, anything I've done to her breasts has turned her off. I explained that I said that because they're different to what I am used to. She responded that next time I toucher her boobs she'll be thinking about my ex-girlfriend. Understandably, she got upset, as she had her reasons for getting new breasts, which relates to two negative incidents in her past that she has told me about. They're horrible things that I wish did not happen to her or anyone. She has said a few times since that she things they're too much baggage for me to accept and still want to be with her. In a way, it almost feels like she is challenging me to break up with her. That in turn makes me feel like there is something wrong with me for wanting her but if I don't stay with her we will have failed. Based on these things, I'm not sure if we'll feel comfortable having sex with each other again or if there is any point continuing an emotional connection. I know I'll be wondering if she is enjoying herself or what she is thinking. I'm not sure how we can go about fixing this, or if that is possible. So I seek your advice reddit...Summary:
Summarize: I had broken up with my ex a few weeks prior to this event. So anyway, I ended up at this party and got completely hammered, the ex was also there and tells me how her brother wants to beat my ass down, her brother was a big buff guy of age 19, when I was 16. I was feeling ballsy and dared her to call him and thought nothing of it for the rest of the party. End up having too much to drink, vomiting in the toilet, and the big brother at the door of the bathroom, I get up from my vomit-induced stupor and shake his hand with the hand I just used to force myself to vomit and apologised profusely to him (for no reason, I guess I go from ballsy to apologetic when I get super super drunk). He looked extremely confused and simply said ''It's alright :)'' with a smile just like that and left (he came to pick up my ex and beat me up)Summary:
Summarize: I was 8(ish). A bunch of guys were teasing my friend and I on our way home from school the day before. They didn't even know us, they were just being mean, throwing stones etc. One of them called us bitches. When the principal asked about it the next day he asked me what they said and if they called us names. I said one called us the b-word. The principal told me to use the actual word. I'd never said that word in my life! That was the scariest part. I felt so naughty just for saying it! (I'm 22 now and still don't swear often - even typing it feels kind of weird...)Summary:
Summarize: I've asked a few questions, and have plenty more, being my first year cutting my own wood. When do you all get out there and start? I'm in Central New York state and it's 18 below zero Fahrenheit. I've done a little bit of work with the new carbide chain I bought, but holy crap as a one-man operation this would be so much easier without snow on the ground and frost in my nose. But, if now is the best time I will keep going out there.Summary:
Summarize: I've been dating this guy, Bill, for about a month. Everything's been pretty good so far, but things got weird tonight and I realized that I really, really need to break it off. -He's 10 years older than me. I like older guys, but it makes me a little uncomfortable knowing that I was learning my times tables when he was graduating high school -He got married when he was my age, then had an affair and was divorced by the time he was 28. -We live in the same apartment building. He's on the first floor and I live on the second. My bedroom is directly above his. This isn't really much of an issue on its own, because I'm in school full time and he works like, 80 hours a week so we don't see each other too much. But... -He used to date a girl who lives on the third floor. He ended things with her, but she's still really, really into him. So much that she posts Facebook statuses about him multiple times a week. -We've been sneaking around as to not upset her and cause drama throughout the house. -We're not completely sexually compatible. I mean, we share a lot of the same kinks and the sex is usually great! But his sex drive is soooo much higher than mine and I know it upsets him that I don't want to be intimate as often as he does. And it makes me uncomfortable because sometimes he gets a little pushy with it. -Tonight we were in his room cuddling and listening to music and bein' all cute and stuff, when he randomly said, "I'm broken." The music was pretty loud so I kind of pretended that I didn't hear him. I had just smoked a joint and didn't feel like talking about feelings. A few minutes later, he turned to me and said, "You know I'm broken, right?" I didn't say anything, but just hugged him a little tighter. Then I started thinking, "Fuck, I really don't want to deal with anybody else's baggage. That's not fun, I just want something casual. I'm not trying to fix some guy who's supposed to have his shit together." While I had all of these thoughts running through my head, he turned to me and grabbed my face and said, "Promise me, no matter how good it feels, no matter how in love you are, don't marry somebody before you're 30. Promise me." UM WHAT?!?!?!?! That is some crazy projection that really freaked me out. I didn't know how to respond so I mumbled "I promise" and burrowed into my sweater a little. I felt so awkward! He ended up dozing off and I just lied there thinking about how in the world I'm going to end things. That's a lot of reasons to break up with him. I'm not sure why I let it go this far, seeing as it was doomed from the beginning. I mean, yeah it was really fun at first, being all sneaky and secretive. But this is a lot more than I asked for. OH and I forgot the worst part.... I nudged him awake and told him I was going to go up to bed. I could tell he wanted me to stay over but I just couldn't. So I kissed him and went to leave and he said, really really quietly, "I love you, baby." NO YOU DON'T WE'VE ONLY BEEN DATING FOR A MONTH YOU IDIOT!!!!!!!!!!!! So I guess my question is, how do I end this? I have no idea what to say to him. I can't even drop that BS "it's not you, it's me" line because it's obviously all him. I've never really had to do anything like this before and I'm not good with any sort of confrontation. Please helpSummary:
Summarize: No it doesn't. Fandom is irrational and mostly retarded. Should I be mad at a kid born in Salt Lake City, who has never left the state of Utah, but wears a D Wade jersey? No. If you take a step back and realize how stupid it is, you start questioning your sanity. But that's sports. We care, and we don't know why. We care and it doesn't really matter, or amount to anything. I spent a while living in china for a study abroad semester, and their idea of sports "fandom" was extremely different than ours. I was talking to a guy who found out that I liked NBA, and he immediately starting listing off the players he knew... Kobe, Lebron, Dirk. He asked me 你喜欢看 kobe 吗？ "Do you like kobe?" I said no, and he was completely shocked. Like, why wouldn't I like Kobe? He's a good player, so why would I hate him? This guy couldn't even begin to understand the concept of only liking one team haha. Much less disliking a good player for no rational reason beyond the fact that he plays for a different team.Summary:
Summarize: O stary... U mnie w pracy standardowym radiem jest Trójka. Ostatnio w poniedziałek rano grzebałem coś przy radiu i jak się później okazało przez pomyłkę ustawiłem 87,8 zamiast 98,8. Leciały akurat motyw z Fraglesów, to tylko się uśmiechnąłem, że znowu jakieś żarciki ze strony trójkowej redakcji. Potem przy piosence o jabłkach i gruszkach zacząłem się zastanawiać, czy to czasem nie Dzień Dziecka. Ale jak popłynęli z motywem z jakiegoś słuchowiska, które pamiętam z jeszcze z winyli, to stało się jasne, że coś jest nie tak. Albo - że jest bardzo TAK. I wiecie co? Nie wyłączyłem jeszcze przez dłuższą chwilę. Te piosenki mają w sobie coś z /r/GuiltyPleasureMusic połączonego z dawką nostalgii od której nie sposób się oderwać. Od lat grzebię nocami w necie zapuszczając się w jakieś zapomniane korytarze alternatywy, słucham jakiegoś nienazwanego projektu z 15 wyświetleniami na YT, zapomnianego zespołu z Bandcamp, wydaję majątek na płyty i koncerty, jeżdzę na te wszystkie OFFy, Open'ery itp., ale częstotliwość 87,8 rozłożyła mnie na łopatki. Nic na to nie poradzę.Summary:
Summarize: She's given me no other option besides my family (who have no clue how bad our relationship is going) and my co-workers (who I shouldn't involve in my personal life). My wife doesn't want to talk to me about our problems...she just likes to live life as if our problems don't exist.Summary:
Summarize: My siblings very rarely want anything to do with me. It's not that they dislike me or anything (well one of the other SG kids probably does), but they're younger and have their own shit going on. If there was something important going on, one of them would get a hold of me. I haven't talked to my mother in a week, since she chose my wedding as the latest topic for her emotional abuse and manipulation. Within the past 48 hours, my sister has sent me three pictures of her son and we had a very pleasant conversation about him. Now, my mother has sent me a text message saying, "Your brother (he's 9) would like to talk to you but he's afraid you won't answer the phone because it's me calling." Am I the only one smelling some four-alarm manipulation? Or am I just being suspicious? I feel like if I respond to her, it opens the door again to abuse and another argument, and I am just now starting to heal from our last "discussion". I don't have another therapy appointment until the 4th--the first one went really well! We're going to work on setting appropriate emotional boundaries and the therapist agreed that I may need some time away from that relationship to establish healthy emotional coping mechanisms. I love my brother so much. I raised him for the first three months of his life and have always felt connected to him. I feel terrible that I might ignore the text and miss out on a chance to talk to him, but at the same time I don't know if I can take another blow to my already fragile emotional state. Not to mention all the stress-related digestive issues that are just now starting to resolve themselves. Just what the hell am I supposed to do?Summary:
Summarize: I ran into something like this, but it was a little different. When I got to high school I noticed that they only served Coca-Cola and that a fair number of people didn't like this, so naturally I started selling Pepsi out of my locker. This quickly escalated to me selling as many as three cases a week out of my locker, not only was I able to undercut the price at the vending machines (my product was not labeled for individual sale) but I was supplying something that roughly half of the school preferred. My little soda empire came to an abrupt end when I was pulled into the principals office a few months later and was made to write a four page report on something called "Pouring Rights".Summary:
Summarize: I'm in Wellington (where the qualifying game was) right now, and I have to say that it's not "batshit insane" at all. There's waaaay more interest in the fucking santa parade at 2pm than some soccer team....and there's a wine festival on, so most people are at that. The one soccer thing I saw on my way to work, was a bar with a chalkboard outfront which read "congrats to all whites", but that might just be some white supremacist shit....Summary:
Summarize: Let me start by saying we are young, I'm a 21(m), she is 19 (f). We met at a dive bar, I was in a lonely place in my life, I had been drinking too much, was failing school, and was generally in a poor way. She was really nice to me, even if I didn't think she was that attractive, and she was confident, in a lot of ways she picked me up. I'm a very shy person, so I didn't really make any moves, it took me several hours to get up the nerve to kiss her, and we went back to my place and had great sex. I told her it was only my second time having sex, and she was surprised. We kept hooking up like that (her coming over late, having sex, and then leaving) for a few weeks. Then, when she was on her period, she said she couldn't hang out with me. I said "why?" and suggested we get dinner and see a movie instead, because I really liked this girl. I think it was "Due Date" which I didn't even pay attention to because I was so nervous about being there with her. We both had come from rough families. I had been severely abused when I was 8 by my bipolar mother, she had an abusive father who had left their family. We both had trust issues, anxiety, etc. About a month after meeting her, we discussed what we were, and decided to be "official" since we were already exclusive together. Not long after, a few weeks, I told her that I loved her, and about 15 minutes later, she said she loved me too. It was the first time either of us had said that. So, our relationship started in an odd way to say the least, but I enjoyed it, and in general we were very good to each other. I took a semester off of school and basically did nothing, so I had all the time to dedicate to her. When I went back to class the next semester, I didn't have the same amount of time for her. I was basically a boring boyfriend, I smoked a lot, didn't ever go out really, made a big deal about walking her home (I walked pretty far to school every day, and I get shin splints sometimes), didn't buy her gifts except for special occasions, and was very possessive and controlling, but also very committed. A few times I joked about how I "owned her" because I paid for her dinner, and about how neither of us could do any better, and that we were good together because we "put up with each other's bullshit." All generally very immature and hurtful things to say, even if I was joking. She almost never spent the night at my place, she never opened up to me completely about her abusive past, and in a lot of ways I felt she never trusted me completely, and I never respected her completely. All in all, it was a very codependent, sex-driven relationship, even though the love was real, it was immature. We were both very complacent also. For example, when I met her, I was determined to stop smoking and go to therapy. Because I was so happy with the relationship, I dropped that idea entirely. Furthermore she had other things going on in her life, whereas I was pretty lazy and boring, and was very dependent on the relationship. We spent a lot of time together, talked every day, and acted like an old married couple. One thing I noticed was that we would fight a lot whenever I wasn't smoking weed, which was on vacation or when I went to visit her house. We were together awhile, we had our ups and downs, and then she went abroad to Israel (she has an Israeli family) and right away it started getting worse. She had always said I was the only reason she wouldn't make aliyah, which put me under a lot of pressure. She didn't Skype with me as much as I wanted to, and that made me very insecure and anxious, because I put a lot of time into staying and contact, and I felt neglected. She had said things like she'd rather be spending time with her new friends that spend time on the phone with me. When she decided to change the time she took her birth control at, I got upset because I felt that was something I should have known about, which was just a way of me venting that I felt like we didn't have enough communication, and she didn't care about me. One day, I found out she had been smoking cigarettes, which I had said was a deal breaker for me, and it also made me feel like my trust was betrayed because she could have told me and decided not to, I didn't yell at her or anything, I just told her I wanted her to not smoke. In hindsight, I should have told her the dishonesty was the problem, not the cigarettes. Before I went to visit her for spring break, I told her to make the trip about us, not Israel or her family, and she got really mad at me. She made me promise to be open to Israel, so I knew there were going to be problems ahead, because even though I'm Jewish I really don't like Israeli politics, and I don't identify with the culture at all. I didn't communicate this to her though, because I didn't realize how important it was to her. Mid-trip, I flipped out on her because I was under a lot of stress, not smoking weed, and I felt trapped because I said I wanted to go back to the hostel, and she remarked on how I didn't speak Hebrew, so how could I get home (one of my triggers for C-PTSD is being trapped and controlled, especially by women). I yelled at her, and said a lot of hurtful things, because in all honesty, I felt like I had been betrayed, neglected, and used. It was a manic episode triggered by stress and feeling trapped. Being a habitual smoker, this side of me had never come out before in such force. Looking back, we were really bad at communicating how we felt, and with such little contact, it was inevitable that we'd have problems. She broke up with me the day after I got back over skype, saying that we had different life goals (I want to travel a lot, she needs more stability), I had disrespected her (I honestly did not respect a lot of her views, or her family and friends), and she didn't want to be with someone where there was a chance I'd flip out if I didn't have weed to balance me out.Summary:
Summarize: that ass is luscious and amazing.Summary:
Summarize: I spent two weeks in China as a foreign exchange student with about 20 other United States students. The three other guys in my small group and I quickly discovered that there was no drinking age, and went to the convenience store in the lobby of the university to buy a lot of booze. It was incredibly cheap, and there were four of us, but let's just say by about 4 nights in we were drinking about 20-25 cans a night over a course of maybe 5 hours. So we would walk down the halls, knock on the other student's doors, and my buddy who we'll call Churchill would yell "Party in the 314!" (our room number). Every night, Churchill and I would fill a suitcase with cans, take the elevator to a random floor, and just fill a little trashcan that was about a foot tall with around 100 cans, and we'd just stack the extras around the trash can like a little castle. We would wake up, our room would reek of alcohol, we would take the most satisfactory of beer shits, and then rush to class down the hall. Literally every day. To be clear, we had chaperones on our trip who were upset that we weren't eating lunch in groups because they thought it wasn't safe. That's how strict they were. We would bring whole suitcases to the convenience store, and three times chaperones walked in to the convenience store while we were buying beer, and the cashier would calmly just pretend she was unpacking the suitcase rather than packing it, and then we would come back later and she'd have it packed up for us and give us a wink. We even got in to the elevator, and the most strict chaperone stepped in with us. I had a backpack full of red bull, and my Churchill had a suitcase full of loose cans that you could CLEARLY hear knocking against each other. She asked what was in the bag, and I calmly responded with red bull, and just pulled one out of my pack so she let us go. Ahhh. That was a fun trip. Especially because I'm extremely introverted and shy and so I basically just got to live as another person for two weeks. Had my first kiss there too.Summary:
Summarize: Listen here, kids: I have been playing Lee Sin since level 15(ish) because my Gold friend told me if I can master him, I could play anyone. So I decided, ah what the heck, it can't be that hard. (Spoiler: it was) But I got the hang of it and even though I still miss the occasional Q or Ulti the wrong way, I still have 50 < w/l ratio (I would tell you the exact number, but op.gg is down.) . Tonight, I saw the heavens in the form of a Pentakill. I am level 25 now and don't see any issue with playing Lee Sin at my level, as long as you researched him thoroughly before playing, and I don't mean just mobafire. I mean looking at all/most of the guides on Reddit, Youtube, and whatever other League site there is. And I think this goes for any champion that you want to play well consistently.Summary:
Summarize: I'm a twenty-four year old female and my boyfriend and I are becoming more and more serious as time goes on. We have been together for one year now. Here is the problem: his brother, who he lives with, is an absolute asshole. Before going on to describe why this is such a problem for me, I want to talk a little more about his brother, who I will call Josh. Josh regularly describes the shitty ways he treats women and the shitty ways he tries to sleep with as many women as possible. Now, while I don't necessarily think it's bad to sleep with a lot of people (if it's consensual and done respectfully on both parts), he intentionally manipulates women to get what he wants and then is really mean to them after things are over. He admitted to having left a girl in the middle of the woods when she was high on ecstasy and he was drunk (he was driving) because she annoyed him and he no longer felt like getting in her pants. Another example: this summer he knew this one girl who he had met online wanted a relationship from her online profile, yet he went out on a date with her solely for the intention of having sex with her and never sleeping with her again. He hadn't slept with anyone in four months, so he really just wanted to get laid. Now I know a lot of people do this, and I can understand his sexual frustration, but the way he did it was really shitty. He slept with her, then the next day talked to my boyfriend and I about how fat she was and how disgusting she was and what bad lay it was. These things are possible, but the way he discusses them is rude and uncalled for. It's simply indicative of his general disrespect for women. He has a technique he has called the "machine gun makeout" which is basically to keep leaning in to kiss a woman, and each time she turns away, he tries again, and keeps trying until she gives in. He combines this technique with his "drink technique" of buying girls a drink, letting them drink half, then slamming the rest himself and buying them another one. This one is based on the theory that girls drink the first half of their drink really fast and the last half slow. He is honestly this manipulative. One time Josh made a pass at me about two months after his brother and I were official and I (obviously) turned him down. I told him "I couldn't be less attracted to you given your shallow personality", yet when I told his brother about it Josh claimed I had been wanting him all along and was asking for it. Josh spends all his days off work smoking weed, drinking, and trying to use more women for sex. I don't have any problem with weed and drinking, but both of those things are pretty much all he ever does. He has no ambition. No wish to find someone he cares about and settle down. No wish to ever have kids. He just wants to go to work and then party on his days off. Lastly, Josh is terrible with money. He makes almost $100k a year but lives paycheck to paycheck, spending it all on buiyng more "toys" (e.g. dirtbike, jetboat, truck). Again, I'm not against buying nice things for yourself as long as you budget and save for the future. He once asked me (I'm in medical school), "What kind of STUFF are you going to buy once you are a doctor?" I told him that I was going to buy a house first of all, and he laughed and said, "NO. COOL stuff! Mercedes? Mustang?" He really doesn't understand that there are things to life other than money. He asked my boyfriend to go half and half on a mortgage so they could buy a house together. I did not give my opinion because I felt it was none of my business, but was secretly SO relieved when my boyfriend told him no. I think it's a terrible idea to enter into such a long-term financial commitment with someone who is hugely in debt and can't hold onto money even with a great paying job. Anyways... back to the beginning. I hate this person more than I've ever hated anyone. I haven't described the half of it because I want to keep this short enough for people to read, but I hope you can understand the situation. My question is... would this be a dealbreaker for anyone? Up until this point in the post I haven't talked about my relationship with my boyfriend, but let me just say it is INCREDIBLE. Amazing communication. Amazing sex. We are seriously perfect partners. He makes me laugh so much that I cry sometimes. But sometimes I imagine the future and I feel sick. His brother's financial habits seem to influence him somewhat. He isn't as terrible as Josh is, but he definitely doesn't save money. I am a huge saver (seeing as how I had to put myself through medical school) and I could see those mentalities conflicting. Also if we have kids one day... his brother will be their uncle. And I couldn't keep the kids away from his brother, that would be unfair to my boyfriend. So my hypothetical children would be influenced by this man (who trust me, will never change - he never wants to get married or have children, so he will always be that creepy uncle josh). I think it would be even worse if I had boys because he would want to do things with them and teach them his "techniques" with women. It makes me want to punch something imagining these children who don't even exist yet having to be around this man who I despise with a passion. So anyways. Despite this perfect relationship with my boyfriend, do you think this sort of thing (hating one of his family members so much) could ruin it? I know that typical answers on this thread are "end it, move on", but I would appreciate some input other than that because it's not realistic. It seems silly to end a great relationship because of someone who isn't even one of the members of the relationshp. It should just be about me and my boyfriend, right? At this point it's easy to ignore his brother as we're doing distance while I finish my last year of medical school. But at some point in the next year we will be hopefully living close by again and I will once more have to deal with his brother on a regular basis since they live together. And potentially deal with his brother for the rest of my life. This pains me. Any thoughts would be appreciated, especially if anyone has ever been in a similar circumstance!Summary:
Summarize: I think stationary shots can work, and even work very well, but it depends on the context. For example, if you had an action scene, a still camera won't look very good unless you know exactly what you're doing. If you're doing a Wes Anderson, two-awkward-people-sitting-next-to-each-other-awkwardly-on-a-bench scene, then a still camera can really accentuate the awkwardness. For shots with relatively small character movements, like close-ups of faces, then it would also work better, because you can keep the face in the frame. If you want to focus on something in particular, then a stationary shot will work very well. Also, they would be ideal for montages that have a rapid sequence of quick-fire shots. Because each shot is only viewable for a short time, you'll want to maximize the amount of information the viewers can learn in that short period; by keeping the camera still, you minimize visual clutter and make it easier to process things quickly. But, personally, I prefer camera movement on at least some level, to keep it visually interesting, if nothing else. *Summary:
Summarize: HAHAHAHA, guys this was the most fucking pathetic thing that has ever happened. So I've got one of these urges right, like fuck. Somehow, my monkey brain convinces me to go look at some pictures, which obviously led to a video, then I'm like "just a couple strokes bro", don't worry nothing will happen < the biggest deception ever. Then I get aroused so quickly I'm like fuck, ok stop now, now now now. I stop and then its like OH SHIT man OH SHIT I can't hold this in, I'm gonna fucking premature ejaculate after like 20 seconds man, never have ever I ever felt so demasculated, nor have I lost this quickly. As it came out, I was just watching my dick unload itself, and started laughing hysterically, like almost dying. It was just like that, streak was broken. No war, no battle, just boom, I lost so quickly. It's like I lost to my monkey brain in chess through scholar's mate. It was sadly hilarious. All in the span of like 5 minutes, from the urge to the orgasm (wouldn't call it that, more like cum-release). Anyways bros, that monkey talking will try to convince you somehow that looking at 'the latest porn', 'just to be reminded', and all that rationalization is pure bullshit and a trick by your mind. You are your own worst enemy. This hilarious mistake tonight is probably one of the best experiences I could of asked for, I will never trust my mind with any of this bullshit again, I've gotten away with it a couple times but your mind is always out to get you. The best route to take after an experience like this is laugh, as you were fooled but you will not be fooled again! Feeling bad about relapsing is absolutely useless, no need to feel bad, you fucked up. Now you know, you regret doing it but you're better off now. Regret over remorse. This is all a process of learning bros, a process of learning about how your mind is out to get you. It's not just about the streak, it's about the discipline you have after you relapse. Do not relapse multiple times, this is the worst thing and its your monkey brain trying to drag you back into the darkness. Your mind WILL rationalize that 'since you already did it once, what difference does it make if I do it 8 more times today, I'll start the streak again tomorrow, what's the difference anyways'. This is DANGEROUS, you must realize that every single time you PMO you are fading to black. We all make mistakes, but continously making those mistakes is a sure-fire way to lose all motivation and all momentum. Anyways, best of luck and keep fighting bros. This isn't just about NoFap but about discipline. You are subconsciously disciplining your monkey mind each day that passes.Summary:
Summarize: I broke down the problem on two levels. Art in any form should be judged by itself and not the person who created it. Furthermore, lets not forget that if you dont know something, doesnt mean its not happending. At least one of your "idols" have done a fucked up shit. Whether you know about it or not, does not make them a good or bad person. You could be supporting a rapist/ abuser/ molester, what have you. Your knowledge doesnt make it true or false. And since the point of interest here is music and talent, I don't think you can argue that Chris is not talented. The guy is the whole package - he can actually sing, he is a damn good dancer, he can act and his live performances are overall a pleasurable experience ( for the people that wanted to be there ). You are arguing whether or not to go to a concert, a valid reason would be your like or dislike for the singer/music style. Your opinion for the said singer as a person should be irrelavant. And lets not forget that whatever your opinion is, it is a product of a well-thought well- funded PR ( the whole, abuser/victim scenario played out by two of the hottest young celebrities is and was a fruitful situation for the media. I am certain Rihanna actually benefited a lot from it). Whatever actually happened that night is known only by parties involved. Given that you're not, I dont see how you can have such a strong opinion about it. Everything you know about it is from the media which you should know is not really a realiable source. So on the Chris Brown issue itself, I don't agree with you and I think you're being childish. If you like his music, go. If you dont, then dont go. Simple as that. I also dont agree with some of your girlfriends points. Just like you cant know what actually happened, she cant know whether ot not he is a changed man. Again, media blurs it all which is why seperating the artist and the art a good idea. Respect each other's points, agree to disagree if necessary and dont let it interfere. Im certain that (also given she had a rough upbringing) she is not a bad person supporting DV itself. Enjoying Brown's music is not equivalent to supporting his act that night. Judge her for crappy taste in music if you will, but dont make transitive dependencies where there are none. That being said, however, brings us to the actual problem. One would say partnership is about making compromises. True statement. You give and you receive. This would mean, be flexible, overlook your personal opinion and give your girl a night she would remember. But be sure this is not going to turn into a one sided benefit ( you always being the one compromising). If you know already that she is the type of person that next time, when things are reversed, she will do the same for you, you two have the required balance and you will be okay. If not, recondiser it. In my opinion, since youre two people on a vacation, its normal to have different interests and things you want to do. In that regard, there are usually two types of couples. One would handle it by making seperate plans for a few hours and enjoy something which is not mutual. Others would say, "We are in this together. You like this, Im coming with you. I like this, youre coming with me". Whatever floats your boat. My point being, make it mutual. Talk it over together and find a solution which would benefit you both and you are both okay with without holding any grudges. Find out which kind of couple you are. Leave behind the childish "Im going, stay in" and "if youre going, im not going at all" mentality. Thats not a team's ( couple's ) mentality. Ans its not gonna get you anywhere good. You are a couple, think "us" not " me and you". And be more rational than emotional. Its decision making after all. After all, you can either make it work or not. Its a good indicator for the potential of the relationship.Summary:

Yeah I'm sure he gets absolutely no slice of this whatsoever). The issue is a lot of the solutions people offer to the "Income Gap" just kind of pass the bill along. Not all, but a lot of stuff I see seems to imply that the wealthy need to pick up the bill for everyone. This is imposed through higher taxes on the wealthy (dont see how this will solve shit, now bureaucrats will just have more funds to sling around) and a gov't mandated higher minimum wage which would just cause expenses to go up and a handful of people to lose jobs while the other 80% have marginally better paying gigs. Personally, I'm pretty fiscally conservative, I think it's what makes America great, having the freedom to choose what gets done with our money as opposed to having the government (that hardly any of us trust) choose what to do with it. But I would be all for more available education to low-income families. I'm aware there's already a good amount of funding out there for those in need, and I don't think throwing money at this is necessarily the answer to the problem. But as someone who would be flipping burgers if it were not for my education I think it's an opportunity we should try to give to every american citizen. Fuck raising the minimum wage, fuck only increasing taxes on the wealthy, lets just equip our citizens to give back more to the economy and country. /rant sorry if this looks like it's directed at you /u/truwhtthugSummary:
Summarize: We've been together for 10 months. I've caught him in a few lies. When I try to confront him when I believe he's lying to me, he turns it around on me. He has lied about stupid small things, he's lied about a few bigger things. To me, lies are lies. I'm over it. The relationship stresses me out. We've talked about our future together recently. I want it so badly, but I know it can't work in the long run, we'll end up fighting again in two weeks, I know it. I feel like I've led him on in some sense. I broke up with him last week and then we got back together, he begged and pleaded for me to come back, so I did. We got along well this week, but the sadness I feel inside from his lies is unbearable. I can't do this anymore. I need to break up with him and stick to it. We're meeting in person to talk. He thinks it's going to be okay, but I need out. How do I stick with the break up when he starts to beg and plead?Summary:
Summarize: Buy a Swedish hooker. Put her through a very good education. Train her to speak perfect English and memorize a backstory of how we met, and how we fell in love. Then take her to my senior prom. Next durring senior week bring her to Loon mountain in New Hampshire ah have her teach me to ski. Then arrange for her and I to get stuck in an avalanche. I would then save her life and she would fall in love with me for real. But our love wouldn't be able to last. My Swedish hooker would be taken away from me because of a falsified visa I created to get her here in the first place. She is deported. I spend the remaning money traveling the world looking for my true love. Only to remember at the end of my journey that she is in Sweden. I travel there -funds nearly depleted- and comb the country side, searching, but to no avail. I, now nearly 80 years old, contract a deadly disease (it dosen't matter what) and I lay alone, in a foreign hospital, no money to my name; only to then see the smiling old face of my true love the Swedish hooker.

Summarize: There is, but a pure zombie deck that runs zombies only for the sake of runing zombies is not gonna get you very far. First off there's only the three zombie synchros. Of them Doomkaiser is only good with Zombie World, Revived King He Des is just bad and Archfiend Zombie Skull is easy to remove and play around. The level 8/rank 4 build is the most efficient and competitive as it toolboxes the most useful levels for both Synchro and XYZ. The reason Zombie were bonkers years ago was because Brionic and Trishula were unbanned. Now, you can make a deck centered around only Zombie type Synchro, but with only 3 synchro monsters and 3 tuners (pain painter is terrible) you're not gonna be winning games with Archfiend Zombie Skull pushes. You'll need things like Zombie World, Endless Decay and Red-Eyes Zombie Dragon if you want any success which will require you to run Pyramid Turtle over Goblin Zombie. Of course Zombie World builds are okay because they too can toolbox rank 4.Summary:
Summarize: What makes me sad is the likelyhood that the tiger will be killed for the stupidity of the kid/dad. I'm no peta-puffer but you can take a tiger out of the jungle but you can't take the jungle out of the tiger. I'd just like them to exist long enough for my kids to see.. is that to much to ask?Summary:
