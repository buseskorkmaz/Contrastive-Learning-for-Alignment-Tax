Summarize: That most people are in the relationship for personal gains and that people run from good things. First gf was fucking awesome. Up until she dropped me. Went from hanging out everyday and being madly in love to two text conversations and ultimately her pulling all the way out of my life. A few of the reasons she did this was because she had (self-diagnosed) chronic stress and when we got 'intimate' she would feel sick (is this a symptom?) Also because I didn't have a job and was unsure I would ever get one..we were fucking sophomores, you can't expect me to have my life planned out ahead of me Lauren!Summary:
Summarize: Ok, look. I'm not saying there isn't some effect of porn on the ability for some men to achieve proper arousal but I'm always very sceptical about articles like this. Hear me out. For a start, "Psychology Today" is not a medically-approved or 'official' channel of information in any sense of the word. It's owned by a publishing house and is commercially oriented. In the article itself, there are no links to primary sources or articles in real academic journals. Ok, that's the pinch of salt. Next, a lot of (if not most) ED stems from anxiety. Now the cause of this anxiety could have roots in subconscious cues picked up from viewing porn (my dick isn't big enough, my girlfriend's boobs are too small, etc.) but consider this situation: You're with your partner and things are getting hot and heavy. Your mind is engrossed in the physical act of what's taking place; the sights, the sounds, the smells and your body is getting aroused (for guys, there's often no mental stimulation required at this point, just being intimate with your partner leads to arousal). But what if it's your first time? You're worried you're not doing things correctly or you're going to go limp or s/he isn't doing things that turn you on. Oh god, now your mind's drifted and they can probably tell you're not into it. Shit now you have gone limp, FUCK! Ok sure it's not your first time, this is the significant other you've known for years, you know exactly what turns them on and vice-versa. But wait, did you remember to return that book you were meant to? Isn't there an essay due the day after tomorrow that you need to put the finishing touches on? What if you get rid of the second paragraph and just-- well you get the idea. Shit, now your cock's down for the count, better try and get hard again. Quick, get in the moment, enjoy yourself. Fuck, why isn't it working? So can you see the cycle of anxiety that turns up? Now why not throw articles like this into the mix so that every time you're about to do the business you have an additional thing to worry about? You're just tossing one more log onto your sex-fear bonfire. Sex is a complex thing, there are no rules. There are no laws saying what you can and can't think of during sex. Your brain isn't going to obey you all the time either. Intrusive thoughts about the dirty dishes or those cheques you haven't cashed yet will rear their ugly heads during the act, especially if you're already worrying about how much porn you're watching. Next, there is a difference between porn preventing people from entering and maintaining healthy relationships and porn use directly causing ED. For the former, the porn isn't the sole thing at fault. It's just another handy pillar to tie all your shortcomings on. "I can't find a girl/boyfriend because porn has messed up my standards" or "I don't find sex with my partner exciting anymore because porn." Well maybe it's actually because you won't let yourself get close to anyone, or you see prospective partners as sex objects, one-night-stands or fantasies instead of as real people (don't blame that on fucking porn, sort out your shitty standards). Maybe the sex isn't interesting anymore because you're both in a rut, sticking to the same tired routine. Again, this is on you and your partner. It's up to you to mix it up. Use some of the tricks you learned from porn, why not? If your partner hates it, stop . Simple. Finally, I do use porn, I have been in relationships, I have had anxiety issues, I have had great sex and I've given great sex. Some things to remember: Don't wank before a date It's not all about your stupid penisSummary:
Summarize: If its the one I think that it is, basically an actor and two kids were beheaded by a helicopter stunt. It was a stupid stunt, and there were a metric fuck ton of other problems with the production which have been tied back to the director.Summary:
Summarize: As someone who loves Aatrox top here's how you should play it: Deck yourself out with offensive masteries and runes preferably, however if you don't want to kill your enemy/you need to be tanky for your team, get a defensive setup. Level 1 start out with W and switch to Blood Price, keep hitting minions and stack up your blood well for a retarded 50% attack speed bonus at level 1, don't worry about the lane being pushed, it will move only slightly at the beginning. Hit level 2 and get your Dark Flight, prime your Blood Price (or if you just used it, hit a minion once at least) and hit the enemy with your stun, hold ~ and right click your opponent and cut him to pieces (~ makes you target only champions, so it ensures you don't waste your autoattacks on minions), when your Blood Price is ready, ignite and smack him with the empowered attack. Afterwards chase with flash and kill him. But, if you're against a counterpick simply don't try to trade, because if Aatrox gets countered he gets countered hard (see: Jax). In that case simply farm up, get 2 points in your W and get a vampiric scepter asap + defensive stats.Summary:
Summarize: While the intention of doing such a thing is praiseworthy, I disagree for two main reasons. First, I think that not voting is still a valid form of expression, it can mean that you boycott the election process in your district or as a whole, and that you don't want to give them the credit of your presence that a blank ballot would involve. Secondly, while I would like to share your views, I think that they are a little too optimistic, since a portion of people that vote are already doing it for bad reasons, such has: this guys is more handsome than the other one or such nonsense, imagine if people that don't normally vote were forced to do so, I don't think that many of them would be changing their view about politic. It would then cheapen the vote of people that really care about politics by burying them under the inept mass of people who vote at lawpoint. I think that we should definitively put non-coercive measure to encourage people to vote though. (cookies distribution and such) The best way to deal with the low participation rate in democratic country is and always will be education, mandatory class about politic should be add in history class, thus forcing everyone to taste a bit of it. This will allow people that could had been motivated by coercive voting measure to express their right while not affecting the people that really don't give a damn.Summary:
Summarize: You should learn to "adjust gears" - it's basically a requirement of long term training anyway. If you're going balls to the wall every time, that's your issue. I (a featherweight male) was training with a newbie yesterday who had 30 lbs on me, and he was blown away, claiming "You're so strong!". I was going ~10%, simply feeding him the responses so he and I could work on what we learned in class. With your attitude, I would've smashed the shit out of him, and he wouldn't have learned a thing. Instead, he got to work the two things he knew, and I got to work my escapes.Summary:
Summarize: The difference is that here, tannuki have human intelligence, can take human form, and on numerous occasions have been shown to have no qualms with fighting. But then when a human tries to eat them, not only do they roll over and take it, but none of the humans except for one even know they are intelligent creatures. Even if they didn't want to fight, and god knows it wouldn't even be much of a fight, any one of them at any point could have simply barged in there and said "I am a tannuki. I own a house and vote and shit. Stop eating us, you assholes" and that could have been the end of it.Summary:
Summarize: Bolts From the Blue just did a great podcast that covered this really well. Bottom line is that it would be a poor business decision for the Chargers NOT to move to LA. The Rose Bowl just opened up the ability for an NFL team to play there while a stadium is built, that would mean that they could move as of 2015 season (not possible before this year). The earliest SD could put it on the ballot is November 2016, meaning that even if it were to be approved, they wouldn't even break ground on a new SD stadium until 2017. Should it be denied, they wouldn't know until the end of 2016, and during that time LA will likely already have 1-2 teams, and the Chargers would lose a large portion of their market.Summary:
Summarize: lee sin free win. Vs yorick, max W, sustain ghouls, he pushes lane -> lasthit under turret. Get some lifesteal and W in, sustain his ghouls and hurt him with E. Throw a couple of autos when his cooldowns are up and disengage. Your cooldowns are low enough to wear him down like this. And with double W you got some nice sustain. Vlad needs to be punished early as thats where he is weakest. If he is level 9 you probably cannot kill him. Especially as melee you should not let him poke you and aim for all in fights (with champs that are stronger than him early, obviously.)Summary:
Summarize: You're wrong on a few counts: Any tea partier or libertarian that's not a complete hypocrite should (if they actually follow their beliefs) vote for prop 19. Considering Prop 19 is polling 10 points above the opposition, it's a bit presumptuous to assume staying neutral buys more 'swing voters' than an endorsement. And on a theoretical level, swing voters don't win elections, energizing your base into action win elections. 'Swing voters' aren't going out and handing out flyers, attending town hall meetings, or organizing voting registration parties: the base is.Summary:
Summarize: I skipped that entire post because I'm a CS major and already knew that. Without the benchmarking data in front of me, I can't say for certain whether or not there is a speed difference. I was running solely on my experience with my own upgrade. The noticeable difference between Win 7 64 bit and Win 8 64 bit wasn't actually that great. Overall it feels just a hair faster. My point was that the change from 32 to 64 in conjunction with the new OS (ignoring the fact that it's a clean install) probably had more to do with the speed difference than the OS alone. So yes, you are correct. But I don't think that a switch from 32 to 64 had a negative effect on overall speed. Without benchmarking data, I can't say for certain one way or another. All I can say is that the noticeable speed between the two OSs aren't that great.Summary:
Summarize: Of course it is platform dependent. It is entirely dependent upon your softwares implementation of HTTP. That the HTTP spec uses URI's and the URI spec itself lays out the many interpretations of URI's leads to the reality that any implementation may normalize or not normalize depending on its needs. This variation, this inconsistency, it's literally in the spec. As a user you should not expect normalization.Summary:
Summarize: Bear with me here. Women seem to like it when I talk dirty to them (because I've learned to do it right; always be real, don't ever be cheesy, yada yada). One or two haven't responded but most do and some go absolutely crazy for it. Well today a thought occurred to me that sounded absurd at first, but after considering it, I'm wondering if it might have a positive effect. Let me explain by backing into this: See I dated a girl a couple of years ago who knew the secret to outstanding sex with a man (other than being relaxed, passionate & open-minded). She acted as if she worshiped my cock. She just couldn't get enough of it. Ladies, if you don't already know, this is the secret to being the best a man has ever had. Anyway, a couple of times she came over, unzipped my pants and started saying, "There's my boy! I missed you! How have you been!?" and would continue, even with her mouth full (another huge turn-on). Now the talking to it was obviously just her being funny and we both got a kick out of it, but I think it actually added a level of turn-on for me. So I'm wondering, if done right, could it also be a turn-on for a guy to talk to a girl's pussy the same way?Summary:
Summarize: wall of text First timer here. :) I live with my family, so naturally, I am the go-to for IT stuff. Now, my mum and my brother are computer literate. They have their own desktops/laptops at home. Dad on the other hand, was the more stubborn kind. I have a fileserver at home, which has Win 7 and multiple log-in patch. I don't know about running virtual desktops so thats why i went this route. Everyone at home as an account, so they can remote into it so they can access their bigger files on the go, or when they are at someone elses house and want access via someone else's PC. This fileserver is attached to the TV in the lounge, so that people logged into the MEDIA account can watch movies and such.The MEDIA account is heavily restricted. Only shortcuts to exist on the desktop to the movie/tv ep folder, and Chrome can only access certain websites (i have one of those pc's with firewall/web monitoring, cannot remember the name as I installed it yonks ago now. smoothwall or something?) Backstory about dad. Dad has had his own desktop/laptop in the past. He actually has a new ASUS laptop when he went on his oveseas trip couple of months ago. The problem is, he is one of those people who cannot contain himself when it involes Pron, and every single ad is a temptation to click. So does his emails. Newly formatted/installed windows will start freezing in a couple of weeks, and there are a bajillion of toolbars. I have actually restricted his own account on his laptop due to this. Cue Sunday night. He doesn't have work for this day (he is roster-based). So he goes to watch as per usual. He decided to browse facebook and the normal sites available. He then suddenly forgets that he is restricted, and starts raging on why he cannot do this/do that. First stop, my door. dad: Oi! Why can't I download this file off my email? me: because you can't. I've restricted your account. dad: what the fuck. I should be able to. Its my account after all! me: no, its the MEDIA account. Its restricted. I don't want viruses or malware on it. dad: no, it is my account. I use it all the time. I should be allowed to do whatever I please. me: you know, I will just unrestrict your laptop. BUT do not come back to me for help with fixing it. dad: whatever. just go do it. So I do. Gave him user access (without admin rights, just to keep it in check). He's happy, for a few days. dad: How do I edit the registry? I was reading something online, and that I could download stuff free if I edit the registry. me: You can't. If you do that without know what you are doing, you could risk doing something bad dad: what's so bad about free downloads. You do it on your fileserver. me: at least i know how to get them without getting a virus or some malware crap. dad: just do it, will ya. So i decided to not give a damn anymore after that amount of whinging from him. Mum heard this, and had a big smirk on her face, as she knows where this will lead to. I remove all restrictions, and told him that he can do it himself and show him how to run regedit. NOT 5 MINUTES! dad: errrr something is wrong. I'm now getting popups and this is saying that I have a virus and i need to download it. me: registry shouldn't do that. what did you do? dad: well since you took off the restriction, I decided to download that file off my email which you so hated. It had an awesome powerpoint jokes from my friend. But then it started doing this. me: did it tell you to install something? (just wanting to confirm) dad: that was the only way to get the powerpoint thingee out and onto my desktop. /facepalm me: go away. I told you I won't fix it if something went wrong. dad: why do you have to be so selfish. Just fix it. Then this happened mum: because you idiotic fuck was told what would happen if you did this kind of crap. You were restricted for a reason from the last time your son had to put a new operating system in it. my bro and I poke our heads out our door and see dad, head down, walk away and sit down, defeated. He goes to watch a tv ep afterwards. My mum had this smirk again, and told me to fix it, and this time, not to remove the restrictions and tell him to speak to her regarding it.Summary:
Summarize: So this fuck up actually happened a couple years ago, but just came to my mind and I thought I should share. A couple years ago I had just started my sophomore year of college and had finally moved out of the dorms and into a quaint townhouse with my close friend. I was so excited to finally have my own space, and with that space I found it was much easier to smoke the occasional bowl without fear of being reprimanded. Enter me with a nice new bag of ganja. I'm relaxing in my room on the second story of the apartment which happens to have a small balcony I can step out onto. I've managed to roll a pretty impressive joint, so I ask my roommate if he'd like to come smoke this work of art with me. He obliges and we step onto my balcony, making sure to shut the sliding door nice and tight so as to not let excess smoke into the apartment. We carry on talking for a while and decide to go back inside to play some Mario Kart. I turn to open the balcony door and after trying a few times to open it, it dawns on me that we have somehow locked ourselves out of the apartment (I still to this day don't understand how the door locked, as it is one of those latches that flips upwards and slots into a hole to lock. I can only assume I shut the door so hard that the latch flipped itself 180 degrees into its locking position). I immediately decide I will call my father who lives only 30 minutes away and see if he can come open our door for us since he has a spare key. He answers and says he will be right over. Phew, crisis averted. Suddenly I notice out of the corner of my eye the bag of weed sitting on my desk, with rolling papers right next to it. Now I'm freaking out. I can't have my dad see this when he comes into my room to open the balcony door for us. Instantly I call him back and tell him to abort mission as we have managed to jimmy the lock and are back inside. Phew, crisis averted. Shit, now what do we do. It's slowly getting chillier as the sun starts to set and we have not come equipped to deal with anything under 70 degrees. I throw an idea out to my roommate: lets call a locksmith and have him come unlock our door for us and let us in. My roommate then points out the fact that the locksmith will also undoubtedly see the weed on my desk and might not be 420 friendly. Shit. Ok, I'm not very athletic, but maybe I can lower myself off the balcony to the ground and after the locksmith opens the door I'll just come let my roommate in. In our impaired state we determine this to be the best course of action. I start to lower myself off and immediately freak out because the drop is way farther than I had anticipated. I climb back up and tell my roommate there's no fucking way and resign to kick the glass door of the balcony in and just pay the repair costs. He stops me and says he will do it, but agrees that it is definitely too far to fall without hurting himself. We have all but lost hope when a neighbor walks by coming home from work. She's a small girl, maybe 4'5'' at most. I don't pay her much attention, but my roommate sees something in her that I have not. He calls out to her and asks her if she has a ladder. She say's that she might and will be right back. She comes back out of her apartment with a nice fancy BIC lighter and asks "will this work?" Even though I'm quite distressed and starting to freeze my ass off I can see the humor in this miscommunication. My roommate does not and yells back "A LADDER, NOT A LIGHTER". Turns out she doesn't have a ladder. We explain the events that brought us to this point (minus the weed) and ask if she has a boyfriend or some guy living with her that could spot my friend as he drops off the balcony. She does not unfortunately, but she'd be happy to spot him, she was a cheer leader in high school! With the knowledge of this tiny girls cheer leading skills we proceed to lower my roommate off of the balcony. He is now about three feet under the balcony holding onto my arms and his feet are directly above the girl on the ground as he looks me dead in the eyes with fear I have never seen in my life and have yet to see matched and tells me to let him go. He drops rather gracefully and lands on the ground with no incident. The girl looks very confused about what just took place and says something involving 'pretty', 'short' and 'fall'. Her words go in one ear and out the other because all I can hear is the sound of my heart pumping faster than I knew was humanly possible. My friend looks absolutely ecstatic, like he just successfully parachuted out of a plane and stuck a 10/10 landing. I call the locksmith, he arrives, breaks my front door lock trying to get it open, spends about 30 minutes trying to open the broken lock, somehow succeeds by hammering the shit out of the lock and my friend rescues my frozen ass after 2 hours of sitting on the balcony. I pay the locksmith $70 for breaking my lock. The next day I pay the landlord $80 to replace the lock. That night I catch the tiny girl heading to her apartment after work and give her a $50 VISA gift card.Summary:
Summarize: Hi /r/buildapc, first of all a thank you is in order as it's because of you that I managed to piece together my system (first and only build) which included an i7 3570, Asus P8Z77-V LX, etc that I am over the moon about. However, at the time of the build I didn't have quite enough to splash out on a graphics card and so decided to hold off until I would be able to get a decent one. Now that I've saved up enough I'm ready to buy a new graphics card and two monitors. I have around a £500 budget to do this and it's certainly worth noting that I'm not looking two identical monitors. My intentions are to have one 24" monitor that will be used for gaming and day-to-day use and a lower-end 19-22" monitor that will be occasionally used for general work when needed. For that reason, if I could find something for around £100 (+15 if from Argos) then this would be an adequate enough buy for the 2nd monitor which would then leave £400 to be spent on a GFX card and main monitor. As I'm still relatively uneducated when it comes to connections (DVI and the like) this is why I need your help before I start buying things. Searching on Amazon (and having previously owned a radeon card) I have found that the 7870 fits my budget quite nicely and yet I'm not sure if the Sapphire one supports dual monitors as I look at the XFX version and it clearly has two DVI connections (and that makes me assume the XFX can do dual while the Sapphire can't). So yeah, would anyone be able to clear up the connectivity of these cards for me? [Sapphire 7870:]( [XFX 7870:]( If either of those do the job then I would be happy to go ahead and get it leaving the monitors to be figured out. I have about £15 worth of Argos vouchers at the moment that will be running out around Christmas I thought it would be a good idea to get the 2nd monitor from there but again I'm not sure about connectivity. I've found this one which fits my budget but would it do the job?: [Argos Samsung Monitor:]( For the main monitor I have no idea where to even start so I'm quite open to suggestions as long as the company can ship to the UK. If everything else has stuck to the budget then I should have about £200 to spend on this part. So yeah, sorry about the messy train of thought but to sum it up:Summary:
Summarize: It's not absurd. It's a matter of principle. Do you think when Empire Strikes Back came out, it'd be okay to run down the streets yelling "VADER IS LUKE'S FATHER!! HAHA!"? The answer is no. As viewers that have the luxury of keeping up to date with shows/movies, we should respect other people that don't have this luxury. You can be excited all you want, but in the Prof's case, instead of posting this shit to the entire class, why not go ask, "Oh hey, have you seen last week's episode of BB? Yeah? Cool! Let's discuss our excitement!" - IMO, this is what the teacher should be doing, instead of literally, ruining the show for, potentially, many people. The feelings that we had when watching that episode were immense; they were great; they were what us humans love to feel in our lives. Do you really want to prevent another person from feeling these awesome things by spoiling shit for them? Your mentality is no better than the trolls that lurk through Reddit and post random spoilers in the most random of thread. So, to avoid you saying "but again, what's the timeframe?",Summary:

Summarize: And I wanted to talk about it! Background: I live in Canada, I'm 22M, and this is (jackass!) a throwaway. I'm not particuarly gay and I read that anal has been more and more common among heterosexuals lately so I don't feel weird or anything about it and I always wanted to try it. I've always had a very low level of prudishness(?) and am willing to try pretty much anything at least once and wanted to share my experience with everyone, particularly other males who are considering anal but don't know what to expect. Not that I am an expert or anything, this was only my first time too. There was no partner involved, just some toys I ordered online. It took until now for me to realize that I'm an adult with my own apartment and credit card, and I can finally buy some toys to try out. My haul included: A 9" Blue Jelly Rubber Dildo ( which I found out after the fact was not the best choice, see here for details but my gag reflex was too strong, so that idea was out since I wasn't going to try it again after I'd used it anywhere but my mouth no matter how much I cleaned it. Up to that point I'd already loosened myself up gradually with other toys so that when I finally inserted this one, there was next to no discomfort in the penetration. I was surprised to find I could take all 9 inches up to the hilt on my very first time (is that normal?), and having all of it inside me was very satisfying. The only downside to this toy, besides learning later about the rubber thing, was that it had a very poor suction cup on its base, making mounting it on the wall or anything dificult, and no form of adhesive like tape will stick to it for very long. In the end I constructed a sort of holster out of tape folded in on itsself that the rubbery balls portion docks with and remains locked tightly. I hope I can find a pthalate-free alternative/replacement. If anyone has any suggestions, please share! A Generic Wireless Remote Vibrator . It has one speed and seven options for the rhythm. Pink and waterproof! It's starting speed was a bit strong at first, but became very enjoyable after I grew acclimated to it. A second hard plastic vibrator , this one long and thin. It has a dial for speed at the base and goes faster then anything else I bought. Stimulating! A Small (possibly jelly, I should double check that) Vibrating Buttplug . It wasn't very satisfying since at its widest it was still smaller then pretty much all the other toys I got, but still nice for getting used to having things inside me. **[An Aneros Helix]( This didn't really work all that well for me because I don't have very strong muscles down there. I was not able to clench or unclench very hard, long, or often enough to achieve any significant sensation, but I won't rule this out until I've had more practice with it. An intimidating clinical-looking metal thing called the Pure Wand (formerly Jupiter Wand.) I haven't actually tried this one yet but I've read nothing but positive reviews about it. If anyone here has one, please share your experiences with it. Hard Plastic Anal Beads . They're a weird wavy shape but I am eager to try them out soon. That concludes the penetrative purchases, other things I bought were a rubbery red cock ring (It's kind of tight but I think that's the point. I didn't particularly enjoy the feeling of all the blood trapped down there or seeing parts of me turn red, coupled with reading about the risks , and a pair of nipple suckers (black PVC cylinders with a sphere the size of a Mirabelle plum you compress to create suction. Hair gets in the way so its good to be clean shaved anywhere you plan on using them, but otherwise they offer a very strong suction feeling and rarely fall free.) Last but not least, bottles of a silicone-based lubricant , a water-based lubricant , and a toy cleaning disinfectant type deal ([which I am now having second thoughts about after reading this comment]( I found the silicone-based was not as lubricating as the water-based, but lasted much longer. Water-based was very slippery but required more and more often applicated to yield desireable results. As always, take care to avoid using silicone based lubricant in conjunction with silicone based toys. Kind of a lot for first time buying, right? In the end it came out to be about 200$, since a lot of it was on sale. The metal Pure Wand dealie is usually around 100$ on its own so I'm pretty happy with what I got. The only product I didn't get in this initial spree I was interested in was an inflatable buttplug. If anyone has any experience with these, please feel free to share! Enough stories from me though, I do have questions too, beyond the ones asking about the specifics of various toys I mentioned before! Most of all my biggest concerns are about keeping myself and my new toys clean, avoiding any common problems, infections, or injuries I as a newcomer may face (are there even common injuries?) and most of all, I'd like to hear about others experiences with toys and their recommendations of products I might consider in the future.Summary:
Summarize: I had an honest conversation with my serial cheater father (cheated on my mum with at least 5 women, probably much more) for the first time. He left her twice, though he's back with her now. I'm not sure where to take the relationship from here. Should I bother trying to have a relationship with him, considering that I only want to have a relationship with people who are respectful of me and care about me? To give more information, he was one of those dads who is always working and is rarely there, so we have never been close. The questions i asked him: “Would you have changed anything if you had known that I knew you were cheating on Mum when I was a teenager?” “I don't know that I would have.” “Did you think it would affect me?” “I didn't see how it would.” “What were you thinking, how did you think it woudl affect me?” “I didn't think about it.” “Did you think about how it would affect Mum?” “She didn't value me, so I saw it as being with someone who did value me.” (She often says things like “men are useless” and laughs at the music and TV shows he likes.) “How did you think I'd react when you left?” “I thought you'd be upset. But I didn't think too much about my feelings, I just thought I'd say it's my fault, my decision.” I don't know what to think about this. First of all...don't those answers seem...weird? How do you not think about this stuff? I feel somewhat upset about these answers, though he did apologize for having upset me what with all the cheating. I feel like he doesn't...I don't know, care? Does it seem like I'm being overly sensitive? I'm coming to reddit because, does this seem like the kind of father I should attempt to have a relationship with, or should I continue having an extremely distant and occasional contact with him?Summary:
Summarize: Last time on Star Trek The Next Generation...]( ..And now, the conclusion. I knew it. I goddamn well fucking knew this was inevitable. When you live in a city with barely 150,000 people in it, and in the poor end of town, you see a lot of familiar faces and sometimes pretty often. But this was one piggy face I honestly had hoped I'd never see again. Yeah, right...let's set the scene. Grab them jimmies and [hold on to yer butts!]( It's a halfway decent Sunday afternoon last week. The weather's not too humid and muggy for a goddamn change, and the sun isn't hovering over head, giving every living thing melanoma after only a few minutes exposure and the grocer I'm at where the sales are going on is packed to the tits. Once more I find myself in the express lane looking like a tit. My hair's cut, face shaven, glasses on and looking pimp in my dress shirt, pants and shoes. Why am I dressed like this? I had a job interview at the chain pharmacy for a stock/till position a few blocks over. In my plastic, fantastic basket is a package of skinless, boneless chicken breasts, two cans of tuna, mustard and a box of store-brand shake and bake. The express lane is a long one, but moving far quicker than the other three checkout lanes. Why grocery stores have 10-12 registers but only open 3 at any given time, regardless of how busy they are, I will never know. There's a few folks in front of me, I've got my phone out and I'm browsing email when a clammy cloven hoof pokes me in the shoulder. I turn around and [I find myself staring into the puffy, piggy face of a previous nemesis. This is the fattest sensation of deja vu I've ever had.]( Moreover, I'm amazed she hasn't recognized me! "Yes?" >Can I cut in front of you? "Why?" >My knees are sore from rehab an' arthitis. I sneak a quick glance at her cart. While not full...she's very clearly got at least twice the maximum item count for the express lane. Now had this been a weekday, I might have entertained the idea of letting her ooze on ahead of me and waited. But since it's sunday and the buses are on a reduced schedule, I opted to stand my ground because fuck waiting 50 minutes for the next bus when mine was due in 15, and hammy would no doubt take longer than that. "I'm sorry, no. I've only got a few things and I'm paying cash." >Well my knees are sore and stiff!(No fucking doubt, lardo..) You should show some respect. I shake my head and turn around. Barely 4 minutes pass and I'm putting my small gathering of goods on the belt, barely taking up any space on the belt when I notice a long line of garbage being unloaded near my own. Attempting to take a diplomatic route, I put down the belt divider trapezoid. This triggers the beast. With no word of warning, she grabs the divider and tosses it aside where it clatters to the floor, and more processed, salt laden garbage fills the belt. I refuse to acknowledge the bitch and inform the cashier of which items are mine. As the poor girl behind the register is punching keys and doing her thang...it happened. The hambeast SHOVES her cart into me and attempts to push me aside. Scowl, or at least what I imagine was one, etched across her piggy features. By this point I've had my complete, and absolute fill. I yank the cart away from her toward the front of the belt and upend it onto its side..spilling doritos in a resounding crash of steel wire and plastic wheels. The store is now silent and the manager is on her way over. The cashier is aghast. I'm staring at the ham, staring death at her. Beyond furious at this womans entitlement. I didn't even have time to pay for my shit before she started to LITERALLY get pushy with me. In the end, I find myself talking to the manager who confers with the cashier and the cashier the next register over. He rightly gives me a stern talking to, and I give him an apology. The hambeast is asked to shop somewhere else today, as they will not serve her because she provoked the incident. In the end, I hung around to help clean up the mess made when I turned over the cart, as I felt pretty shitty for being such a massive ass. I just wanted some fucking chicken at a good price. :\Summary:
Summarize: Suppose a bit of back story would help. I was recently promoted to a position of supervision within my current company, coming off the floor I know the woes of the people I am now in charge of watching over. It is a warehouse environment, pulling auto motive parts that range from little fuses and bulbs to heavier items such as full pallets of oil, brake drums, crank shafts, etc. so it is understandable that the turn-over rate would be high as the wear and tear gets to people over time. New employees don't accrue vacation / personal time until being with the company for a full year, benefits after probation period of 90 days or so, however we try to do our best to help folks out with day off requests if the workload is not to bad for that particular day. We tell new hires up front what to expect so there are no surprises (busy season resulting in longer hours / overtime many days) and 90% of the time they agree and say no problem, onward with the hiring process. Now for the ranting. Though many of our new hires have already begun to take advantage of the call off policies, will give an example of one of the more recent hires. Hired a guy a few months back now as a temp / part-time worker, hard working kid with a good attitude, coming to work daily, and not having to micro manage everything he does. Spot becomes available for a permanent position, offer it to him, gladly accepts. No problem. Fast forward a month down the road, begins to have some family issues happening at home, we allow a day here and there for him to take care of business so he can come back focused. Starts to take advantage of the attendance policy, calling in sick on Monday's / Friday's, usually some excuse along the lines of 'I have a headache' or 'I slept on my neck funny'. Anyhow finally reaches the point of having to sit him down and let him know this is not acceptable behavior, and if he continues down this road it could lead to more corrective action all the way to termination. Immediately gets aggressive saying we are asking to much of them, and that the place is a sweatshop, etc. etc. which we discuss for about 10 more minutes before finally letting him decide whether we will be able to rely on him to continue coming to work daily or if he should pursue other interests. He of course says he would like to remain with us. Get home for the day after running errands and check my email, log into Facebook, and lo and behold, the said kid we just sat down with for a discussion is having an all out rant on Facebook about how we are the equivalent to a plantation and the workers our slaves, and how we are unreasonable since we will not move our start / end times around his schedule so he can go back to school. Maybe it's just me and he has valid points, on the other hand I can't help but think he was in a temp / part-time position that would have probably fit his schedule a bit easier, and was under no obligation to come to full time. Personally I can count on one hand the amount of sick time I have had to use in my last 6 years here.Summary:
Summarize: To resolve these issues I'd suggest 'Ask once, then deal with it appropriately'. Take clothes that are lying around and pile them in front of their door. If they don't move them for a week, throw them outside. Same as above, throw in front of their door or throw outside. Let milk sit out for a week. Then label it as yours. See if they enjoy it. Same with other food that is difficult to tell if it is bad or not. Ask for compensation. Ask them to wash the towel. If they don't, take one of theirs. Tell them that was a wise investment. Was it your pre-amp? Tell them negligence doesn't excuse destruction, and not paying attention to the road and hitting another car doesn't excuse a ticket and consequences. They're not 6, 'I didn't know' is not a viable excuse anymore. If they don't know, ask. There are noise laws, and if it exceeds the decibel range for the time of day or exceeds a time of 15 minutes (at least in my town) where it is disrupting your life you can get quite a few fines racked up against them. Ideally, pick your roommates better. I've never had a problem that lasted, and I've lived on my own for the past 9 years (29 now) in dorms, houses and apartments. Speak with authority, be up front, don't be an ass but be firm with how things need to work. Remind them if they're not going to play nice you have no reason to either.Summary:
Summarize: Balancing League of Legends with an algorithm Balance is a popular topic talked about in just about any type of game. From chess to League of Legends, balance is key element which game developers strive to achieve. But what is balance? The first definition of the noun I met on the internet is: 'a situation in which different elements are equal or in the correct proportions' . In league terms, the situation would be the game and the elements would be the champions. Indicators of game balance : What data would we be looking at league terms to quantify the balance of the game? Win Rate (W): This would be the first thing which would come to mind of most players. Win Rate is the ratio of (games with said champion in the winning team) / (games played where the champion is played), so it seems a logical conclusion that if X champion has a win rate of 60%, that champion is overpowered (OP) and would need to be made weaker for the sake of balance. Whilst this is probably true, it is not the whole story. Play rate (P): A ratio of the games where a champion is picked / the the total number of games played. This could almost be seen as the popularity of the champion but of course a popular champion may not be played often because said champion is always banned. Ban rate (B): A ratio of how many times said champion is banned/the total number of games played. Ban rate seems like a good indicator of how OP the player base seem to think the champion is as a collective and so it would be worth considering in terms of balance. There are many more variables which could be used to measure the balance of a particular champion but these would seem to be the main ones. You don't have to think about it for very long to realise just how complex of an issue this is. For the sake of reddit, I will only focus on Win rate as an example. The current system : From what I gather, the game is mainly balanced by a group of game developers which look at all of the factors mentioned above (and more), player feedback, as well as their own experiences as I would think most of them would be avid players of the game, and collectively decided on the details of the next patch, tweaking the game using a range of methods which can be grouped into three categories: Buffs (+) are changes which increase the strength of a champion. Most would agree that increasing the base health of a champion by 200 hp is quite a significant power increase, unless of course this negatively affects a mechanic specific to the champion. Nerfs (-) are the inverse of the above, decreasing the power of a champion. Tweeks are changes which are not immediately obvious how they would affect a champion's strength but which would end up being acknowledged as a nerf or a buff as time progresses and the meta shifts. A key point to note is that the goals of Riot may not necessarily be to completely balance the game. After all, there is no evidence that a game where all the champions have 50% win rate would be more fun than it currently is. The things which influence how they balance the game might include the competitive scene (buffing fun to watch champions, nerfing 'boring' ones), skins sales (they need to make money so it makes financial sense for them to buff/not nerf a champion with a new ultimate skin) amongst others... My proposed system: The aim is to get every champion to have a win rate of around 50% (+/- 1%). Algorithm crunches data from a sample (or all) of the ranked 5v5 Solo Queue games within a time interval (ie a day or a week) Algorithm looks at how far away every champions Win Rate is from 50%, possibly looking at other factors which can be hand tuned by developers. Each champion's specified base stat(s) will be increased/decreased, depending on if their win rate is less than or greater than 50% The process is repeated over the next time interval A very simple and 'process' as pythonic pseudo code could look something like this: def balance(champion_space): for champ in champion_space: champ.health += (0.5-champ.win_rate)*champ.health_const As you can see, this is a very simple self regulating procedure (similar to homeostasis in the body or how a thermostat works) could possibly produce volatile and often counterproductive results over a short period but in the long term, the win rates of the champions would stabilise into in equilibrium. As stated above, this would NOT be an ideal implementation but it gives an idea of how what I am suggesting. The 'win rates' would be restricted to similar champions (ie top laners, junglers, bruisers) and various other champion and stat specific coefficients can be adjusted and improved at any given time. The advantages of such a system would be that it would be that such an algorithm would still allow full control of the developer, they can release and implement whatever changes they need, but over time, the game would 'balance out'. They can focus on emphasising champions' strengths and weaknesses, allowing every champion to feel different, creating unique mechanics, and mostly trying to make the game fun without worrying about what that will do to the win rate of a champion.Summary:
Summarize: Okay, so... My boyfriend and I have been together on and off for three years. I'll give you the full run down of everything that's happened, but before I do that, I'll say that at least 80% of people will tell me I should just end it and I've absolutely tried several times and it just doesn't work. Why is that? Maybe you all can tell me and we can solve this whole thing right here right now because I'm going insane... Three years ago, I started dating a friend of mine with a lot of issues. I had just come out of high school and was working full time hanging out with people whenever I was free. This friends issues consisted of having several drug problems, issues with family, on the verge of being kicked out of his house he lived in with his older brother, he was on felony probation for grand theft auto (sounds bad but was a complicated situation.. Basically he was 17 and it was a misunderstanding with a friends parents and would up taking the vehicle across state lines and it was a whole big mess but still it was stupid), had no job, no high school diploma and amongst all that he was just in a terrible place in life and in his mind. When I found him, I, as always, thought for sure I would be able to save him and pull him up and out from this dark place. And I did just that. When I met him, he was going through all this and his life was on the verge of failure, but I put all that I had into him and into our relationship and he did a total 180 which I will explain later. A few months after I decided to do this thing, he did wind up getting kicked out of his house and I took him into mine and my fathers house. He stayed there a while and all was okay but soon enough he received a warrant for his arrest for failure to report (since he wasn't calling in to talk to his PO, what a moron). So basically, this guy is saying "oh yeah well I'm just gonna leave I'm not gonna go to jail la la la happy day" and I'm like no you've got to get this handled. So I drive him to the jail and he turns himself in. He gets sentenced to nine months. Seven with time served. Guess what I did? I stayed. The whole time. It was really tough and scary for the both of us. I drove 45 mins twice a week every week for the first four months he was in to go visit him, I put money on my phone to talk to him, I wrote letters, I did t all. He was always sweet and had things to say and always told me how much he loved me, but at the end of the fourth month, he started to become very quiet and distant. He became angry and bitter. Like he was becoming someone else for no reason at all. I mean, I understand that isolation and being in jail is hard on a person, but I was there for him giving all I had and I chose to spend my time on him because I loved him, or I thought I did and I felt like I deserved love and respect 100% of the time. Anyhow, once he became distant, I started visiting less, calling less, writing less and it began to turn into almost nothing at all. I had began to regain contact with an ex boyfriend of mine in this vulnerable time, and you can guess what happened next. I cheated on my boyfriend with him. I messed up and I never told him. He got out of jail a few months later and things just weren't the same. We were together all of four days once he got out and then he calls me and goes "hey can you give me a ride somewhere?" And I go yeah sure. So, having no clue were I'm taking him, he leads me out to this apartment complex insisting "it's a surprise"... We get there and out walks his ex girlfriend of two years and they share a long embrace more powerful than any he and I had shared over the course of that year we were together. I drive them back over to his house and they're thinking "we're all going to hang out and have a few drinks"... No. I wasn't doing that. I dropped them off and I wished them both the best of luck going forward as I knew they had feelings for one another with the way they had embraced moments before (messed up situation I know). Now we go separate ways for about 8 months. I start drinking pretty heavily and making some crappy choices. I moved across the country back to my hometown for about two months then realize that it wasn't where I wanted to be. I came back, got a couple jobs and tried to keep myself busy as best as I could. Out of the blue, I get a phone call. It's him. He asks "hey my mom said you were working up at the auction" (as I still kept in contact with his family) "I was wondering if you might be able to get me a job with you". Being the person I am, of course, I get him the job. He starts working with me and I learn that his relationship with this other girl wasn't what he thought it would be. They dated for 7 months and she took him for everything he had, they did nothing but do drugs and be failures until the bitter sweet end. Bottom line, he tells me all about what I've missed and I tell him all about what he's missed and in the crossfire, our relationship now is different. He is working, not on drugs, not on probation and we're friends. Good friends. Over the time he worked with me at the auction, we had a great time. Everything was going really well. Then, out of the blue, something happened. We fell in love again. But it was different this time. There was respect. There was honesty. There was hope. We had gone three months working together without a confession of real feelings and when it all finally came out, it was unlike anything I've ever been through. It was strange. It was real. Once we got back together, we were a dream team. We never argued, his family loved me, we had so much to talk about, we loved each other whole heartedly. About 6 months after we started seeing each other again, he asked me to exclusively be his girlfriend. I couldn't bring myself to say yes because I still had not fessed up about the cheating while he was away nor had I told him about the thing I did while we were separated. I had oral sex with his older brother who lived, and still lives, in the same house with him. (I know, I'm a terrible person. It was done only out of anger and spite, nothing more. It was a bad thing. I know.) So, basically I dodged the question and kept dodging until I couldn't wait anymore to confess my indecencies. It was a Saturday. 2AM and we had been drinking to excess. I decided at that moment that it was a good time to come clean. So I did. He, being intoxicated and given that kind of news, threw his drink on me and called me every name in the book... Then he hit me. Open hand. Three times in my face. My teeth were broken and my face was bruised. In my mind, I got what I deserved and had the tables been turned, with the involvement of alcohol, I would've done the same thing. Had he been sober, that event would not ever have transpired. After that, things were never the same. It started a chain reaction of break ups and make ups, mess ups and fix ups, just ups and downs at every turn. He never hit me again after that night, but the arguments grew frequent, the happiness began to fade, the resentment took hold of the both of us. After talking and talking and talking it out, we decided that if we wanted this to work, we were going to have to leave the past in the past and never come back to it ever again. We were going to have to start over. And we did. We came together and conquered what trials we faced. He cleaned up a lot. Got his GED, a car, two jobs, made things right with his family, with himself, with me. Everything was great, save the normal stupid arguments that every couple has. Things persisted on being great for about three months or so and then something happens. One of his two jobs was a pizza delivery driver that one of my long time friends helped him get. He seemed to be doing well and all was good, but one day, I get a phone call from my friend who worked with him... She goes "Grace, I feel so terrible but I was sworn to secrecy. He has been all over this girl at work, he flirts with her and says she has a nice ass and he went to a party she was at and I don't know what happened all I know is that he was being dishonest with you and I'm sorry I kept it from you". When I heard this (I am already an extremely self conscious individual and having intimate feelings for another girl is one thing I wasn't prepared to tolerate) I immediately broke up with him. At that point I had tunnel vision and wanted no discussion at all on the matter. Long story short, we ended things for about a week, then decided that we were taking everything just too seriously and needed to still be together but take a step back and be the best we can be moving forward while realizing that no relationship is perfect... And now here we are... He's great sometimes, other times not so much. Sometimes I have terrible dreams about him doing awful things to me or to someone else. I feel as though he may be a compulsive liar and maybe he could even have some severe mental and emotional discrepancies. What I do think I might know for sure is that I love him... But I don't really know what I feel anymore... About him or about anything. I'm just so drained and I'm in Cosmetology school full time and work as well, I go to the gym five days a week and I'm battling a plethora of my own emotional problems. I really really want it to work with this guy but I don't know why. I don't know if I'm blinded by love or stupidity. I don't know what's right or wrong anymore and all I want to do is be happy... I just don't know if that's possible anymore... What do I do, guys? Give me your best even if it sounds like I'm a lost cause...Summary:
Summarize: Someone did this to me. But in a fucking /soc/ thread. On the first day I got a new phone.Summary:
Summarize: I was 25 at the time and had divorced a few months prior. After my divorce I went into full manwhore mode. I'm a decent looking dude, 6'1", 205#, dirty blonde hair, blue eyes, I'm no gym rat but I have a job that keeps me active all day and in good shape. I'm 3rd wheeling it at a bar with my friend and his GF. We are getting shitty drunk (an every night thing for me at the time) and his GF says "I think my friend is coming to hang out with us." Cool, the more the merrier. About 20 minutes later her friend shows up. We will call her T, for the sake of anonymity. T is about 5"2 in heels, 100#, fiery green eyes, and a strawberry blonde. She was a solid 8.5 on a 10 scale when sober. In my condition she looked like an eleventeen. She orders up a vodka and red bull, and I exchange my empty beer for a fresh one. All 4 of us are chatting and laughing. And I noticed she touched my arm when she laughed...always a good sign. By the end of that round my friend and his GF wanted to shoot some pool. They get up to go grab a rack of balls and pick out some cues. As they left the table she leaned over, put her hand in my crotch and started rubbing my dick. She looks me in the eyes and smirks. "Follow me". Being the gentleman I am I oblige without question. She grabs her purse and leads me to the women's bathroom. Well by this time the fuckstick is at full mast and we go into the handicap stall. I close the door and lock it and she sits down on the toilet. I walk over and she unbuckles my belt, unbuttons my jeans, pulls down my boxers and starts giving me some violent head. She is deep throating and gagging. Spitting on my dick and jerking with the fervor of a porn starlet. She has my undivided attention. She pulls my member out of her mouth and asks if I have a condom as she continues stroking my crank. FUCK! "Nope, but I can go get one." She reaches for her purse sitting on the railing and fishes one out. Perfect! She hikes up her dress and pulls off her lacy little black thong to reveal a beautiful slick shaven pussy with a finger-width landing strip. She throws the soaked panties in her purse. She stands up, turns around and has one foot on the floor and her knee on the toilet seat. There, in all of its glistening glory, was my perfectly presented prize. I push myself into her and she starts cooing. I'm in awe that I'm full on fucking some woman that I've known for the course of a beer...fuck it. Trim is trim, and I'm in. I'm balls deep in T and rage fucking this girl. Balls slapping clit, she's moaning, and the rougher I get the more she soaks my rod and wails. She's a screamer. I give zero fucks at this moment. I hear the bathroom door opening and closing, toilets flushing, hand dryers cycling on and off...it doesn't phase me one bit. At times I hear women's voices...not T's and some are whispering, some laughing...I don't pay attention or acknowledge their words. I am completely zoned in on fucking the living shit out of T. It could have been two minutes since we began, it could have been an hour. Time was lost to me at this point and in my condition. She's moaning and screaming to god...there is no god here, only a sexually explosive man in the throes of a post divorce, self serving, fuckstravaganza. She lunges forward as I feel myself crashing into her cervix...she is trembling and shaking and tells me she wants me to come in her mouth. "Turn around". I rip off the condom dripping with her juices and shove my lube and precum covered dick into her mouth. She starts bobbing her head and fiddling with my balls...wham! I come like the fury of 1000 badgers spun out on crank, deep in her throat. She half chokes, half coughs, and the next wave of semen comes pouring from my member into her mouth. She continues to stroke me and squeeze my throbbing dick and coax every last drop from me. "Fuck yes! Let's get a drink and go shoot some pool!" She said through smiling lips, my once erect member shrinking in her hand. I pull up my boxers and my jeans as she takes a quick piss. She dries off and stands up. "I'm not putting my panties back on, they're soaked and I would just have to take them off again when we get home in a while." I wash my hands and as we exit the women's bathroom. There stands my buddy with a full on shit-eating grin, his girlfriend, and half a bar-full of strangers. My buddy hi-fives me and everyone is laughing cheering and clapping. I exclaim "who needs a beer? I need a smoke!" T was smiling and laughing, she wasn't embarrassed in the least. We stayed at that bar until closing. I got my tab for the night and it was only 12 bucks. The bartender said that a bunch of people were paying for my beers all night. And that I better not pull that shit again in his place. Fair enough. T and I were fuck buddies for a while but that all ended when she caught up to me at the same bar and I was with another woman. She got pissed and dramatic, and went completely left when I reminded her that told her I didn't want anything exclusive.Summary:
Summarize: I've tried most of these "tips". But nothing actually works better, than having at least 5-8 hours of sleep, 6 being the sweet spot. You wake up feeling rested and you automatically just WANT to get up. Also don't turn on your lamp. Go from darker to lighter gradually, your eyes will hate if there's a bright light after solitude in darkness and you'll just hate everything and hide your head under the pillow and sleep in. If you wake up, open your eyes and stare at the ceiling or something, until you feel like your eyes are open, then you can turn on the light and proceed with morning activities. So if you're dead tired, and you only have 3 hours to sleep. I'd just recommend getting coffee or use some energizer and go in like a zombie and sleep properly the night after. Otherwise you're potentially risking on sleeping in, no matter what the trick is, in addition to not feeling rested. **Summary:
Summarize: It was the matinee hours during a very slow week day while working at the movies. A rather overweight woman comes hobbling in with her husband. Actually no; a morbidly obese lady. Anyways, they go to see the movie Battleship. About halfway through, I see her exit the theater, walks as fast as her fat legs can move her straight to her car. My co-worker and I find this slightly precarious. We decide to exit and sneak around stealthily to watch what she was up to without her husband. BAD IDEA. She began disrobing I kid you not (it was a struggle inside a car for a woman her size). Once completely naked, she gets out of the car, layers flapping and all. She proceeds to perform the fucking rain dance. In the middle of the parking lot . My friend and I were petrified yet laughing our asses off. We ran back in without her noticing and got her husband who was in the main area looking for his wife. We told him she was out there and all that we saw. His exact words were, "Oh dear god not again."Summary:
Summarize: We have been together for about two years, in the beginning the kid was okay, then when me and my boyfriend had started having some trouble he just automatically hated me (super immature) and literally just wouldnt talk to me, was a complete jerk right to my face. this past summer we broke up for just about the summer and then decided to get back together. during that time he literally slept over and spent every SINGLE DAY with this kid... they are 26 years old.. now that we are back together i dont hesitate to say something when his friend pisses me off, but he literally never sees it. when i bring something up he'll either brush it off and defend his friend saying "thats just how he is, thats why he doesnt have a girlfriend" or "ive already said something to him about it a million times" but he will NEVER defend me in front of his friend... is it just me or is this relationship a bit extreme? and i am not the only one who thinks this, all of the friends that we hang out with think their relationship is pretty weird and they are together and texting ALL the time.. i know people have their best friends and shit, but am i wrong for being pissed off when he doesnt defend me or say something to the kid?Summary:
Summarize: EDIT - Just got into a fender bender... HA - what luck. This is why you don't talk of inauspicious things. i was driving home from college a few years ago. i was physically exhausted - had class, then work, then a 2.5 hr drive to my mom's house. and i was mentally exhausted - i was being harassed by a guy at work, i was going home to break up with my then-boyfriend, and i had started to see a guy up at college - all stressful shit. my friend is meeting me halfway, luckily - she offered b/c she REALLY wanted to see me, and i didn't fee like driving that far. i had just gotten off the phone with her, and started mulling over shit on my head...when all of a sudden i'm veering toward the median of the highway. the road was slick, and i over-corrected the wheel, which caused a lock up of the wheels i guess, and i started to spin. i'm slamming on the brakes, obviously..i finally stopped on the other side of the road, in a ditch, facing on-coming traffic. i get out, survey the damage - i hit a mile marker, which skidded across the hood, leaving a big gouge, and the impact of the mile marker on my headlight literally blasted the entire light out of the socket. it was gone. i found out later i also lost the cover that goes under the front of the car. ( fun fact - i had 3 accidents with that particular car, all in the exact same spot, the front/driver's side wheel well area) i call my friend - she tells me to get in the car, keep driving, she's 20 minutes away. and i do. its not until later when i'm taking some stuff out of my car that i realize that i could have just killed myself driving - or someone else. what made me realize this? i have a rubber duck on my dash. i found it in my backseat, under my seat, after the crash. i imagined it flying around, final destination style. and i was like - whoa. =) i keep that duck on my dash now because it reminds me of my almost fatal accident. and that if i'm tired fucking pull over!Summary:
Summarize: Hey r/sex! I (20/m) just wanted to share a little something I have been testing out for the last couple of days that I am sure you will be interested in! Slight Backstory: So I, like many men, have been disappointed with how long I last in bed, although some times (1 out of every 10 or so) I last longer than my SO (20 f) can handle for whatever reason. Sometimes I can go for days, cum 2 times and still pound her until she screams and goes limp, while others I shoot one off after the first 5 minutes or so and cannot get it stiff enough to go back in. I wanted to make myself last longer, and be more consistent all around (i.e. last 7 times out of 10 longer than my SO), so I have been testing a few different things. One thing that has been extremely successful thus far is what I like to call the Backfire Technique: About an hour or so before your anticipated sexual encounter, begin masturbating and edge (i.e. get close to orgasm) for a little while without actually cumming. I have been edging for about 7-10 minutes for the past few times. It takes practice, and you might go too far. Here is where it gets interesting: Make yourself cum, but without cumming. To do this: slow down while masturbating as you feel yourself about to orgasm. Right before you blow your load, squeeze directly below your head VERY hard, and I mean VERY hard! If done correctly, you should feel your penis pulse like you had an orgasm, but no (or small amounts of clear) fluid should come out. After your pseudo orgasm is complete, release and take a break. Almost no fluid should come out after you release either. When you go at it later, you should last significantly longer. I did this last night and it took my SO about 15 minutes of sucking my cock like she needed it to survive to make me orgasm. Then after I came, we continued to have PIV in multiple positions for over 30 mins until she could not take any more. Tell me what you guys think, and I will answer any questions you have ASAP. If you have the time, try it out for yourself and post your results. I am very curious to hear if this actually works with others!Summary:

Summarize: you're speaking my language. i was discussing with my room mate tonight that, despite the success of andy reid throughout his tenure with the eagles, it may be time for him to go. he asked me if i could really measure what we've done as 'success' under him or if it was mostly due to donovan and the rest of the great players we've had over the years and i honestly don't know any more. the breaking point for me is hearing fucking redskins fans compare this underwhelming, disappointing team to the shitshow they have going on right now. in all honesty, with better playcalling and coaching, we could easily have been a top tier team if not the most obvious contender for a superbowl this year. instead, we're this.Summary:
Summarize: This is a bit over due, but things have been crazy! I had my 35 week check up on November 14th. Everything was great. Had my GBS swabs done & heard bub's heartbeat. My attending physician asked if I wanted a cervical check done by a student. "Sure, why not?" It would be my second one this pregnancy & how else will a student learn without practicing. (First one was done after going into the ER for spotting, turns out my cervix was being irritated from sexual intercourse.) I was told I was 1 cm dialated & my cervix was still hard. Good, little guy had 4 weeks to go still. I wasn't due until December 18th. That Saturday, my boyfriend & I went out to dinner to celebrate our 3 year anniversary together. We did some baby shopping for clothes but planned to do the rest later. We were making bets on when bub decided he'd come. I said 2 weeks from then & he said 3. Boy, were we in for a huge surprise! On Monday, November 18th around 7:00 pm, I noticed bub wasn't moving as much as normal. I was a little worried but decided to eat something sugary & wait 30 minutes. If he still didn't move, we'd head straight to the hospital. He started moving, but still not as much as I was used to. I figured he might be getting cramped in there so I'd wait until morning to see if I still felt uneasy. If I did, I'd call my doctor to see what they would recommend I do. The next morning, November 19th, my 3 year old & I woke up around 8:00 like we always do. Got ourselves dressed & bundled up to take my boyfriend's younger sister to the bus stop like we do every morning. 8:28, time to head down the street to get to the bus! We walked like we usually do if it isn't too cold. By the time we got there, I started to feel a little crampy. I wrote it off as not having breakfast yet. Get back home around 8:40, pop in some Toaster Struddles for us & start eating. By 8:50, I feel like I if I poop, I'll feel better. While I'm in there, I lose my mucus plug! I go to lay down & drink water because I'm still feeling crampy. 9:00, I call my OB. I told them I just lost my mucus plug & I think I may be having contractions. I know it can be weeks before anything happens after losing your mucus plug. I'm told to wait an hour & see if I have 8 contractions, or what I think are contractions. (I was induced with my first. I went from having no contractions to heavy ones, then an epi. Never had little ones.) I was to call back in an hour with my results & be told what to do from there. They honestly felt like menstrual cramps. I call my boyfriend to let him know what's going on & then my mother. At this point they're becoming a little more painful & closer together. My mom told me to go to the hospital NOW because I was in labor. Nope, complete denial on my end. 9:20, I now have had 8. I call my OB back to let them know & I was told to head in to be hooked up to a monitor & have a cervical check. I'll never have that cervical check! I call my boyfriend to let him know I was told to come in. He thinks I'm being over-dramatic, but will take me in. 9:30, he still isn't home & these things are killing me! I'm yelling & carrying on. My poor 3 year old is freaked out. He runs to get my boyfriend's sister. She comes downstairs & I tell her, I think I'm in labor. She starts packing my hospital bag as I lay on the bed waiting for my boyfriend to get home so we can head to the hospital. 9:40 he's home & I'm in total bitch mode. I'm hurting & yelling at him to hurry up. When I wasn't having a contraction, I was apologizing to them both for yelling & being rude, but I was hurting so bad I couldn't control it.9:45, we get in the car. We were going to take my car (leather seats,) but couldn't find my keys in all of the chaos. We take his instead (cloth seats, oops!) He loads up the hospital bag & my boppy pillow & we're off! The next part is very jumbled & I don't remember the times of these events. We get on the highway, the hospital is about 15 minutes away. I'm still contracting & they're becoming more intense. I can feel his head going lower & lower with each contraction but I'm telling myself, "Hold out, we're almost there, don't have this baby in the car!" When we're about 6 minutes from the hospital, I feel him crowning. I tell my boyfriend I feel his head & this is about to happen. I unbuckle myself & rip my pants down. Blood is everywhere in my pants & it's just dripping on to the seat. Next contraction, I start pushing. My water breaks & out pops his head! I push hard one last time & he comes out completely. I grab him & turn him over so I can see his face. I sit back down, grab my jacket, wrap him up, then start beating his back to get him to breathe. He cries a little & starts turning pink. At this point, I'm completely calm. I feel nothing but joy! While all of this is going on, my boyfriend is still driving! We're 3 minutes from the hospital. He calls 911 to let them know what has happened & we were told docotors & nurses would be waiting for us at the ER entrance. Well, L&D is closer so we go there. He parks in the valet drop off & runs inside. He tells the security officer what has happened. They both take off to the welome desk. Within 2 minutes, our car is surrounded by OB's & nurses. They're talking to me, asking how I feel. I felt great, grinning from ear to ear. My little boy is right here, in my lap. They clamp his cord & daddy gets to cut it from the driver's seat! Woosh, my little boy is off to be checked out. They help me stand up out of the car. I tell them I have pooped myself & it's everywhere. They tell me they'll clean me up once we're inside. Up I stand, blanket goes around me, & my placenta falls out. The nurse caught it like it was niothing! I am out on a gurney & wheeled upstairs. My boyfriend is following behind with my bag. Just in complete shock. We get upstairs, baby is being cleaned up & examined. Everything is just perfect with him! He's an amazing little guy. Liam Conor; 6 lbs, 14 oz, 19 inches & 4 weeks, 1 day early! We also guessed he was born around 10:10, not completely sure though. I had a first degree tear that I got stitches for. I also got a shot (don't remember the name) to help with clotting. My boyfriend then gets to hold bub while I'm being stitched up & I get to look at him & touch him. Once I'm stitched up, it's time to eat. He nurses for an hour straight! We finally get a chance to call family to let him know he had been born. Everything was perfect. I had my labor like I wanted. Natural & just my boyfriend & I present. Best birth I could ever ask for.Summary:
Summarize: Not having such a narrow view of how things work may help you (maybe not you specifically) be a better player and not require changes to suit that narrow style. The one thing consistent in Elder Scrolls, since Arena (ignoring Redguard) has always been, versatility beats narrow. It's one of the few things ESO did right. > Rogue is a classic RPG character that wears leather armour and focuses on stealth & dexterity, dealing high single target damage to enemies from stealth and all kinds of tricks, such as restealthing/vanishing, different stuns, incapacitates, blinding powder etc. In other RPGs. This isn't a typical RPG, this is Elder Scrolls. There are no classes (outside of ESO and Arena) in this world. A "Thief" is just someone who picks locks, a "Warrior" is just a guy with a weapon. There are no classes, only roles. Your role is whatever you are doing at this exact moment. > The reality in ESO is, that you cannot play a character similar to what is described above. Yes, you can. People do it all the time. They aren't good at it because they cannot switch roles into something else when the time calls, and thus get crushed. They fail to get the quick kill before their opponent gets up they become completely unable to fight back against them, as they've used all their resources. > Restealthing or vanishing in combat is not possible for anyone but Nightblades via Shadow Cloak, Not true, there are two ways. Potions and Line of Sight. Duck behind a tree, stealth up and you're good to go. This doesn't work near keeps but they were designed to 'protect' their area thus preventing stealth. In the open world this works beautifully. Potions also give you invis, not every person in the game carries detection potions and if they do they rarely have them 100% at the ready. Pop invis, go stealth and most times you're fine. If anything this shouldn't be possible. > Sneak attack damage on live is the closest resemblance we have to the classic rogue/assassin gameplay Because 1 shots are fun for everyone involved... There is no reason I should be able to top 3700 damage from a single stealth shot. (Not including Heavy attack cancelling, thats one single hit) This isn't balance, this is dumb and needs to be fixed. Just so happens not many people know how to do it, so it's kept in check. You also lose any ability to actually fight, so its a gimmick at best. > Due to lack of reliable crowd control (as they can all be broken) Not everything is strictly CC. There are other ways to mitigate damage besides CC. > ... that they do not match the dmg shield spam or healing. Shield Damage (Blazing Shield/Frag Shield) can both be mitigated by moving away. I haven't been killed or heavily damaged by a damage shield in a LONG time by learning to move away. > The burst damage seems to be going away, which is the only aspect of rogue/assassin gameplay we currently have. It isn't going away, it's just being toned down to not 1 shot people anymore. Plus it's not even the damage that's dangerous from stealth, its the stun that happens. Focusing only on your damage numbers is a great way to miss everything else that happens in a fight. Hell it's one of the reasons I recently killed myself to razor armor, I didn't watch, I was just focused on dealing damage. It got me killed, and a good lesson to pay attention. Lets take Rock Paper Scissors. You REALLY FUCKING LOVE Rock. Rock always wins, so you always play rock. Fuck Paper, they cheat. Rock beats Scissors, but loses to Paper. For weeks you're beating the crap out of Scissors, then one day you meet up with Paper and they smother you. You get pissed, res and go after them again. Again they smother you. So instead of picking up some Scissor skills and cutting the paper, you keep smashing your head into paper and they keep on suffocating you. Every 'good' build in existence (that people who complain about these types of things generally hate because they want to make their 'own' build ignoring all other information), especially dueling builds are all built around one thing: Be able to do everything. Don't give yourself a weakness on purpose if you can avoid it, doing so will only end in Paper smothering you. Take this to heart and change your style to match the mechanics, then things like stealth damage being reduced won't even phase you.Summary:
Summarize: For many of the reasons already stated by other commenters, this is a BAD science article. This website, especially its science/tech section, really is NOT a news site. It is some outspoken blogger who writes without thinking. These websites are particularly dangerous because they sell themselves off as news sites and gain masses of readers who, without knowing any better, believe anything written on the site. The reason that legitimate biotech companies such as Monstanto (which has a huge entomology section DEVOTED to studying the effects of their seed on insects in the ecosystem) have such a hard time defending themselves against articles like this is because Monsanto is a company that must hold itself to certain standards. Blogs like this one have NO STANDARDS and can simply publish anything they'd like. Monsanto can't defend itself by simply pointing out, "All we do is sell seeds. We have nothing to do with this. Here are our latest field tests to prove that we are not killing your family." It's the American public's responsibility to become science literate so we don't get tricked by articles like this.Summary:
Summarize: Skating on Campus. Just starting to learn. I was going waaaay to fast downhill, and tried to lightly put my fut down to slow myself down, as I had seen several other skaters do this successfully. Well, it wasn't successful for me. Foot touches ground, board STOPS, and I fly forward in full flip mode. However, I was flying hard enough forwards, I actually pulled a full flip and landed on my feet. Que adrenaline rush. I feel like a BADASS. Look around.....NO ONE IS THERE. I angrily stomp off, retrieve my board and skate off like nothing happened.Summary:
Summarize: I'm not a big guy on drugs and I stick strictly to drinking , weed and wax. I haven't binge drank in a while but occasionally I'll have a beer at work. Anyway, I've been smoking alot of weed and weed based products and fall in the category of a heavy smoker and recently bought a vape pen and have been buying vape tanks filled with thc oil so I can do it in public without having to worry about pigs but I think I have become super tolerant as I've been doing it like I've been doing it almost all day like breakfast, lunch, and dinner and during work and school...I've been using the pen for just about under a month and have bought 3 tanks each has lasted me about a week and I've been using the last one I got less and less for two days now hoping for the best! Now the pens barely grazes me and if I do want it to work I need to use way way more and these tanks aren't exactly "cheap" so I wouldn't call myself stingy, but I don't want to use way more than I needed before but yea was wondering if anyone had any tips or ideas or knew more about this stuff idk maybe I might have just gotten shitty tank disposable at the dispensary but like I said idk. SIDE NOTE I live in L.A. just thought I'd mention that and have been smoking for 3 years going on 3 in like 5 monthsSummary:
Summarize: Had 2 tabs each earlier this night with my gf snd our friend. Went to a park which is located on a hill. The view to the city is amazing. I was laying next to a small(ish) lake. Pelicans, ducks and some other water birds chillin', swimming around there. And the frogs quacking. Holy fuck how trippy it is to hear hundreds or even thousands of frogs quacking simultainiously. I was tripping there for at least 2 hours straight. It was amazing. Finally got home. Had a shower, because it's so damn hot. Got into bed next to my gf. When I suddenly felt sick and had to vomit.(I tend to get really nauseaus indoors). Brushed my teeth and back to bed! My gf soon fell a sleep(she had to wake up 1.5 h later to go to work). So here I am, left alone with my thoughts. The fan in the corner of my room was making this sound. It's quite trippy tbh. I switch it off just to switch it back on 5 minutes later(because it's so damn hot here). Here I am thinking and going through all the apects of this life, my life. When I suddenly come to a conclusion that I have to quit smoking. It was time for my gf to wake up. We snuggled, had sex. I made her some coffee. She had a cigarette and drank her coffee(only the half of it, we have so many cups half full laying around at the place). Off she went. I'm laying in my bed as I write this, and I have to say: I feel fucking amazing! Just something I wanted to share with you guys.Summary:
Summarize: Fuck man. It's like... Yahweh said the Jews would get their holy land back in BC. But it took until the fucking 60's before Israel. HP/Valve said we would get silencers back when we were in beta. So, who knows if we will get them tomorrow, or in nineteen hundred years. And even then, we may or may not have to engage in some holy warfare/war crimes.Summary:
Summarize: So, I just downloaded Fate Stay Night and have been playing it for a couple of days. I did so at the behest of many people claiming that it was superior to the animated version. This was also my first time playing a visual novel, so I figured it would be a good start. Before playing, I laid down some ground rules for myself. I was going to choose decisions that I would make if I were in the same situation. Simply put, I was going to make rational decisions and go only off of what would be presented to me in the VN. With this in mind, I start playing. The first two hours were pretty darn boring, but I didn't hold it against the game. It was mostly just a prologue where I didn't actually make any decisions. The game picked when we went to see Kirei. After listening to Kirei talk for awhile, I got, what I would call, my first meaningful choice. Fight or Quit. Keeping with the theme of making rational choices, I chose to quit. The chances of me winning the war were slim to none, and defeat meant death. It was the obvious choice. I tell Kirei my choice and break the news to Saber. I then proceed to walk home. I figured at this point the game would contrive a sequence of events that would force Shirou into the holy grail war. Just as I was thinking that, a wild Illya appears. She greets me by having Berserker . Then I get a line of text reading BAD END. Before I can even regain my composure, I'm sent to the Taiga Dojo. There I meet Fujimura-sensei and the girl who just splattered my guts across the pavement. They inform me that cowardly decisions will result in more deaths. With this, I turn off the game and go to bed.Summary:
Summarize: Well for starters your hair will be minging as fuck. I've read your's and other people's comments and I'll just say that you're not washing your hair properly. As your hair gets dirtier and as you get a build up of products (if you use any) you are creating a barrier on your hair, shampoo removes said dirt and product build up thus removing any barriers on your hair. The reason as to why you're developing a curl is because there are coils in your hair that can be manipulated to change the shape of your hair temporarily (like using straighteners/hair iron or curling tongs), these coils can be reset by washing the hair with water and shampoo. I will assume that you've developed a curl because of your sweat that's lead to the manipulation to the coils and because you are not properly washing your hair the barrier that's now covering your hair is preventing the coils from reverting back to their natural state. I like you have naturally straight hair and once I was at the gym working out, I built up a big sweat and when I finished I put on a hat to walk home in since it was cold out. When I got home from the gym and was preparing to go for a shower I took off the hat to find that my hair had become wavy, this is something that doesn't usually happen as my hair is naturally poker straight. I'll also note that the reason most people find that they no longer have dandruff when they stop shampooing their hair is because the dead skin is not being shifted off the skin by the shampoo and thus the dead skin is building up on their scalp. You don't have to wash your hair everyday, in fact it's not good for your hair if you wash it every day since doing so rids your hair of it's natural oils. It's best to wash your hair every 2-3 days as to not rid your hair of it's natural oils but also keeping it clean in the process.Summary:
Summarize: Yesterday, I broke up with my GF of 2 years. Well, I teid really... it was so intense at the end that I could only manage to say I needed time away from her. It wasn't a rushed decision on my part but when it came to explaining my reasons, I deflated like a balloon. I left her because we were both what seems to me incompatible and we are both seemingly unwilling or incapable of changing any further. She is very religious (catholic) and I'm not but that was something we could work out. She is a bit racist, but she won't admit it. She needs me arround more than I can be there for her, and only alone time counts for beeing together in her mind. She always says that my friends will never be her friends and we don't share any hobbies. Everytime I left the house to be with friends., wait, I mean, most of the times, she would make me feel guilty for it. Sometimes she even resorted to emotional blackmail to get me to stay. Sometimes I did stay. We talked about it several times, but I need my time with friends and my time alone for contemplation, and she needs more time with me. I feel lie the past few months both of us have been unhappy and fighting constantly. I just felt that this couldn't go on. We each had one puppy. She left yesterday and took hers with her to her mom's. I'm off from work today and now my puppy is whining looking for her lil bro. It's not easy.Summary:
Summarize: OP]( Thanks to everyone who helped me out :) As I said in the comments I decided to move my stuff out the next day, I then told him to meet me in a cafe on his way back from work. I began by telling him I found something on his computer. Instantly he had expression of 'oh shit' on his face. He said 'what did you find?' I was like 'how about you tell me?' He said he didn't know. I got annoyed, like was there more than one thing etc etc. Eventually I just told him about the youtube, and some particularly disgusting things he said. He just completely shut down while I was listing all this I was just demanding an explanation and yelling why and stuff. He just shrugged and said he didn't know while looking at the table. I asked him if it was just for fun, if it made him feel better about himself. He said he didn't know. "So this is it? You have nothing to tell me. I can't be in a relationship with someone that thinks this is okay" "I don't think it's okay" "Why do you do it then? Please just tell me" I nearly lost it at this point. I was just begging for an explanation. He eventually just broke down and told me that it was like he became a different person. He told me that what I saw wasn't him. I said I was sure there was a better way to take out his anger. He just said he didn't know why he did it, and he promised he'd stop. I told him I couldn't be with someone who tells a girl she should get raped. He just started crying and begging me to forgive him. I told him it's not me he needs to apologise to. He told me he would apologise to all the people he harassed and delete his youtube account and never do it again. I expressed that I didn't even know him if he could hide this from me. I didn't know which version was the real one. I said that my stuff is already out of the flat and I had to leave. Honestly it was more difficult than I thought. He was so apologetic. I said he should get therapy but I don't know if I could forgive him even if he sorted his issues out. So that's it, I'm back at my mum's house and he's sent me a few texts but I haven't responded, I don't know what to say to him.Summary:
Summarize: I usually fix my car myself but when my car died on the highway I had trouble figuring out it was the distributor that needed replacing. from the highway I had it towed to a garage because I had no time to fix a car and went to get the car the next day. The guy replaced the distributor a $150 part. He charged me $800. I explained that I know how to fix cars and I know the prices of parts because I have replaced a distributor before. Not even 10 minutes of politely saying "fuck you" and he charges me $200. That is still a $100 profit for that garage but I was happy with that price, paid and left. I've rebuilt engines, replaced suspensions, gutted interiors and fixed rusted floorpans, replaced multiple brake systems, built a turbo system for my current car and I'm currently doing a headgasket on that car so I do know my shit for the most part. I just could not believe the first time in years I don't fix my car myself I get that shit pulled on me. never again will I go to a garage for anything I can do myself.Summary:
Summarize: Met a guy[25/M] that I [26/m] liked, and he didn't feel the same. Nbd, it's not fun to deal with but it's part of life. Put on your big girl panties and deal with it. We were friends for a year or so, but after a few rough patches the friendship slowly deteriorated. Our friends mingled, so I saw him around and everything, but I never felt comfortable initiating conversations. He always initiated, and whenever there was too much silence or time gone by without contact, he'd send me a message or whatever. Towards the end of our friendship, however, he was absolutely desperate to speak to me. I mean he wasn't crazy or anything, but it made me super uncomfortable. I kinda want to know what it was like to be in his shoes, but we're not really talking. (I've tried :( he's not a huge fan of serious talks). Why would a guy who has lots of great friends, and is seemingly popular with the ladies react like this? I'm pretty great, don't get me wrong, but I had nothing to offer him from his point of view. We were never sexual (don't think he had intentions of trying), we weren't best friends, and I just...irked him sometimes. That's what puzzles me the most, I seemed to get on his nerves all the time, and he wasn't interested in me, but he didn't respond the same way when I backed off.Summary:
Summarize: This is a hard one. The bf has so many amazing qualities. Smart, driven, hard worker, hilarious. Our personalities mesh very well and we both feel intensely attracted to one another. As an (important) aside, his sole surviving parent is in the hospital (soon to be hospice) with stage 4 cancer and there is no good prognosis. Obviously, this has been a really difficult time for him. Where I'm struggling is I'm suspecting there may be an alcohol problem but I can't tell if it's circumstantial or long term, or really even the magnitude of the issue. I asked him if there was an issue and he said there may be and it has been particularly bad lately with the grief. But he also seems to suggest there is really nothing wrong with the drinking. He's highly functioning and it's not impacting him during the day. He asked me what would be wrong with him drinking and having never dated someone with this issue, I stumbled in my response. I basically said any type of addiction is bad, his health would be impacted (his liver etc) and that I just simply can't be with an alcoholic. I know I can't handle it. I like the sober version of him and I just don't want this to be an issue in my relationship. I don't feel like I responded the way I should have. It's as if I completely missed the logic on why being an alcoholic is bad because don't we all just know that it is? Anyway, can anyone shed some light on this? Do I try to figure out the magnitude of the issue first to see how had it is? Do I try to revisit the conversation armed with more reasons as to why it's bad? Do I accept this is a particularly painful time for him and see what happens after? How does one know if someone is an alcoholic during the initial dating period?Summary:
Summarize: So, I am 26 and have an above-average penis size -- at least from what I have read in various publications. I'm a little over six inches, good girth, never had any problems with my tool. I've been in a relationship for the last eight months, give or take. My girlfriend is great, the love of my life. We get along amazingly and along with that comes the best sex of my life. Really, sex with her just keeps getting better and better -- and we do it a good amount. Some days we will have sex two or three times, but every time we are together (we don't currently share a residence) we usually fornicate at least one time. In the past couple months, my girlfriend keeps saying that my penis is getting bigger. I always say, "Ha ha, yeah right. I wish," but I am not a physiological expert nor am I one to just let things go and not think about it. Her reasoning is that nowadays, I get really hard all the time. My penis is like a cobblestone, or a jackhammer -- whichever you prefer. It's on another level and I am actually wondering, is my penis growing or is it just functioning at a sexual peak? My girlfriend must have a lot to do with this. I honestly don't masturbate all that much (couple times a week), but I have been having sex since I was 18 and I have never been this hard this often. My penis feels like a super penis, at least to me. So, is it crazy to suggest that a penis can grow after 26 years of living? It's almost like one of those things, when you hear it so much for so long, you start to wonder if it could actually be true. If I'm crazy for even thinking that, I would appreciate that feedback as well.Summary:
Summarize: As I turn on my tv I realize ice misplaced the remote:o. So I use my LG G2's built in virtual remote:O (cue advertisment) and after countless seconds of on and off failure to operate the television correctly enough to switch inputs I become flustered and rise to face my foe. Striking his late 2010 button design fiercely with ny finger "I win again." I approach bed and get lost in the channels, navigating the endless possibilities of what I could watch all while I am viewing the mess of a current channel before me, which is cheaters. My navigation soundtrack is constant argument and" hoe ain't shit" every half a minute. One time he said it 3 times in a row. Then he tries apologizing to one of them and says "it is what it is". Great. Next I attempt to put on Ted fated after a struggle with entering the channel that lasted a good ten minutes. I get trapped in a wormhole along the way and I'm spit out on channel 444. Insane. I vibe for about an hour and then decide Netflis on xbox is better. after alternating direction and force on the remote and buttons I decide" fuck it" and fall back pressing the input button and shwoop clan as fuck no lag that bitch pop the fuk up.0_0. I press it again and sure enough, If I lay down where I lay down. It works perfectly. I had been trying too hard the whole time. I geek the fuck out and immediately relate it to 16 current life issues and solve them all. :'Summary:
Summarize: Yes, which is why I added the Disclaimer. It's worth noting though, if we're going to go at it objectively, that KVM hasn't really got much of an "emulation pipeline", not unlike Xen. QEMU is basically just used to bootstrap the system, everything that actually matters (IO of any kind) is done with pv drivers, which are a thin passthrough interface to the host incurring negligible overhead. The CPU is just virtualized using what amounts to hardware assisted hypercalls, which also have a negligible performance impact. Memory is allocated by the host kernel. Add to this the actual downsides of OpenVZ, namely that you get a shitty vtun/tap for network IO on which you can never do anything more than throw packets at the other end of the tunnel (i.e. no filtering/firewall, no vpn, nothing), that your container shares a kernel and all its modules with the host, and that it's near impossible to properly isolate or prioritize any vm with any semblance of granularity, and the arguably present performance advantage seems rather insignificant. I use containers for some things, but I certainly wouldn't use them for everything just because it's theoritically faster in a negligible proportion that doesn't really affect my workload.Summary:
Summarize: I know I'm late to the party here but I got a Weber Genesis E-310 about this time 2 years ago on a Father's Day sale from Amazon. It replaced a shitty old propane grill that had side-side burners instead of front-back like the Weber. The Weber also has a much easier time heating up to 3-450F and keeping it there evenly. Also, the Weber can smoke pretty damned easily. I have done probably about 7 full-sized Boston Butts in mine thanks to the front-back burners. The Weber can get to 225F and keep it there almost without fail with one burner on one side and the shoulder offset on the other side. It handles the smoke well also as it has a low-deck lid which completely envelops the shoulder with smoke. It's not as good as a purpose-built smoker, of course, but it can smoke. It's honestly the best money I've spent in a long time. Completely worth it. When you're getting a grill, get quality. A friend of mine also had a Jenn-Air that he found out didn't have a catch tray that went under the entire width of the grilling surface. Some olive oil dripped onto his propane line and ignited the feed. Luckily, propane tanks have blowback valves so the propane was merely ignited in a jet shooting out of his grill but it completely destroyed his wiring system and effectively destroyed his grill. The Weber has a a cast-iron lower that completely encapsulates the grilling area. The upper lid is cast-aluminum and is quite heavy. It's very sturdy and hasn't shown any rust (has been outside in the high humidity US South). The cast-iron grates have also kept up very well.Summary:
Summarize: Any girl I try to date. Usually gets on my shit list within a week. They lead me on. Pretend to really like me.(even saying I really like you) When I ask them on a date they just say oh I don't know what I'm doing that day. IF they do say yes they do so excitedly and then stand me up. Its really annoying and hurtful and now I am afraid to ask girls on dates because I'm tired of it.Summary:
Summarize: I was sitting in my car, about to pull out of the driveway to head to school at about 6:30 in the morning. It was pretty dark and foggy, so I couldn't see well. I check twice to each side, and let off the brake. All of the sudden a car appears, slams on its brakes, and stops at the same time I stop to let the person go. The guy starts driving to pass in front of me, but he STOPS in front of my car so his face is illuminated, and I can see this death glare. Then he squeals off down the road. I was pretty shaken just from that, but then I forget that the road is a circle, and I go the way that passes where the circle lets out. He's pulling up to the stop sign as I'm almost at the intersection, and seeing as I had right-of-way (no stop sign) I continue at the same speed. Now get this, the guy starts knowingly pulling out, so far that by the time I was passing in front of his car, he almost hit my car. Never in my life have I met a driver who was that fucking mean and threatening. Mind you, this was all before the sun even rose.Summary:
Summarize: You punch the computer wall of your makeshift hive again in frustration as your husktop proceeds to freeze up. You were damn sure your programs would actually succeed at preventing stuff like this freezing up your computer, but you have to admit to yourself, you were always a lousy programmer. You were far more mechanically-minded. You stare blankly at the familiar fist indentation in the machine next to the husktop for several more moments before you go about and begin to captchalogue most of your possessions. You were about to embark on a trans-Pacific voyage, after all. As you marked a spot in the archaeologically potent environment your sylladex always automatically generated, to store one of your --Dooms--Day --DeviCes in that spot, you pondered the ways you might arrange for transporation to Australia. If you remembered correctly, Australia was across the largest ocean that could possibly divide two continents on this planet. This meant swimming was far too time-consuming an option, as was waiting for an Alternian transport ship or searching for a teleport pad. This planet was very backwater, and seeing how it hadn't been conquered yet, neither of these extraplanetary resources were abundant yet. You suppose you could travel to the big airport at Human Albuquerque or the big seaport at Human Los Angeles and stow away on one of the primitive means of human transport. Yes, that's what you'd do, and you were always most efficient at avoiding detection, so infiltrating either port would be no problem whatsoever. As you automatically bury your collection of books, you look fondly at the spot you always hid your DATA-WIPER, the small remote control-like device you used to wipe any signs of your presence from the primitive, easily manipulated human technology. This had to be your proudest and most prized invention yet. You then proceed to captchalogue your BROKEN RC LEGO MILENNIUM FALCON (piece of shit that it was), your entire collection of skulls, bones, and other archaeological artifacts, various machine parts, other half completed projects of yours including several incomplete doomsday devices, the INCOMPLETE PROTECTIVE SPHERE GENERATOR, and the INCOMPLETE JESUS JUICE SERUM. Unfortunately, for both of these latter two, positively aligned projects, you'd hit major blocks while constructing and were stuck. You simply couldn't build any more doomsday devices without completing any protective devices as well; without protective devices as well, not only would your doomsday devices potentially kill you as well as their intended planets, but your KARMATIC EQUILIBRIUM would be thrown completely out of balance. You had to take care to guard both the gates to hell and to heaven equally, lest uneven devils or angels escape and achieve dominance. Now that you're at the bottom of this overly-wordy post, you're pretty much completely packed prepared for later archaeological rediscovery, save your Husktop, which you left out just in case it decided to cooperate. As you check on you husktop's responsiveness, you try to sense where Wolfmom has gotten off to, carefully listening and sniffing the air to see if you can detect her.Summary:

I never filed a claim on my Gnex, but my sister paid $80 to have her Moto Razor X replaced (I think that was the model, claimed to be the best android battery lifed phone at the time ) after she cracked the screen.. Now they want $170 deductible? Just cancel that fucking shit, man what a rip off. I cancelled mine. All that money you pay them you could just buy a new phone, plus its water resistant and with the $20 tempered glass protector, you dont really need them anymore.

Summarize: Okay so a few weeks ago I posted on here saying I needed tips making out as I had not done it much before and when I had I had been hammered out of my face. Turns out I was just being a big pussy and it was easier then expected just like every other time. Anyway last thing I posted was asking advice for making out as I was going to a party and thought there was a strong chance of hooking up with this one girl who I thought was hot and we had some connections in the past when drinking and she had showed interest in school the days before the party. Well anyway fast forward to the party and I admittedly got hammered as shit and kind of forgot about the girl I was originally going to go for. I recall saying to my friend "That chick (didnt know her name at that point) is the hottest one here by far and Alex (fake name of another chick from my school that we both knew) is the only one competing"... So the gist of it was I thought this one chick was banggggging. Anyway, this is a pretty big detail here. Earlier that night I was upstairs with my buddy (and this is why im asking you guys to not call me a dick which I am in this case) and we found a pack of smokes in a cupboard. In my drunken state I took them and we went to the garage to smoke. I took a couple rips and gave my friend some cigarettes (I dont smoke other than the odd puff at parties) and he sparked up. The hot chick I was talking about (Ill just call her Jenn from now on) comes into the garage and was asking if one of us had her cigarettes. She sees that my friend was smoking one and asked what kind it was. It was her kind. She starts getting pissed and asking where he got it from. My friend is the worst fucking lying on earth and start changing his excuse and stuff so she pats him down on him front pockets and thankfully ignores me when in reality I had them in my back pocket and I was standing up so she probably wouldve felt them if she searched me. Anyway she had two guys in there who gave her a cocky nod saying theyve got her back so I was ready to tilly but these are all side details that have nothing to do with the post. Point is, I took her cigarettes and she was fiending for them all night. Came in a bit later to garage and friend was smoking another one and she started flipping but at that point I had the cigarettes hidden well in my bag so we were fine. Anyway fast forward back to modern time (at the party) I just said to my friend how hot I thought the chick was and the party goes on whatever just chatting people and drinking etc. Then near the end of the part (like 2:30 or 3:00) I finally meet the chick who I stole the cigarettes from and thought was hot as shit. I was drunk like I said so I had my typical drunk confidence going and sweet talked her for a minute. A different friend of mine comes straight up to me while im talking to this chick and says "Hook up with her" right in front of our faces. Ahahahahahaa. Anyway I go to talk to whoever else and help clean some shit up for the host. Two of my buddies say "Maaan you have to hook up with her" "She wants to hook up with you" and typical shit buddies will say that I take as a joke. This chick is waaaay out of my league. Anyway though I go back to the room where she was and she was on the couch laying down. She asks if I wanted to sleep with her (like literally sleep not bang) and I said yeah Im gonna go help Host out though again for a bit. Anyway I tell my boys whatsup and they tell me I have to hook up with her etc. I was being a big pussy about it though and was like "Naaah we are just gonna sleep" and then they lectured me and said I had to and she wanted me etc. My buddy hands me a condom which I did not think in a million years I would use that night. So fast forward like 10 minutes I go back to the living room where she is and ask if I can still sleep there, to which she replies "yeeeesss". So I hop onto the couch and we just kind of cuddle there for a sec. Host comes into the room and turns the light off and say good night to us, and the other group (one guy and girl on the other couch). We got up for a sec to see if there was anywhere better to sleep in the basement and shit but literally every room was full and the basement was freeeeeezing. So we go back up to the couch. Anyway lights turn off and within 10 seconds she flips over onto me and starts making out. We make out for a bit and shit got more intense (Im guessing I shouldnt go into details here??) but she asks if Im a virgin and I respond I am and laugh and ask if I should bother asking her. Also forgot to mention this earlier she is a year older then me which I figured out in first conversation with her. Anyway I thought she was just asking me about virginity in case or whatever, but I played my cards right. After making out for a while and then (again dont wanna get into too much detail because I feel like a dick saying it here) fingered her and had her shirt off. She states "Oh Id feel so bad" and I ask about what. She says because Im a virgin. And I respond Im not asking you to do anything dont worry. At that point I was happy that I even got to hook up with her and knew I would get crazy props from friends as she was a solid 9.5 with big jugs and ass. Anyway like I said she says she would feel bad but I kept going with her and then she just straight up said I wanna fuck. You get the idea of where it goes from there. Since Im 16 I know you dont wanna know details but anyway I banged her and lost my virginity but was too hammered to stay hard. (HOLY i feel like such a dick writing this here). Anyway thats the update to the story. I went to the party thinking I might hook up with an 8 and ended up banging a 9.5. But the only reason im even posting this is because I have a couple questions. Ill be straight up with you ive been texting her and think it would be sick to hangout with her after school everyday and blaze a bit and bang. I could make this happen easily after talking to her and if I did we would basically be fuck buddies with no strings attached. Now id say im relatively smart and do a lot of reading and everything and will always take any advice when I can get it from anyone who is more experienced/has any advice to give. 1. Is there anything (short of stds) that is wrong/bad about this? And please dont say my age. 2. If she were to figure out about the cigarettes should I just straight up tell her exactly what happened and that I wanted to give them back at that point but it wouldve been too awkward and my chances wouldve been ruined? 3. Do you guys have any other advice I should know before I do this? 4. Any insane heath risks other then STDs at this age because of sex? I mean of course there isnt but still its worth asking. I will take everything into account and if anyone has any crazy point that should change my mind about trying to be FWB they probably will change my mind. I am trying to have fun here obviously but if it isnt the smart thing to do I wont. Thank you for reading and honestly I will probably get downvoted to shit for this one because I came off as such a dick and because of my age. I just wanted to tell the story how it happened. Even if I get one piece of advice I am thankful for that. Since everyone is asking::Summary:

Summarize: Jax' complete disregard for authority or rules, and the mystery behind him. He had no Judgement or Reflection, suddenly this guy no one has heard of before is just there . Not only is he there, but he makes it clear that he's the best Champion by a long shot, so they put special restrictions on him. As a giant "fuck you" to the man , he mocks their petty handicaps and starts using a lamppost as a weapon. Nothing slows him down, he still stomps, despite the fact that he has no weapon, no history, no faction, no confirmed species even. He has purple skin, only a few fingers and toes, and he probably has a bunch of blue eyes, but there's no way of knowing that for sure due to the hood. A couple of hypothesis stand out to me. His lack of background and his clothing cause some people to think he's the world's most badass minion. It would also explain the lack of Judgement and Reflection, because obviously minions don't go through that process to participate in League matches, right? My favorite theory though is that he is somehow related to Baron Nashor. The visual similarities are apparent, and they are respectively the strongest monster and champion. MY wild idea is that Jax IS Baron Nashor. The monsters in Summoners Rift are just copies of real monsters that are summoned for the matches. Baron in particular isn't necessarily accurate because the only evidence that the League had of the creature was a scale and verbal descriptions from tales. When the Summoner's Rift was constructed, the real Baron just dissappeared . What purple skinned, blue eyed creature just appeared in the League RIGHT after that? BOOMSummary:
Summarize: One Million Moms is a religious organization that hates gays. Every week or so, they send out a notice to their mailing list subscribers to notify them of companies that support gay and lesbian rights. In the email they provide a link to contact the heads of those companies and complain. I've found this mailing list to be a fantastic way of finding out which companies are supporting gay and lesbian rights, and being able to immediately voice my support to these companies directly through the convenient link provided by One Million Moms! Recently I've used their own website to write encouraging letters of support to Oreo, DC Comics, and JC Penney for their brave stance in support of gay rights. Their link pre-fills a subject line and email body with anti-gay hate speech and boycott threats, which you can easily delete and replace with your words of encouragement! Tell these great companies that you stand with them in their support of the LGBT community and use the One Million Moms' own resources against them!Summary:
Summarize: I'm currently enrolled in a communications technology course. Let's just start off by saying it's mediocre to begin with, and quite frankly rather ludicrous, ill structured, and a terrible learning environment. Just to give you a slight insight into the course, the equipment that the teacher gets us to use is not only out-dated, but chances of you coming across such brands in the professional field are rather small. Since the majority of the students within the class have an average knowledge of technology, and don't use their computers for anything more then facebook and YouTube, he can usually get away with telling kids that what he has it top-of-the-line and this is exactly what we'll be using the pro field if we decide to get into such a career path. Out of the 20 or so kids within the class, it's pretty much me and 1 or 2 other people that know a little better, and have actually been exposed to the current professional field. I hate sounding egotistical, and imposing a superiority view on the rest of the students, but let's face it; I have gotten the exposure and experience to be able to have an opinion like I do and be able to back it up with a valid argument. I could go on, and on about this class for days , but I'm beginning to digress from my root question, so let's get back to it... The teacher has often accepted the kids who he has had previously in his class (who he liked... Often girls) as his co-op students. He has one for every semester, and he praises some of these kids for doing so well in his class. The current Co-Op student who he has is (surprise, surprise) a female. In my opinion, we're on a pretty similar intellectual level as far as graphic design goes, but (again, I don't mean to sound egotistical) I believe that I have a slightly more advanced ability in audio production. One day, I was sitting down on MY laptop, working on a backing track for one of our videos. I've been fooling around with some DAWs (Digital Audio Workstations) for a while now, and I have seem to come across one that best suites my needs not only for our project, but also when I want to whip something together using samples. I'm working away, minding my own business, when she comes up behinds me and tells me to get off of it, I have to use the software that he tells us to use and nothing else. So, I get into a heated debate with her. I'm giving out logical questions on why I should get off, and she's basically saying the same thing over and over again, just using different words. I ended up just closing it and sat there for the rest of the class, seering with anger. The next day, I open it back up and start working on something that has NOTHING to do with this class as I had done everything I needed to do. She comes back over, tells me to turn it off. I comply after a few comments, but this time go to the teacher where he explains why he would like it best if I use the software he tells us to. He has decent logic behind his reasoning, and I respect it, and use the software he outlines. The next day, I'm still done everything, so I open up Reddit on MY laptop, turn on MY hotspot on MY phone, and start browsing. She comes over, and tells me to get off. At this point, I'm pissed, but do it anyway. A similar circumstance occurs about 4 - 5 times a day now, and often times, I'm not even doing anything wrong. She's power hungry. I know it doesn't sound like a big deal, and I MAY be over-reacting, but I was seering with anger at that point as well. So, my question. Can she legally, tell me what to do, within the classroom? It's not just me either. I see her all the time flexing her muscles, telling kids what to do and not do. I'm fed up with it. I want to submit some type of review on her, but I don't know if that's possible or if there's anything for that. When I went into that class, I was ready to listen to the teacher, not some stuck up co-op that's power hungry and rude. Oh, she's not even 1 year older than me either. I'm sorry this is so long...Summary:
Summarize: I recently broke up with a long-term partner. It was a drama-free breakup and I'm OK with what happened. I'm now curious and eager to meet new women and see what experiences are out there. I met a really nice girl online and we've been talking a lot. We went out on one date and it was good. We're meeting up again tomorrow. I am not ready to jump into another LTR or officially have a girlfriend. What I'd like is something like a FwB, a person with who I can share good conversations, fun activities, good sex, but not become intertwined in each other's lives too deeply. My question is, when should I tell her this? Right away? Wait to see her a few times? I don't want to lead her on, I am a very honest and respectful person.Summary:
Summarize: It is a pejorative for selling that which should not be sold, selling to those that should not be sold to, and going to lengths to make oneself attractive specifically to those that should not be attracted. This applies to male prostitutes as well. "Whore" is usually used synonymously with "slut." Whatever else the words mean, they are widely held to be a way of "shaming" assertive women, particularly those who are sexually assertive. I appreciate that this is what you mean when you say, "whore," it is not what the majority of people will think when they read it. Combined with her level of sexual activity and whatever she may or may not get in return for it being completely irrelevant to her appalling crime, it sounds like you're not just "slut-shaming" (god I hate that phrase but it's appropriate here, in that I'm pointing out what others, especially women, will infer) but piling on as well. >And you mean to tell me you'd not have called me out for calling her that?! I don't believe that for a microsecond. Probably. But I think the part you're missing here is that I'm not trying to "call you out"-- I personally took no offense. I'm trying to call your attention to how your words come across. >it is horribly offensive for you to reduce this cause to that of a PR campaign. I didn't mean to "reduce" it to anything. Everything you just mentioned will only be gotten through winning hearts and minds, both of men and women who have been fed this kind of thing so long that the men's rights stances on these issues, as sane and rational as they are, seem like extremist anti-women positions. You guys need to get more men on your side than just the ones who have been through the hell of a false rape accusation, losing their kids, or being taken to the cleaners in divorce court.Summary:
Summarize: So my GF(F,18) and I (M,19) decided that on my trip back home from University that we were ready to lose our virginities to one another. Both of us had a good amount of experience with oral and everything before this relationship but neither of us have felt ready to have actual intercourse with someone until this point. So on Friday we have our first time and it's fun but due to time restrictions didn't last very long. During Saturday afternoon she comes over and we have sex for an hour..It was very surprising to me because even with the intensity she wasn't in pain(she said just a bit when I went all the way in), and we tried multiple positions (also something I was surprised worked so well the first time). Anyways I drop her off to hang out with a few of my friends before spending the night at her house and end up smoking quite a bit of weed. I show up to her place high as a kite and we get it on right away. Here's where the concerns begin, we go at it for 30 minutes and I noticed my dick wasn't getting hard as it usually gets but it's just hard enough to work and all goes well and i cum. Usually after I cum it takes me only about 10-15 to get hard again. But it took much longer and even after blowjob/handjob my dick wasn't getting hard enough to able to go in again. It was kinda hard but would bend. So I end up cumming two more times with my oddly not hard enough dick from her help. I figure we can sleep and wake up and I'll be all hard like I normally am. I wake up and same not being able to get hard enough situation. I thought maybe it was just the weed causing the ED but i had done sexual things before while high and had no problems.. before this I have never had any problems being able to get hard, I've had nights with her before where she would make me cum 4 times throughout the night and no problems with hardness. It's now Sunday and I'm back on campus and my dick hurts (which it has before the morning after a night of it being tugged) and it still feels off. I try to get hard in the shower and it's the same situation! I'm very concerned and something about it feels so off. She's planning on coming up this weekend and I'm nervous that this will still be a problem. I have jerked off more than normal leading up to this past weekend ( once day sometimes 2 times) but I've done more in the past and had no problems. Could this be a desensitized issue? I'm so confused and don't plan on touching my dick all week. Sorry for the wall of text, I've been a member of this subreddit for over a year now and have learned so much from you guys (communication is a key theme here and that helped me get her to have multiple clitoral orgasms) can you guys help tell me what could be going on?Summary:
Summarize: Well said, thank you. I would never tell anyone to 'get over it' when they're the target of 'humor' based on hurtful stereotypes and I would appreciate it if the same courtesy were extended to me within my own community It took me a long time to come to this same understanding, and for a long time I was one of the same sort of people who would shout, "Oh come on, get over it" etc. I realize now that that's a profoundly unfair request to make of someone, and often a hypocritical one, as we've all got our sore-spots and touchy issues. It doesn't reflect well on us when we forget that fact and get hostile with others for expressing their feelings because sooner or later we're likely to be in the same spot, and greatly resenting anyone who gets hostile and tells us that our feelings don't matter. We should recognize that it's not a transsexual becoming upset by a joke at the expense of transsexuals, but the fact that there is a strong culture of alienation marginalization and stigma attached to transsexual people in our culture that is the underlying problem here. If we work on that, then we'll end up having an awful lot fewer sentiments of offence to get upset over when transsexuals don't laugh at certain jokes that many of us may otherwise find to be both hilarious and in good humor. It takes a bit of distance from tragedy before it can be safely laughed at, after all, and that sort of distance from being treated like they belong in a freak-show is a luxury which transsexuals in our society presently do not enjoy.Summary:
Summarize: My friend has a cabin with a pond next to it. It was basically our school's party spot when there was nowhere to drink. Well, a few of my friends went out there during the summer while my parents were away, so I figured, no problem, I'll go there, pass out, and drive back whenever. I thought we were gonna drink beer, but there were only so many left, only got four. Then someone pulls out a bag of weed, and the cabin kid suggests we go smoke on the rowboat. Weed guy mentions this being some strong shit. We're all just chilling smoking out a bowl. Spoilers: it doesn't tip. When I say this was strong shit, I mean, it was on steroids, possibly literally. Cabin guy suggests it was laced jokingly. He hardly got anything out of his hits. I like to watch smoke in the air, and his were definitely too inadequate to be feeling what I was. I started staring deep into the water, sweating quite a bit. It wasn't just the sun, my heart was racing. Other weed smoking friend says that he definitely thinks it was laced. Told us our source wasn't the regular guy he goes to. Shit starts getting weird for me here. I'm no longer lucid, I'm completely mind blown and out of it. Someone's asking if I'm okay. They sound like a mile away. I start to frown, but I don't know why. I look over at my should which feels red hot. There's a motherfucking horse fly straight up and down biting into my goddamn shoulder. My screams and yells get everyone's attention. Cabin kid yell "HOLY SHIT!" I'm unsure if that's what alerted me to the fly or if it was after, but now he's telling the story of how it landed there moved around a ton, bit a little, then a little more, then the thing was straight up and down practically humping my skins while biting. I could tell I was too high. I remember drinking a ton of juice and water chilling in the cabin for a while then waking up in my bed at 5 pm the next day covered in sweat.Summary:

I finally built up enough courage to ask her on a date and she agreed. I asked her to dinner but she already had plans. I thought I was out of luck until SHE suggested that we should hangout after she is done getting dinner with her friend. I was excited. She texted me and told me she was almost done and she will let me know when she gets back. I answered her with "Alright let me know." She never responded after that and we never went on the date.Summary:
Summarize: I was on the back of my friend's cart getting a ride up the fairway. About halfway through the ride, I realize that his driver is stuck inbetween my driver and my hybrids. With one hand still on the roof, I start trying to get his driver untangled from my clubs. While I'm fiddling with his driver, he hits the biggest bump in the fairway. I get launched about 2 feet in the air, and fall straight back to earth. I land on my ass in the middle of the fairway and pop up faster then you'd imagine possible belting out "No one saw that!" My other buddy walking yelled, "saw what?" at which point I just kept walking down the fairway with my buddy's driver in hand. edit;Summary:
Summarize: Edit 1 - Just clearing a few common comments up: 1)We are not planning on having kids; I have a vasectomy scheduled. 2) I'm not appeasing the besty, I am appeasing her and bestie knows she isn't religious, knows I'm an atheist. 3) Everyone knows I'm an atheist, except the dozens of people in the prep program, including our priest counselor. Everyone (I think) hopes this will be some kind of re-conversion experience for us. Ha. Edit 2 - to try and give a more clear picture: I say "besty" but she hangs out with this person every other month at best. Probably talks to once a month. They are good friends, but it's not like he's going to be this big ongoing influence Original Post Follows: Bit of a rant, but I wanted to tell someone. My alt-account because of friends on reddit that don’t need to know this… I’ve agreed to this for her sake, and I’m going to be lying through my teeth for the next few months to dozens of people while going through marriage preparations, and more importantly I think, while saying my vows. My family is Catholic, my fiancée’s family is Catholic; they all want us to be married in the church, obv. More importantly, one of my fiancée’s best friends is a deacon in the church, and we are going to be his first wedding. That’s why this is her dream wedding. I have been an atheist for about 16 years, and I think my extremely conservative Catholic upbringing (homeschooled and Catholic school for 12 years, forced to attend mass and confession…being taught about the “homosexual agenda”, science education suppressed, living with constant guilt, etc.) was the single worst thing that has ever happened to me. Fiancée is a deist, and she is well aware of the resentment I harbor against the church; she is very grateful I’m doing this, and while I mind, I am willing. The marriage preparation within the church is nuts! For starters, we’re being counseled on how to live in our married life by a celibate man only a couple years older than us. We’re being sponsored by a “Canaanite Couple” (a married couple within the parish), that we get to have all kinds of friendly dinners and activities with while discussing why their marriage is so much more meaningful and stable than secular couples (it’s not). We’re going on a weekend marriage counseling retreat with other engaged couples to learn all about marriage within the church and “Natural Family Planning” and why actual effective contraception is sinful. Getting back into this indoctrinating echo-chamber, that is so obviously homophobic and so so so structured around traditional gender roles is strange but familiar to me… I’m lying to all of these people. It’s convincing because I am so familiar with the Catholic mindset, doctrine, etc. I’m going to continue this for months, and then I probably won’t see any of these people again after the wedding because I think the church is a net force for evil in the world even if it was all true, and I don’t want to associate with it. I don’t even feel bad about it, except that bailing after getting married might give atheists (or whatever they think I am) a bad name. Also we’re not giving the church any money except a $300 booking fee…which I think is reasonable.Summary:

Summarize: Though I'm a straight guy, I feel the need to comment. I'm a little heavy set, so I'm probably getting bad reads, but I'm like 5 1/2in length and 5 1/4in to 5 1/2in girth. The majority of women only feel so deep inside their vagina, and after a point it becomes unpleasant and even painful. I could be wrong, but the number I heard was 4 1/2in inside. If your hitting the end, I can imagine she would'nt feel too good. IMO, that's why it's better to have a average length but thicker penis. bang up the walls, don't knock out the bottom. AND, a girls weight matters. You're gonna be able to get more in on a skinny girl. on bigger girls, there's more fat and it's harder to go all the way in. it just is, your path way is blocked by their legs, unless you get creative with positions, and yknow that's another story.Summary:

Summarize: I'm a guy of slightly larger than the "average" genital size (~6.5-7" length, 4.5" - 5" circumference)going by wiki , but just a bit over. The smallest porn star would easily put me to shame. Even so, if I wear standard-sized condoms my bits get so constricted width-wise that I can only wear them for a short time without being in real pain. They almost act like a cock-ring(keeping all the blood inside and keeping me erect even after intercourse) but a cock-ring that is too small. I've tried trojan/durex/lifestyles and just about any other brand of regular sized condoms I can find in stores. The only couple I've tried that actually seem to fit properly are Trojan Magnum, lifestyles "XL", or lifestyles SKYN "XL" I think they are called. Buying them has problems too because of the stereotypical person that buys a magnum condom (the usually young, immature type that wants to show everyone he has a big dick, sharing it on facebook and anywhere else he can post a picture). Even in the military I think it was they had to reissue condoms with sizes renamed because the soldiers would only take magnum-sized condoms when passed out for free which lead to the magnums running out and no one taking the regulars. There is also a great deal of hate both off and on the internet for anyone buying magnums b/c hate the above-mentioned stereotypical buyer and people feel the standard size fits all because condoms can stretch. Well, yes, they might stretch if you apply some real force to them, but they don't stretch like that simply by putting them on your penis. Does anyone else have this particular problem? Are there condoms out there that are just a bit wider without me needing to buy the less-than-modest Magnum packaging?Summary:

Summarize: Madara starts off his history lesson [here]( by talking about how mankind fought way before learning about chakra. When you look at the Sage, you notice that he has a pair of horns. Sure enough, Kinkaku and Ginkaku, who are said to be his descendents, also have a pair of horns. And on the page after the one I linked, you'll see that the Sage's mother also had a pair of horns. There certainly seems to be something going on with being a descendant of Kaguya and having horns. Yet when we look at the Uchiha and Senju ancestor, they don't have horns. One of the stranger things I noticed about the whole Sage story is that his two sons just happened to perfectly divide up his power. One got his body and one got his eyes. I'm beginning to doubt that the Sage just got a woman pregnant and had these two children that complimented each other so well. Instead, I'm beginning to lean towards a theory that I've read around here before: the Sage used the creation of all things to create two sons who perfectly divided up his power. Because the Sage used the Creation of All Things to create new life out of a fraction of his own chakra, the Uchiha Ancestor got a mutated spiral Rinnegan instead of a normal one. So why not create just one son with both the eyes and the body? Most likely, the Sage worried that if he started this "chain of Sages", somewhere down the line, one of them would become evil and use the power for wrong things. So he divided his power into two beings that would keep each other in balance. So then what about Kinkaku and Ginkaku? If they are descendants to the Sage, are they Uchiha or Senju? You might lean towards them being Senju because they don't have special eyes and because they had tons of chakra, but consider a third option. The Senju clan isn't said to have tons of chakra. The Senju ancestor was said to have inherited the Sage's life force and physical energy. You can have powerful chakra without having tons of it. The best example: Tobirama Senju. That guy is pretty damn powerful but he can make at most one(two?) shadow clones. Clearly, large amounts of chakra are not a trait of the Senju. But large volumes of chakra are characteristic to the Uzumaki. I'm thinking that the Uzumaki are the actual blood descendants of the Sage, the ones that were created through normal reproduction. The Sage taught this "third" child his sealing techniques to compliment his other two sons. To sum up: the Uzumaki are the blood descendants of the Sage while the Uchiha and Senju are chakra creations. If that were the case, it would mean that Ginkaku and Kinkaku are Uzumaki. You'll notice that neither have red hair, which is a trait characteristic of the clan. But Naruto is an Uzumaki without red hair as well. Why do Kin and Gin have horns? Probably for the same reason why Hashi has mokuton. There are some descendants of the Sage who are born with a far stronger resemblance to the Sage than others. As for Obito/Naruto/Minato's Jinchuuriki horns, I think those are a product of just having tons of demon chakra. Notice that one of Obito's horns was smaller than the other, caused by the fact that he did not have the entirety of the Juubi's chakra. So those horns are clearly related to the amount of chakra you have.Summary:

Summarize: I get a call from housekeeping about some crazy drunk girl knocking on the door to the HK laundry at 23:00 on Friday night. I put on my MOD jacket and call security to meet me at the scene. I find a 6'2" 40 something, who can't stand on two legs. She's banging on the door to the HK laundry room and screaming for someone to let her in. I asked, "can I help you ma'am?" She replies, "no, it's okay, I've been here for a while." I ask, "well if you've been here, can I look up your name and find your room, or if you are staying with someone else, can I have their name?" She gave me a confused look and then looked at the laundry room door like it had all the answers. She said, "I'm just gonna wait here for this door." I tried to reason with her until security showed up, at which point I said, "Ma'am, you are not making any sense at all. Unless you can you show me a room key, or tell me a name and room number for your friend, I need to ask you to leave the property." She decides to leave the property at this point, but she goes the long way through the parking lot. On the way, she thinks she is going to take a pit stop in the conference center via the handicap ramp. The security guard and myself both warn her not to go that way, but she does anyway and eats shit about two steps up the ramp. We help her to her feet, at which point she starts cussing us out and calling me a "rude son of a bitch," and then we set her in the chair in the carport. Since she fell, I had to try my best to take an incident report, but she refused medical services, she wouldn't give me her full name, or phone number, she would not, or could not tell me anything about herself or why she was at the hotel. I told her that I had to call either, a cab, the police or an ambulance for her. She didn't like any of those so I offered to let her use the desk phone (I'm a softy, I know), while she's calling her husband long distance on my phone, she continues on about how the staff at the hotel is so rude and she hasn't done anything wrong (queue the tears). I had originally offered to let her wait on my couch in front of the lobby, but after she called me a "sonnovabitch" the third time, I kicked her to the curb and told her that she could wait for her husband out there. She comes back inside ten minutes later with a room key and a name. "My friend is Jane Doe and this is her room!" This is where it gets interesting for me. I had dealt with Jane Doe earlier that day about some leftovers that housekeeping cleared. I offered her an appetizer at the restaurant to make up for it. Her reply was, "that's it?" I looked her room up and found out that she's staying on an employee rate for longer than the maximum number of nights that are allowed in a year. Now it's my job to be the asshole who makes sure that this employee is charged for the full amount due, and reported to the parent company and their employer about the misconduct of one of their friends. I don't want to be that person. Why do people need to make me that person.Summary:
Summarize: Well, I mean, if you want to completely and totally minimize effort to lay ratio, get a hooker. If you're trying to pick girls up, your mileage may vary based on your personality and natural aptitudes. For me it's basically anything but a bar or a night club. You could try online dating but that's more of a numbers game, and you also have to wade through a sea of fatties and flakes to get to the attractive girls. Of course, anytime you are dating women you have to deal with a sea of flakes, so that should be something you inure yourself to. The thing I've had most success with is day game. It helps if you live near a source of hot young tail - say, a college town - but you could do this probably anywhere that isn't a podunk town. It's simple: anytime you see a cute girl that you really want to talk to, man the fuck up and go say hi to her. Don't give yourself a chance to pussy out about it (and in the beginning, your brain will come up with endless reasons for you to bail. Just go.) Speak slowly and deeply. If you can't think of something clever or charming to say to start a conversation, that's fine; there's a "routine" I use. I don't really advocate for the use of routines, but this one is okay because it can be as short or as long as you want, and you can lead it wherever you want. Literally just say "Hey." Then, after they respond, hold your phone out to them and say "put your number in my phone." If they ask why, say "because I said." I have, like, an 80% success rate with this right off the bat. If she says she has a boyfriend, you can usually talk that away too. Very occasionally you'll get a bitchy girl, but whatever - you can maintain frame and just say something like "sorry, I thought you would be better" and walk away, no big deal. If you're up to it, you can often turn the better interactions into an instadate - depending on the girl's body language or whatever, you can continue the conversation, perhaps even making it meta by referencing your own straightforwardness in a "yeah, I just did that" sort of way (demonstration of your own higher value without seeming like you're bragging). Otherwise, you can disengage move into text game in a couple days. Text game is extremely low effort; if you really want to, you'll find yourself easily getting dozens of numbers in a day, weeding out the obvious flakes over the next few days, and going on a bunch of dates with the top picks the next week. Now, this is something that has worked regularly for me. Obviously straight up copying that particular routine might not be the best choice for you; the biggest takeaway you should have from this post is that you need to actually approach attractive chicks without hesitation. If you're walking down the sidewalk waiting to cross the street and a hot chick is standing near you, swallow your approach anxiety and just fucking say hi to the bitch. As long as you don't look like a total creep, most women are not going to act like cunts right off the bat; remember that the more alpha you behave, the better women treat you. Day game extends to a lot of other facets of your life; if you really wanted to, you could put yourself in certain coed spaces which lean towards a lot of women being there. A yoga class, for instance. This depends on how much free time you have - these days I'm pretty busy running my businesses, so I prefer my hobby/leisure time to be taken up by shit I actually want to do. But if you can find a hobby you enjoy and there happen to be a lot of chicks that are involved too? Hunting time. I know this post ended up pretty long, so again,Summary:

Summarize: This is a bit over due, but things have been crazy! I had my 35 week check up on November 14th. Everything was great. Had my GBS swabs done & heard bub's heartbeat. My attending physician asked if I wanted a cervical check done by a student. "Sure, why not?" It would be my second one this pregnancy & how else will a student learn without practicing. (First one was done after going into the ER for spotting, turns out my cervix was being irritated from sexual intercourse.) I was told I was 1 cm dialated & my cervix was still hard. Good, little guy had 4 weeks to go still. I wasn't due until December 18th. That Saturday, my boyfriend & I went out to dinner to celebrate our 3 year anniversary together. We did some baby shopping for clothes but planned to do the rest later. We were making bets on when bub decided he'd come. I said 2 weeks from then & he said 3. Boy, were we in for a huge surprise! On Monday, November 18th around 7:00 pm, I noticed bub wasn't moving as much as normal. I was a little worried but decided to eat something sugary & wait 30 minutes. If he still didn't move, we'd head straight to the hospital. He started moving, but still not as much as I was used to. I figured he might be getting cramped in there so I'd wait until morning to see if I still felt uneasy. If I did, I'd call my doctor to see what they would recommend I do. The next morning, November 19th, my 3 year old & I woke up around 8:00 like we always do. Got ourselves dressed & bundled up to take my boyfriend's younger sister to the bus stop like we do every morning. 8:28, time to head down the street to get to the bus! We walked like we usually do if it isn't too cold. By the time we got there, I started to feel a little crampy. I wrote it off as not having breakfast yet. Get back home around 8:40, pop in some Toaster Struddles for us & start eating. By 8:50, I feel like I if I poop, I'll feel better. While I'm in there, I lose my mucus plug! I go to lay down & drink water because I'm still feeling crampy. 9:00, I call my OB. I told them I just lost my mucus plug & I think I may be having contractions. I know it can be weeks before anything happens after losing your mucus plug. I'm told to wait an hour & see if I have 8 contractions, or what I think are contractions. (I was induced with my first. I went from having no contractions to heavy ones, then an epi. Never had little ones.) I was to call back in an hour with my results & be told what to do from there. They honestly felt like menstrual cramps. I call my boyfriend to let him know what's going on & then my mother. At this point they're becoming a little more painful & closer together. My mom told me to go to the hospital NOW because I was in labor. Nope, complete denial on my end. 9:20, I now have had 8. I call my OB back to let them know & I was told to head in to be hooked up to a monitor & have a cervical check. I'll never have that cervical check! I call my boyfriend to let him know I was told to come in. He thinks I'm being over-dramatic, but will take me in. 9:30, he still isn't home & these things are killing me! I'm yelling & carrying on. My poor 3 year old is freaked out. He runs to get my boyfriend's sister. She comes downstairs & I tell her, I think I'm in labor. She starts packing my hospital bag as I lay on the bed waiting for my boyfriend to get home so we can head to the hospital. 9:40 he's home & I'm in total bitch mode. I'm hurting & yelling at him to hurry up. When I wasn't having a contraction, I was apologizing to them both for yelling & being rude, but I was hurting so bad I couldn't control it.9:45, we get in the car. We were going to take my car (leather seats,) but couldn't find my keys in all of the chaos. We take his instead (cloth seats, oops!) He loads up the hospital bag & my boppy pillow & we're off! The next part is very jumbled & I don't remember the times of these events. We get on the highway, the hospital is about 15 minutes away. I'm still contracting & they're becoming more intense. I can feel his head going lower & lower with each contraction but I'm telling myself, "Hold out, we're almost there, don't have this baby in the car!" When we're about 6 minutes from the hospital, I feel him crowning. I tell my boyfriend I feel his head & this is about to happen. I unbuckle myself & rip my pants down. Blood is everywhere in my pants & it's just dripping on to the seat. Next contraction, I start pushing. My water breaks & out pops his head! I push hard one last time & he comes out completely. I grab him & turn him over so I can see his face. I sit back down, grab my jacket, wrap him up, then start beating his back to get him to breathe. He cries a little & starts turning pink. At this point, I'm completely calm. I feel nothing but joy! While all of this is going on, my boyfriend is still driving! We're 3 minutes from the hospital. He calls 911 to let them know what has happened & we were told docotors & nurses would be waiting for us at the ER entrance. Well, L&D is closer so we go there. He parks in the valet drop off & runs inside. He tells the security officer what has happened. They both take off to the welome desk. Within 2 minutes, our car is surrounded by OB's & nurses. They're talking to me, asking how I feel. I felt great, grinning from ear to ear. My little boy is right here, in my lap. They clamp his cord & daddy gets to cut it from the driver's seat! Woosh, my little boy is off to be checked out. They help me stand up out of the car. I tell them I have pooped myself & it's everywhere. They tell me they'll clean me up once we're inside. Up I stand, blanket goes around me, & my placenta falls out. The nurse caught it like it was niothing! I am out on a gurney & wheeled upstairs. My boyfriend is following behind with my bag. Just in complete shock. We get upstairs, baby is being cleaned up & examined. Everything is just perfect with him! He's an amazing little guy. Liam Conor; 6 lbs, 14 oz, 19 inches & 4 weeks, 1 day early! We also guessed he was born around 10:10, not completely sure though. I had a first degree tear that I got stitches for. I also got a shot (don't remember the name) to help with clotting. My boyfriend then gets to hold bub while I'm being stitched up & I get to look at him & touch him. Once I'm stitched up, it's time to eat. He nurses for an hour straight! We finally get a chance to call family to let him know he had been born. Everything was perfect. I had my labor like I wanted. Natural & just my boyfriend & I present. Best birth I could ever ask for.Summary:

Summarize: I guess this is a personal issue, a pattern I've noticed before. I'm interested in a guy, I think he's attractive/cute, and I want to talk to him, we talk, I meet him, blah blah, and the minute he starts showing interest, I stop feeling interested, just a bad habit. I also push guys away, the minute they start getting closer, that's when it's over. I see it, as "Hey, yes, I want your attention. I would love to have it, and I would love to know you want to get to know me, bc I'm interested in getting to know you. But don't show interest, because it will scare the shit out of me." It's actually pretty weird, because I crave that attention from guys I like, and when I receive it, I'll be like "fuck off, I don't want this". Do you also do that? If you have done it before, and you no longer do it, what did you do to avoid fucking shit up?Summary:
Summarize: So I get to my local smoke shop to buy a new bowl piece, because the other one broke a couple days ago. I buy some cheap one since I only had about 10 bucks with me. Me feeling like I just bought my own island, I wanted to break this piece in, so I proceeded to the beach. Now I get out of the car reaching with my busted wrist into my pocket dropping the fucker right in front of my eyes. After the accident, I went back into my car and sat there in shock, realizing I don't have any more money for a new piece. I was literally seconds away from smoking, now I took the second obvious choice and decided to masturbate until I felt good to drive again.Summary:
Summarize: So heres how it all came about. my gf [18/f] opened my [20/m] laptop one day and reddit was still open, she saw that an NSFW link was purple so she clicked on it. It was just a topless girl and she freaked out, i explained to her that i click all the frontpage links (i do) and she doesnt believe that. anyway after a couple of weeks i thought she had competely let it go...until tonight that is. She was arguing with me for hours telling me that i dont find her attractive cause i look at other girls and that obviously means i think they're better than her (I honestly dont think they are though) and that when i call her beautiful it doesnt mean anything to her. But i think she's fucking gorgeous! Anyway im just asking how can i show her that i do truly love her and think shes beautiful?Summary:
Summarize: They came to my Student's union to do a poor DJ set.

Didn't even get a chat with them.Summary:
Summarize: First time posting on r/relationships, apologies for any format issues etc. I'm a student in the UK in the second year of a three year course, as are my five housemates (mixed gender house, all in our early twenties). We are currently living in a house together, but due to landlord issues we have found and paid a small deposit on a new house for the next academic year. [I'm not sure how similar the UK is to other places, but the standard procedure is first year to be university owned halls, and second and third year to be private/agency accomodation. Student house contracts are locked in for one year, September through to June at full rate, with the summer holiday months paid at a half-rate retainer.] I've been having doubts about next year primarily due to one housemate - let's call her Hayley (not her real name). Hayley is a nice enough girl but is very frustrating to live with. She is quite controlling, uptight and blunt, though it's not malicious, simply the way she is. As someone who is quite social and outgoing, her rudeness and lack of charisma grinds my gears a lot. For example, one of our housemates (let's call him Tom) was having a serious discussion with us about seeing a GP for depression, which she listed to for about thirty seconds, then interrupted to talk about not being allowed to use the new coffee machine at her work. She is only living with us as she had nobody to live with otherwise, and we took her in - a decision I have been, sadly, regretting for a while. However, the other four housemates I have are very easy to get on with, and two of them are what I'd consider very good friends. Hayley's frustrating behaviour is diluted amongst the other housemates enough that it's tolerable, especially by Tom, who is very easygoing and the total antithesis to Hayley's behaviour. THE PROBLEM: However! Yesterday, Tom made the decision to drop out of university for a few reasons, including his aforementioned depression. He's honestly my best mate, and I'm sad to see him go, though I support his decision entirely. It has, however, shaken up my feelings about next year significantly. If the five of us that remain are to stay together in our new six person house next year, we'll need to find a replacement tenant. But I'm more worried that Hollie will drive me to the point of actual insanity, and outweigh whatever plus points there are to staying with the gang now that Tom has left. My other options are to strike it out by myself, either finding a studio flat somewhere (not something I'd hate), or trying to find a group of students looking for someone to sub in. I again, wouldn't mind this second option, being quite easygoing and social, but it is late enough in the year that finding the right group in the right area is going to be a real struggle. Both of these options would leave my housemates looking for not just one, but two new tenants next year - more than likely they would simply have to downgrade to a smaller, different house. I still want to remain friends with all of them (Hayley exempted), and don't want to leave them in a tough situation, but I feel things are only going to deteriorate if I live with Hayley next year. I have a lot of unrelated pressures going on right now, none of which have been helped by any of this! I can't see an obvious solution right now. But as weird as it sounds, I think I just need some anonymous internet strangers to sift through my thoughts and help me build my plan of action. I'm sure I've missed some important bits out, so questions are welcome. What should I do, Reddit? Thank you.Summary:

Summarize: So me and my girlfriend have been together for 4, almost 5 months now. We met through a facebook group, and eventually learned we're going to the same school together. We ended up dating, and things are very good overall. We're both happy, and make each other happy. Except for one major problem. Alcohol. In December she was hospitalized after a suicide attemp on a night where she got drunk at her grandmother's house where she was living at the time. She had tried to be social with her brother's friends (they are completely different people from her), and when she didn't fit in she drank a few beers. She called me after her second beer crying and slurring her speech. I told her to get to sleep and that I'd see her in the morning. 30 minutes later I started getting facebook messages asking me if she was OK. She'd been posting that she was killing herself, and that no one loved her. I called the police, and she was hospitalized for a week. When she got out she said she wasn;t going to drink anymore. She also got a prescription for prozac. Fast foward a few weeks, and she says she wants to try to drink. That it the drinking isn't the problem, and I was OK with that, because I didn't know if it was. So she'd have a couple of drinks here and there, until one night we were out with friends and she just didn't want to stop. I picked up that something was wrong, even though everyone else didn't. I told her that she eneds to slow down, but she got very defensive and acted as if I was just being controlling. After a bit longer I told her we need to go because she can't stop, and she got even angrier, but eventually we left. We had a really big fight where I was just trying to get her home, but she wanted to go drink somewhere else, and mingle with people. This has happened a couple of times since. About a month ago she went out with soem friends to have dinner on a Sunday night at around 5:30. She was going to be back early because I was sick with the flu. By 7:30 I hadn't heard anything from her, and I knew she was out drinking. I mesaged and called her, and when I got no response I asked one of our mutal friends she was with if she was ok. She called right after that, already slurring, and angry. I asked when was going to be home, and she said was leaving around 9. I said ok, and let it go. 9 comes, and I still haven't heard from from her. By then I,m seeing that our mutal friends she was with are home, so I go to the restaraunt that they were at to se what's going on. On the way I'm passing by a bar, and I see her outside talking and drinking still sith a friend of ours. She's drunk, so I close her tab, tell our friend to help me get her in the car, and take her home. Another big fight, her shouting and saying I'm a terrible boyfriend, she keeps wanting to get anther drink. I just let her do that. The next day she's very hungover, and ends up almost missing class. At this point she once again says no more drinking. This past saturday we're out with friends. She says she's going to maybe have 2 beers. She ends up having 5 or 6 beers, and 2 shots. I'm tired of this. She has a drinking problem. She's not the kind of drunk that is difficult to be around, but its the kind of problem where I know she's dependent on the drinking to be able to have a good time. Additionally she suffers from anxiety and the drinking helps her relax. I'm at the point where I don't know what to do. I've tried reaching out to friends, but because they don't know her as well as I do, they just she this social person having fun. Not this person who is chasing this feeling of euphoria she gets when she's with people and drinking. A feeling that she doesn't want to end (her words). She wants to be the kind of person who hosts dinner parties and is able to sip a glass of champagne, and talk to everyone, while not being stupid. But at this point, chasing that is destroying her relationship with me? How do I get her the help she needs in dealing with this, when she can see it, but feels that being this person she isn't is more important?Summary:
Summarize: I was sitting in a waiting room for a marijuana dispensary. There was a dude with cerebral palsy or some other horrific condition who was visiting for the first time. He was in a wheelchair and the budtender was showing him all the different weeds and edibles and trying to help this guy select a good medicine. Well in walks this 20-something dude (picture scumbag Steve) who is obviously purchasing for recreation and not for medication (no big deal in itself IMO). He lets out an exasperated sigh as soon as he walks into the waiting room and sees that there are a couple people in front of him. After sitting down and waiting for maybe 45 seconds he impatiently exclaims "Common, just pick something, I've got places to be!!" He sits there for about another minute while the disabled dude's caregiver is assisting him in paying for his weed, then shouts "Hurry the fuck up, JESUS! " He continued to make remarks like this and gave the poor guy one hell of a dirty look as he was leaving. (Summary:
Summarize: They're actually doing it to wedge between 2A absolutists and hunters. If hunters hear support for their gun usage, their response is "welp, I ain't affected, so fuck 'em," and when the prohibitionists gain hunter support, they split the NRA. It allows them to cast us as fringe. The us/them tactic is a well-used technique of politicians, especially Democrats. Ever notice that if you thought Bush was a Nazi and Condi was an Uncle Tom, dissent was the highest form of patriotism, but if you disagree with Obama's politics or you think Clinton is a horrible Sec'y of State then you're a racist or a misogynist? It's because Us/Them.Summary:
Summarize: So a few nights ago the band I play in spent the day doing a video shoot for an upcoming single. After a very long day and getting back very late we were all somewhat exhausted and decided to leave our gear in the van over night. You can probably guess where this is going... The van one if our guitarists uses for work was stolen along with a hell of a lot of gear from outside his house in Knebworth, Hertfordshire. It would be massively appreciated if we could ask people from the UK to help us out by keeping their eyes and ears open for the van or any gear being shifted anywhere.

Summarize: I have read the last 3 or 4 “creepy threads” and I have always been hesitant to contribute, mostly out of pure laziness, but more so I am really not the “contributing” type. I also know how ridiculous my story really sounds. Unfortunately this did actually happen to me. I don’t post, so I won’t post after this unless it’s to answer questions, most likely. (assuming this doesn’t get entirely buried). I’m mostly doing this because I realized I have never actually written this down and it might be nice to finally do that. Now for my story. Background details: I live in a semi rural area, in a very small neighborhood on waterfront property. The house I live in is surrounded by water on all sides. I have a large yard, to my front and back there are river banks, and to the right there are piers and water access. The two other houses to the right of mine (near the piers) are unoccupied for most of the year, and also at the time of my incident. I live with my boyfriend. His parents own this house, but they live elsewhere, about an hour away. Approximately 3 years ago, I was 20, home alone and in bed. My boyfriend had been away, helping his parents fix their internet (yes and this shit continues to happen all the time and there never ends up being an actual problem with it btw) and he was going to have dinner with them afterwards. I wasn’t expecting him home until the next morning because he had a late start and his mother has a habit of talking him into staying the night. I am a light sleeper, and I awoke to what sounded like a boat engine. Not really that unusual, there’s a lot of boat activity where I am, and my bedroom faces that part of the water, so I can usually hear everything that goes on out there. I checked my phone and it was roughly 1:30. At that point, I did think someone was just a weird asshole out there at that time of night, but I eventually stopped caring and fell back asleep. I remember waking up to the sound of footsteps on our ground floor. There are hardwood floors, so I can hear the entire route someone travels from one side of the house to the other. I assumed my boyfriend had decided to come home after all, and I listened to him move around the house, waiting for him to come upstairs. I had almost drifted back to sleep when I heard footsteps on the stairs. My room is the first room, directly at the top of the stairs, and I leave the hallway light on, most nights. I heard him open our bedroom door, and I didn’t turn over right away. Our bed faces the door, and I was turned on my right side, facing away. I didn’t even open my eyes for a while, I was groggy and I had no idea what he was doing. Finally I realized he still hadn’t come in, because I could see the light through my eyelids and I finally rolled over to ask him what the hell he was doing. There was a man in my doorway, a man that I immediately realized was not my boyfriend. I noticed his hair immediately. He had really long, scraggly hair, and he was much shorter than my boyfriend. I couldn’t see many details of his face at that point, mostly the silhouette from the hallway light. I panicked. I immediately thought I was going to die and I had to get out of there. I screamed, started crying, the whole deal. I have a remote lightswitch, which I am not sure hurt or helped me really, because I then had to see this disgusting man. He looked dirty, and I mean like, actually covered in dirt. Flannel shirt, puffy vest thing over the top, and his eyes were bulging out of his head. That’s the one thing I will never forget. Those bulging. Fucking. Eyes. I looked at him and then realized why he had been standing there for so long. I was naked. I sleep that way, I imagine most people do. If you don’t, you should, but maybe not after reading this. I had panties on, but I was topless. At the time it was warm and I had no comforter on my bed, only a sheet and I didn’t even have the time to think to cover myself when I notice my potential murderer standing in my doorway. The kicker? When I turned the light on, he continued to stare at me…licking his lips. Literally, smacking his lips. It was obvious at this point what his intentions were originally (to rob the place), and what they had just now become when he saw me(to rape me). I jumped up as fast as I could and backed myself up against the farthest wall. I asked him what he wanted. He grunted. That was all I could get out of him, grunts. I had two weapons at my disposal. 1.) 2 20 lb weights. 2.) An electric guitar. I chose the guitar for it’s swinging power and held it up like a baseball bat. I’m sure I looked really awesome at this point. I begged him to just leave, to take what he wanted and to just leave. He didn’t move for a really long time. It felt like forever. He just stared at me as I cried and begged. Finally, he let out the most disturbing thing I will probably ever hear, “Put down the gee-tar, sweetheart.” I had just about lost it, I honestly thought I was going to faint, vomit, die, something. I knew deep down that I couldn’t move if I even wanted to. What happened next is probably the most unbelievable part of this story, but it’s honestly the only way I was able to eventually make light of the situation, and to tell the story the way I am now able to. Right after he told me to put down the “gee-tar”, he farted. Shit you not, a long, loud and otherwise impressive fart. I remember he kind of looked uncomfortable at what he had just done, but he then decided to take a step forward. All my adrenaline rushed at once and I saw him coming at me and all I could think to do was run. He realized I was going to bolt and he lunged for me and as he did, I lept up onto my bed and dashed over the other side and right out my bedroom door. It was almost too fucking easy. I don’t remember how I got down the stairs, but I got down them quickly enough. It was all a blur after that. The front door had a deadbolt but the door to our garage does not, and I realized that’s how he got in. I’m sure I didn’t leave it unlocked but I do occasionally do the things that stupid girls do. The garage door was still open a crack and that’s where I made my exit. I could hear him fumbling down the stairs but I don’t think he chased me through the rest of the house after that. I got out the garage door and had to run across a bunch of gravel and cut through to my nearest neighbors home. Not only did I nearly get raped by an intruder, but I also had the wonderful experience of banging on my 75 year old neighbor’s door, half-naked. I got in, he called the police, and while we were waiting for them, I heard a boat engine start up and leave. That’s right. A man came and escaped by boat to rob our house. I don’t think he expected me to be there, as there were no cars in our driveway and no lights on, and a lot of people know that several houses in our area are sort of “vacation homes”. The police came and didn’t really do much. I gave them my statement, and I left out the fart, which I honestly now regret but I was not in an amusing mood at the time. They scanned every room in the house but he was obviously long gone, out in the bay, having a laugh probably. They never found him. He didn’t actually get much from our house. He took the cash I had left on the counter, the toolbox from our garage, and oddly I think he stole my passport. I never found my passport after that day, and it had been left on the counter as well. Kind of weird to think about. Truth be told, this whole thing did really screw me up for quite sometime. Needless to say, all of our doors have deadbolts now, and my boyfriend has to come home every single night. I was ultra paranoid about every noise, every boat, every night in alone for at the entire year after that. Now I realize, hell, I got out of it. I’m okay. We have deadbolts now, I’ll probably be fine. In the end, some of what happened was really funny, and I do laugh when I look back on it most of the time. Sometimes I cry, it just depends on the situation. I wasn’t raised to be afraid of anything, (which is highly unnatural) and I realize this all sounds ridiculous, and it absolutely was. Shit was bananas.Summary:
Summarize: I'll share my story: I was sitting at a stop light just kinda zoned out because the light was red, and out of nowhere this guy just slams into the back of my car and everything inside just flew everywhere. I'm still trying to figure out what happened and I looked back and just instantly got pissed. I throw my door open and scream "WHAT THE FUCK!!" And the guy's just like "bro I'm so sorry..." And gets In his car and backs out so I get into mine and he pulls next to me saying to meet at the gestation right ahead. He's in front of me, and as I'm slowing down to turn, he just floors it and takes off. I have no idea how the hell his car is driving still, let alone hauling balls because there is so much radiator fluid and smoke just coming out of his car it's unbelievable. So he takes off, and I look at my friend in the assigner seat like "what the fuck do I do?" So I gun it, and tell him to call the cops. I'm going 90 in a 55 on the frontage road and this lady catches up to me king if that guy hit me. I say yes, and she takes off. I am at no point of catching him so I turn around tell a cop to meet me at a Walmart near for a report. We get everything done and he tells me that six people called in my accident saying everything that happened and the lady who started following him got his plate number. So I leave and the cop calls me about ten minutes later saying the guy got 20 miles away and hit a different car and fled, then gets pulled over because his car is fucked and it turns out, he's got a warrant out already and two more from that so he got arrested within an hour of it happening.Summary:
Summarize: Back in 2005 (3rd grade), this kid (let's call him John) started riding my bus. He, a couple of other people, including my future boyfriend, and I became pretty good friends throughout elementary school, into middle school, and even today in high school. John got closer to me in 2011 (6th grade) just by talking about books and video games. However, this friendship started moving off the bus and into the classroom. He would sit with me during lunch and during class, but my naive self didn't think anything of it. A year later was the first time he asked me out. My friends had been teasing me for months about him, but I insisted it was just platonic. He proved me wrong when he slipped a note in my locker telling me how pretty I was, along with a pen with a plastic parrot on top (how romantic; in his defense, the pen was a pretty hot item at the Scholastic Book Fair). In response, I wrote a note explaining while I was flattered, I wasn't interested and gave the parrot back. After this first attempt I could tell something was wrong. John was a bit moody and we distanced a little, but he came back a couple of months later and we were friends again, just not as close as before. The next year, I started dating a family friend who went to a different school. Eight months later, I broke up with him because he cheated on me. John and another friend from the bus, let's call him Andy, immediately told me he was an asshole and didn't deserve me. Two years later, 2013/sophomore year, he asked me out to go see a movie. I was completely taken by surprise and I had no idea what to say, but I didn't want him to be upset so I told him that it wasn't a good time. To be fair, I was having a lot of family problems and I really didn't want to date anyone at the time, but no matter what I didn't want to date him. I could tell he was a bit upset but that could be expected. Less than two weeks later, I started dating Andy. John was PISSED because he and Andy hated each other (ironically, they're both extremely similar). John didn't speak to me for the duration of the relationship. Andy told me that it was because John was jealous; he revealed to me that he and his friends had known John had liked me since third grade. At the end of Andy and I's relationship, John started saying that Andy was a sociopath: he was manipulative, he was dating me just to spite John, he was just trying to sleep with me. To be fair, Andy might very well be a sociopath but you can see where I might see a red flag or two. We broke up soon afterward and John made sure to be there for me, though I was clear that it definitely not a good time. This year, 2014, John's becoming more persistent. He tried making a move on my best friend (also not interested and looks EXACTLY like me). He's given me gifts. He's texting me more often, often texting again after a couple of hours wihout me replying his original text. He's offerer beating up the asshat that tried to touch me. He's asked me out 3 times in a matter of months. Each time I brush it off, never flat out saying "I don't like you, leave me alone," but I'm getting to my wits end. I don't know how he can't get the hint: he ALWAYS texts me first; I NEVER give him a straight answer as to plans; I avoid any contact that might be considered intimate; I've dated multiple guys that I haven't even mentioned here. I don't want to be an asshole, I don't want to do it over text, and I don't want him to blow up, but I'm not interested. What do I do?Summary:
Summarize: It's not absurd. It's a matter of principle. Do you think when Empire Strikes Back came out, it'd be okay to run down the streets yelling "VADER IS LUKE'S FATHER!! HAHA!"? The answer is no. As viewers that have the luxury of keeping up to date with shows/movies, we should respect other people that don't have this luxury. You can be excited all you want, but in the Prof's case, instead of posting this shit to the entire class, why not go ask, "Oh hey, have you seen last week's episode of BB? Yeah? Cool! Let's discuss our excitement!" - IMO, this is what the teacher should be doing, instead of literally, ruining the show for, potentially, many people. The feelings that we had when watching that episode were immense; they were great; they were what us humans love to feel in our lives. Do you really want to prevent another person from feeling these awesome things by spoiling shit for them? Your mentality is no better than the trolls that lurk through Reddit and post random spoilers in the most random of thread. So, to avoid you saying "but again, what's the timeframe?",Summary:
Summarize: I had been riding a high from getting so many AP mid champs and winning with them, so I wanted another. It was between Swain and LeBlanc and I was told Swain would be better so I picked him up and went through 3-4 terrible games with him. I just don't get him. Can someone help me with a build, playstyle, and/or strategy? If you could I would greatly appreciate it Sincerely, A lvl 30 noob :3Summary:
Summarize: Alabama's constitution requires the state to keep a balanced budget. A deficit is illegal. But as Bob Dylan said, everything's legal as long as you don't get caught. Interesting statement from the article. Quite poetic in regard to every photographer who didn't pay sales tax is now getting hit with it. The entire website al.com is garbage. No links to anything, completely one sided bitch fest. This site has a much more unbiased review of what is happening. Long story short Alabama has ALWAYS charged for services. A lot of photographers tried working around this by abusing "sitting fees." Sitting fees are for photographers who are worried clients wont purchase prints. But that's not how things work anymore. I haven't seen a wedding contract without digital prints on it in years. Regardless, no Alabama law excludes sitting fees from taxes. Someone went to court over this back in 2014 and lost. And it painted a big bright light on photographers and the state is now turning their attention to those who avoided taxes for shooting weddings.Summary:
Summarize: by no runes, I meant buying runes prior to 20 is the biggest waste of IP This is the worst thing "veterans" tell new players. Tier 1 runes are VERY helpful and first win for the day can pay for an entire set. I went through 10 levels before seeing someone use tier 1 runes. I bought some and was actually able to even jungle pre-30. They are a very good set to hold you over for new players. Unless it is a smurf account buying directly into that 1-5 champs and specific runes, it will take a new player a long time to get an AD and AP default set + a few champions they like (not counting a few they'll buy and turn out to not like.)Summary:
Summarize: Fuck man. It's like... Yahweh said the Jews would get their holy land back in BC. But it took until the fucking 60's before Israel. HP/Valve said we would get silencers back when we were in beta. So, who knows if we will get them tomorrow, or in nineteen hundred years.

Summarize: So, I pre-ordered on Amazon a few months ago, received a code and redeemed it yesterday and confirmed my status. I was on Amazon and noticed they are now offering the $10 credit if you pre-order. I wrote Amazon a message explaining how can I obtain the extra $10, and they told me to cancel the order I already made, and re-place the order. I did this, and they sent me ANOTHER code via email. It's been over a day and my early access is still standing with the old code. I now have this extra code I would be willing to give away to someone on Reddit if I know I wouldn't be locked out. Leave a message about your favorite Final Fantasy experience and why you should get the code. I'll post the winner at the end of the day. Thanks.Summary:

Summarize: Well, I'm so jealous. Maybe that's why. I just want two things from her. Apart from these, I accept everything that she can do. But she don't want. She always having fun with my decisions. She always like "Are we at stone age or something?" The only two thing that I want? Like I said before, I'm so jealous. So much. And maybe just because the country and city that we living. There are a lot of stupid "horny" people. A lot of. You can't even imagine. None of them can hold their eyes of my girlfriend's legs. I am not joking. I am not against her wearing but these situtations causes me to. That's so bad. You know, we can't get along with her. Also, she has a lot of friends and she keeps speaking with boys that I said "Never talk with him." For example, she keep giving "Hello" to a boy that he used fault language to my girlfriend and to me before.(Words like "WHORE" :(. I can't do something to him.) Think how I feel pathetic and crushed. I said the boy "Never talk with her anymore." and she keeps salutes the boy. Not only him. There are a lot of boy friends of her. Her boyfriends are more than her girlfriends. And she is like "I'm 18 and what do you think? Don't rule me like your family." My family is so tied to their religion. But not I am. But she keep saying that. I don't know. I don't even talk with an another girl. Not even only one girl. But she keeps talking with boys. I don't care about girls. Why she needs boyfriends? And our only problems are these. Seriously there is nothing else. She always having fun with my decisions. She always having fun with me. Even she love me, I feel like she is not. But I know/I hope she love me. I am not a guy that looking for relationship constant. But this one became my best relationship ever I had. By the way this is my first relationship. But please don't tell me something like "You are so young, you have a long patch on your life." Please. Actually I am so crushed. Sometimes I go to the toilet at my school and starts to crying. I got family problems. My family's money situtation is going so bad. My father and mum always fighting these days. She is my only support, but look what she doing to me. I said, "Okay forget about the wearing short things, you can. But atleast don't talk with boys. Don't salute them. I love you so much, I can't stand." But she rejects me. What should I do? Please help me.Summary:
Summarize: It was a summer in the year 2005, small beach town on the coasdt of Southern California. I, at the time, was 19, hanging out with a couple buddies when we heard of a Volcom factory party in Costa Mesa. So we head over there. I had 3 beers before we got to the door, so I was feeling pretty buzzed (i'm a lightweight). I show the doorman my ID and he gives me a 21+ wristband. And all of my underage friends as well. So we go in and they have a full OPEN bar and in random buckets, redstripe beer and wine. So I grab some more beer and start drinking. Before I know it, I was hitting on random young ladies with my new found self confidence. One girl came up and we started talking but I thought she was into me so I grabbed her and kissed her, but as soon as I realized she wasn't kissing me back I let go and all my friends laughed and she stormed away. I wandered around asking more girls if they want to make out but none obliged, so I found myself upstairs with a bottle of cheap wine and I drank about half of it. I then meandered downstairs and by this time I was so drunk I could barely walk. I saw my friend and I said, "watch this" and kicked the wall and a huge picture fell off it. We were then escorted out, and by this time we were all drunk and it was around 2am. So stupidly my friend drove drunk. I blacked out for about 30 mins until I got woken up by my friend yelling at me to "GET THE FUCK UP AND OUT OF THE CAR!!!!!!!!!!!!" So naturally, I did. We were at a church. He told me to go kick the church van. So we both, drunk, started kicking this random church van. I remember I kicked it so hard I fell down. Then I ran over and kicked a sign. Then got back in his car and drove off.Summary:
Summarize: Did you not read the rest of my post? This is insane you obviously are a fucking uninformed ignorant fool. Some things are necessary and national defense is one of those things. The world isn't as simple as you seem to think, there are limited resources and other people will take them from you (or in this case us because we are talking about the defense of a nation). Without a collective defense program you wouldn't even be able to sit around bitching about your taxes, you would just be dead or paying taxes to a foreign government who has taken over your homeland. Take a history class and you will see that countries with resources that others want are going to have it taken from them if they don't defend themselves collectively. Unfortunately for you this means you pay for national defense even though you would rather live in some kind of anarchist society. What the fuck do you think would happen if we dismantled the US military? Hell at this point our military infrastructure alone would be reason for another country to invade, all sorts of countries and groups would literally kill for access to a nuclear missile silo. You can't have it both ways if you enjoy the protections provided by the government, which in this case you do because you live here, then you have to do your part. I feel like anybody who has a middle school education should know the realities of international war, namely that a fucking ar15 won't do jack. You might kill a couple people but they will eventually just drop a bomb on your house. And many of the things required for national defense are massively expensive, no individual can pay to develop and build a fighter jet but in a war situation they are vital, so without a government paying for it you are screwed.Summary:
Summarize: When I was five I had a severe head injury from geting hit by a truck while I was riding a moped. I had, what you have, a subdural hematoma and some other injuries. I died for two minutes in life flight helicopter before they brought me back on the 13th go with the defibrillators. I had a 10% chance to live through a surgery to relieve the pressure the blood was putting on my brain. The pre surgery cat scans showed my body had absorbed an amazing amount of the blood over night and they didn't have to do surgery. I was out of the hospital in two weeks.Summary:
Summarize: It was kind of a bittersweet meet up honestly. Definitely not anything special or at all what we had discussed, but not exactly a disaster either. I'm not sure how to tell this story so I'm just going to start... My birthday is this month and he had been discussing what he wanted to do for/to me. How he wanted to just make the day all about my pleasure, sort of like the first time we slept together. He told me he got massage oil and and had been telling me he couldn't wait to get his hands on me, to tease me, and to taste me. That he wouldn't let me have his cock until I came for him. On his lips. That plan definitely went out the window. When I walked in he wrapped his arms around me and kissed me. My lips, my ears, my neck, and I was doing the same. Before I knew it he picked me up, my legs were wrapped around him, and he carried me to the desk. My dress was up around my hips and I could feel how hard he was through my thin tights. He pulled each of my legs up to his chest, running his hands the entire length, to remove my shoes as I laid back. I thought he was going to take me right there but we made it to the bed. We barely made it to the bed. He was pulling my tights off and on top of me in seconds. He left my panties on to tease me, letting me feel his hard cock against me. I reached down an pushed my panties aside and with one firm thrust I had all of him. That first moment always feels amazing. I feel so full, so tight around him. He fucked me like that, half of our clothes still on, moaning into my ear and neck, until he came. We relaxed still wrapped up in each other before finally stripping off the rest of our sweaty clothes and having a drink. We had somehow knocked the box of chocolates off the bed and wasted half of them. He laughed about how I ruined his plan and I told him there was still time. As we were talking and laughing and grazing what was left of the candy we we ended up discussing his wife and how jealous she is of one of their single neighbors and an invasion of his privacy that she did recently. I didn't know what to say and half hoped he wasn't making it up because of our communication talk recently (which we came to an agreement on anyway) and half hoped he was because it was a little crazy. Despite that awkward moment he soon had his hands on me again. I was the little spoon and he was caressing my body. Running his fingertips down my side, over my ass, gently kissing the back of my neck and nibbling my shoulder, until his fingers found their way between my thighs. He growled into my ear, mmm, as he does, "you're so wet for me" and I moved my ass against him so he could get inside me. I responded with a soft moan and told him I wanted him. He kept massaging my clit with his figers, his other hand across my chest holding me close, as he slowly but firmly pushed himself into me over and over, sending little waves of pleasure throughout my body. I could hear his breath quicken, even over my own noises, feel it against my neck. I was pushing back against him, my legs trembling, mumbling incoherent "yes"s between moans as he kept his pace. The perfect pace. As I started to cum he forced himself as deep as he could get and held his cock there, his fingers making just the right movements to take me over the edge, the arm over my chest held me tightly as I shook. After enjoying that for a few moments I rolled back against him, throwing a leg on each side, without losing his cock I was riding him backwards. This always makes me laugh a little because it reminds me of the "crab walk" game in elementary school. So, as I can't believe that is sexy, I sat up into reverse cowgirl. He loves looking at my ass and squeezing it and seeing me take him in. After what I believed was a good workout I hopped off and wrapped my mouth around him. I sucked all of my juices off of him. But I could only go so long wothout it and I started riding him again, leaning over to nibble his ears. The way he was grabbing me, the almost grunts I could hear, I knew he wanted it harder so I gave it to him, but before long he had me on my back again, with a pillow underneath me and my legs over his shoulders. He knows I love this, the slow deep thrusts and the way it makes his pelvis rub against my clit. It wasn't long befire my knees were buckling again and he started riding me hard, pushing my body towards the edge of the bed. By the time we finished my head and shoulders were hanging off. We didn't notice this but the clock in the room was an hour ahead so we didn't think we had much time afterward. We layed there relaxing and laughing and snuggling until he got into the shower. I watched him get dressed longingly and he came back to bed. It is always so hard for either of us to leave, and he started teasing me again. He was kissing my neck, which drives me crazy, and I alid his hand between my legs to show him exactly how crazy. Once he felt how badly I wanted him he started using thise fingers. Moaning and writhing he asked "can I make you cum like this?". I had to be honest. The answer was no. No one can, I barely can make it work myself. So he left me like that! All worked up wth no release. . . . . .Summary:
Summarize: I've made the huge mistake of using a social mask almost constantly since I was a child, and now that I've realized this I feel so anxious in every single social interaction. "Am I doing right? Should I say something more apropriate? I could say that thing Robert Dawney said in Iron Man. Be more like that other guy. Pretend you think like this." and so on. Back when I was still a kid in elementary school I was pretty shy around people. I can't recall too much of it but I do remember I didn't fit in with the other kids at first and it took me some time to get friends. I was still new to being a properly social human being and I thought the best way to fit in was to make people like me, so I tried really hard to behave exactly like all the other kids. I've barely started to recognize all of this, since I had pretty much forgotten about it. I stretched my behavior to the point it would resemble something likeable. I was so scared people would talk bad of me, or that they would hate me, so I embraced that mask as desperately as I could. Of course, that didn't turn out so well. During the first years I would just try to say a few bad words or lie about stuff I wasn't interested in. As I grew up, that escalated to pretty much faking every single action I did. People noticed pretty quickly that I did things abnormaly and that harmed a lot of the friendships I had. Or so I think -I can't explain this too well, it could very well be that I'm just exaggerating-. That doesn't mean I didn't do things I liked, of course, but I kept almost all of that to myself in the safety of my bedroom. Whenever I was in a scary social environment, I would just put that mask and roll with it. I've managed to discover some hobbies and things I liked, but as I started to behave more like I thought I really was, my interactions became more awkward and now I can't really talk properly to anyone without trying to refrain myself and think of something genuine at the same time. Whenever the most mininum silence appears, this anxiety skyrockets inside of me and I start to blurt every single thing I can think of. I feel like I'm being tested and that every single mistake would make people hate me. Talking to people just makes me awfully self-conscious. I don't know how to speak my mind, because I've replaced that with an extremely sensitive instinct of self-defense. My behavior is just one big convoluted mess. I'm sorry for the long post. I feel like this should express a clear message, but that couldn't be any harder. Even now my hearbeat is increasing thinking of all the things people would comment and I've probably deleted like 15 lines of text I wrote before.Summary:
Summarize: They have been pulling some tight strings to make certain evolutions work. It isn't even explained as to how Lava got her new wings, and it feels like it was implied that she was done for when Phee went crazy on her and she ended up giving her wings to Vargas. I mean, sure, Phee's lore mentions her wanting to fight Lava again and lets her live, but then comes the whole Lava giving up her wings no 7 star for uuuuuuuuu. Alim went like "DERP NOPE, NEW WINGS, OUTTA NOWHERE". Which I am TOTALLY grateful for. And Kuda is probably be one of the seven stars due to a few things. First his own lore conflicts with Atro's lore. On Atro's side, he was a dark assasin that was apparently on God's side, on Kuda's lore, he was a seen a spy infiltrating the God's army. Then he proceeds to make excuses as to avoid fighting a weakened Atro. How she didn't notice this at all, that he was lucky enough to never be attacked by the very assassin hunting her around when Urias left him, baffles me. But what I think sets the nail in the coffin is that his own lore isn't conclusive. This literally leaves the door open to let Alim do whatever they want. Death no longer seems to be a stopping point, just whenever Alim decides to end their stories. So far, I think the "Door" is the stopping point. Or... whatever they feel like is the stopping point. I was almost certain Emilia would get a 7 star before anyone else on that batch since Eze was with her and she clearly survives. I mean... Luther apparently one shots douglas. Phee rolfstomps Lava. Will... will probably get a 7 star. Don't think he is mentioned anywhere to have even suffered a wound. Alice apparently dies on her 5 star form, and then someone revived her at her 6 star form. This was way before Elza came out. This makes me wonder if the one Elza revived was Alice on her 5 star form. Now for Uda. This is an interesting one. In Uda's lore, he goes for the Captain, but saw someone else strike Mega right in front of him and Uda notices that it was a setup from the Gods to strike Mega, and is then left to fight a Female Pirate (Stya). Now, Mega, on his 6 lore, is mentioned to have suffered a fatal wound from an suprise attacks from the gods, but the Sea Spirits came back and saved him and he earned the trust of Pirates. Pirates. Stya. Pirates. Which he was trying to regain their trust. And Uda's Lore a pirate, Stya, goes apeshit on Uda 'cuz of what happens to Mega. This... might imply he gets a 7 , but he clearly survived at 6 stars on his own lore despise having fallen in another units lore. Which... makes me feel like Kuda might get a 7 too. Another thing is that their lore seems to be done way ahead of time. Everything that happens on Mega's 6 star lore fits with units that were realeased, way, WAY later. He appears on Stya's 6 star lore giving her a kiss like "Death? PSHAAAAWWWW"! Not to mention his reason for survival literally came outta nowhere. It's as if Kuda's 7 star lore could start with him being quickly taken somewhere after suffering a mortal wound. Or something. Meh, I am in the middle, that "taking his life" line buggers me so much if it is the end of what seems to be one of the most interesting characters in the game. Will admit, Struck down (Uda's Lore when Mega gets owned) doesn't sound as bad as "taking his life" (Atro's Lore when Kuda gets... penetrated). But yeah. This is my take on it. Edit : Holy shit, I wrote too much.Summary:

Summarize: I posted this in another subreddit earlier, and I got some good advice. However, it always pays to get more information, so I figured I would expand on the number of people I asked. Here goes. Alright folks, like the title says, I've come looking for some advice. I've browsed this subreddit for a few months, even made a few posts (on my main account). This is gonna be a long post, so bare with me for a bit. I recently met a girl (we're both in our early 20's) through the r/R4R subreddit. By "met", I mean we messaged a few times, then transitioned to other forms of communication (skype, kik, facebook, text, etc.). Here's a little about us. Her: She's pretty awesome. She's got a wicked sense of humour, and a sharp tongue to match. She's had some rough patches in the past, but I think she's overcome them and become a better person for it. She's also really pretty. If you want a shitty reference, I'd say she's at least a 9/10. Please don't slam the number system, I'm only using it so that people have some general idea of how attractive she is. Me: I'm the kind of guy who loves joking around. I've got a pretty good sense of humour, basically. I've not had a particularly bad past, and I'm really a pretty relaxed guy. You could pull my pants down and expose me to a group of 50 girls and I wouldn't even be mad. I can say this because it's happened. I'm also the kind of guy who is aware of what can happen, is prepared for the worst, but hoping for the best. I'm not exactly the most handsome man in the world, but I don't exactly think I'm ugly. If you want an idea of what I look like, google Sean Lock and imagine what a younger version of him might look like. Now, we've only been talking for a short period of time. She recently said she wants to come down and visit. She lives across the country in a different state. Naturally, I have some concerns regarding this, because as I said earlier in the post, "I'm ... the kind of guy who is aware of what can happen, is prepared for the worst, but hoping for the best." Here are my concerns: Trust: We haven't talked for very long, like I said. So wanting to cross the country to visit so soon is a pretty significant level of trust no matter how you look at it. Cost: Holy hell, this would cost a fair bit of money. Seems almost crazy to spend that on someone you've only talked to for a short period of time. Match: I'll be blunt. She is way more attractive than me. If we were compared solely on looks, there's no way in hell I would deserve a girl like her (in my mind anyway). Perhaps she does find me attractive, or she just really likes who I am as a person, I'm not entirely sure yet. I'm really good at looking at things objectively, but I also recognize that I stand at a biased point of view so I would like some advice. I think I would really enjoy being in a relationship with this girl. I know there is no guarantee anything will happen, and I know there are other things to be concerned about (such as cheating), because I still don't know her all that well. I also know that communication with her is crucial, so rest assured, I will be doing so. What I ultimately want is a win/win, everybody is happy. How that happens doesn't really matter in the end, be it relationship, no relationship, visit, no visit. If that makes any sense. I know I won't be taking advantage of her, but I also don't want to be the fool who get's taken advantage of. Now this all culminates into a few major question: Should I continue and try to make it work, or should I put a stop to it before it gets out of hand? How should I go about breaching these topics? Are there any other things I should ask/talk about?Summary:
Summarize: Not having such a narrow view of how things work may help you (maybe not you specifically) be a better player and not require changes to suit that narrow style. The one thing consistent in Elder Scrolls, since Arena (ignoring Redguard) has always been, versatility beats narrow. It's one of the few things ESO did right. > Rogue is a classic RPG character that wears leather armour and focuses on stealth & dexterity, dealing high single target damage to enemies from stealth and all kinds of tricks, such as restealthing/vanishing, different stuns, incapacitates, blinding powder etc. In other RPGs. This isn't a typical RPG, this is Elder Scrolls. There are no classes (outside of ESO and Arena) in this world. A "Thief" is just someone who picks locks, a "Warrior" is just a guy with a weapon. There are no classes, only roles. Your role is whatever you are doing at this exact moment. > The reality in ESO is, that you cannot play a character similar to what is described above. Yes, you can. People do it all the time. They aren't good at it because they cannot switch roles into something else when the time calls, and thus get crushed. They fail to get the quick kill before their opponent gets up they become completely unable to fight back against them, as they've used all their resources. > Restealthing or vanishing in combat is not possible for anyone but Nightblades via Shadow Cloak, Not true, there are two ways. Potions and Line of Sight. Duck behind a tree, stealth up and you're good to go. This doesn't work near keeps but they were designed to 'protect' their area thus preventing stealth. In the open world this works beautifully. Potions also give you invis, not every person in the game carries detection potions and if they do they rarely have them 100% at the ready. Pop invis, go stealth and most times you're fine. If anything this shouldn't be possible. > Sneak attack damage on live is the closest resemblance we have to the classic rogue/assassin gameplay Because 1 shots are fun for everyone involved... There is no reason I should be able to top 3700 damage from a single stealth shot. (Not including Heavy attack cancelling, thats one single hit) This isn't balance, this is dumb and needs to be fixed. Just so happens not many people know how to do it, so it's kept in check. You also lose any ability to actually fight, so its a gimmick at best. > Due to lack of reliable crowd control (as they can all be broken) Not everything is strictly CC. There are other ways to mitigate damage besides CC. > ... that they do not match the dmg shield spam or healing. Shield Damage (Blazing Shield/Frag Shield) can both be mitigated by moving away. I haven't been killed or heavily damaged by a damage shield in a LONG time by learning to move away. > The burst damage seems to be going away, which is the only aspect of rogue/assassin gameplay we currently have. It isn't going away, it's just being toned down to not 1 shot people anymore. Plus it's not even the damage that's dangerous from stealth, its the stun that happens. Focusing only on your damage numbers is a great way to miss everything else that happens in a fight. Hell it's one of the reasons I recently killed myself to razor armor, I didn't watch, I was just focused on dealing damage. It got me killed, and a good lesson to pay attention. Lets take Rock Paper Scissors. You REALLY FUCKING LOVE Rock. Rock always wins, so you always play rock. Fuck Paper, they cheat. Rock beats Scissors, but loses to Paper. For weeks you're beating the crap out of Scissors, then one day you meet up with Paper and they smother you. You get pissed, res and go after them again. Again they smother you. So instead of picking up some Scissor skills and cutting the paper, you keep smashing your head into paper and they keep on suffocating you. Every 'good' build in existence (that people who complain about these types of things generally hate because they want to make their 'own' build ignoring all other information), especially dueling builds are all built around one thing: Be able to do everything. Don't give yourself a weakness on purpose if you can avoid it, doing so will only end in Paper smothering you. Take this to heart and change your style to match the mechanics, then things like stealth damage being reduced won't even phase you.Summary:
Summarize: Throwaway account for reasons. My girlfriend [26F] and I [28M] have been together for nearly 2 years now. She moved in to my house with me about six months ago. Things are great 90% of the time and we avoid a lot of the issues that tend to plague long term couples. We spend the majority of our free time together and really enjoy each other's company. But that 10% can completely derail things and it's becoming routine. There's one huge issue that keeps popping up on a nearly monthly basis: she'll find something about my behavior that she doesn't like then focus on it like a laser beam and use it as an excuse to have a huge argument, which results in multi-day animosity between the two of us. It's totally out of the blue every time. I never even remotely see it coming. When we first started dating she had legitimate points. I'm a young guy and haven't ever been much of a relationship person so I basically just did whatever I felt like doing at the time (just FYI, this did NOT involve flirting with other women or side flings). I vehemently stuck to the "be my own man" mentality for quite a while. This faded as our relationship went on and we became what felt like true partners instead of just two people dating. The monthly freakouts, however, did not let up. They became less about actual issues in our relationship and more about totally arbitrary things that haven't even occurred. She just suddenly picks out something that I did or said and uses it as a launching point to talk about how terrible our relationship is and what an obnoxious, embarrassing person I am. It's my fault every single time, even if nothing actually occurred. It's as if her criteria for me being a 'good boyfriend' suddenly changes in her mind for a few days. She's admitted to over-thinking things on more than one occasion but it's really getting to be a problem. A few examples: One time we watched a movie and she REALLY stretched to find parallels between the movie's toxic relationship and ours, which turned into her breaking down about the myriad of ways that our relationship could go badly in the future. Whenever I have a rough day at work and need to vent a little, she assumes that I'm exaggerating and my work problems are totally my fault. I have a family history of depression and handle it with medication, but when a bad episode kicked in and I became withdrawn she just told me I need to get better control of my emotions. I had a few beers with her parents (they offered) when we visited over Christmas and she completely flipped out when we got home because she thought I was trying to mentally escape with alcohol and how disgusted she was with my behavior. We nearly broke up over it. I wasn't drunk at any point and genuinely had no idea what she was talking about. She's been stressed out at work recently. When she got home, we cooked dinner together, took our dogs for a walk, then traded massages. By most accounts a solid evening. Then she told me this: "I make it too easy for you. I always have since we started dating. You should really have to work harder for it." 'It' referring to sex. It absolutely infuriated me that she suddenly decided that sex is some sort of currency I need to earn instead of two people who love each other enjoying their bodies and strengthening their bond. Naturally, we did not have sex. The thing that made this statement so unexpected to me is that she has a higher sex drive than I do so it's not like I'm constantly 'hounding her for poontang.' I truly do love her and fully intended on proposing later this year. We spend quite a bit of time talking about our future plans, kids, etc. and are on the same page for just about everything. We're very open with each other. I'm an admittedly sensitive person and some of the stuff she says bothers me more than it should. There's two sides to every story and I feel like I'm making her sound like a lunatic, and these random freakouts are only a tiny part of our time together. But they are genuinely so soul-crushingly frustrating that I'm questioning even continuing things with her. I no longer feel like I can enjoy the good times we have together because in the back of my mind I just KNOW she's going to flip out on me with no warning in the next month and there's nothing I can do about it. The arguments always end in the same way: I console her, tell her I'm trying my best, assure her that all relationships have rough spots, we say we love each other and want to stay together, then things gradually go back to normal over the next couple days. Frankly I'm getting sick of feeling like I'm the only person that needs to change to keep the relationship together. The next time it happens and she says she has doubts about our relationship over some arbitrary problem that hasn't even occurred, I might end up agreeing with her. I thought they were growing pains from a maturing relationship but I don't see them stopping any time in the future. Does anyone else have experience in a relationship like this? I have genuinely never seen her treat anyone else like she treats me in the outbursts. No matter who she has issues with, she tries to look at it objectively and always shoulders some of the blame. Other people don't see it when she gets super mad at me - they only see her how she is 90% of the time. I alone get her bad 10% - because of this I have no frame of reference so I can't really say how much I'm actually at fault. I really do want things between us to work out, but I can't handle this forever. If it doesn't lighten up in the future then I don't see her as someone I can spend the rest of my life with. I need a partner, not someone that will use any excuse to treat me like a verbal punching bag every time they get stressed out. A relationship isn't exactly healthy when one person is constantly blaming the other for everything. And before the obligatory "SHE'S ON HER PERIOD" response, the explosive arguments do not sync up with that.Summary:
Summarize: Within the halls of Konstatinyye a deal was struck. 1000 slaves were to be given to Ragusa in exchange for an increase in tribute. To be exact, 125k ducats for 1000 slaves. Yet, these slaves were happy upon the ships bound for Ragusa. Their irons were struck and clothes replaced (if worn). A joyous celebration was had. The cry of Libertas, Libertas filled the air. Along the harbor people gathered as the ships left. Slaves looked onward, the possibility of a future ahead within their grasp. Freedom for slaves was always a possibility within Islam, but the prospect of a recurring exchange was pleasant. Duke Dzoric of Ragusa frowned at the Mamluk Delegation. Frustration was to be expected, after all Ragusa was a rival of Venice; and by extension the Mamluks. He had hoped their mutual desire for Cyprus would force the issue toward Ragusan benefit, Cyprus was always an eye for Egypt, for her isles offered naval bases and striking power toward Anatolia; now the Turkish demense. There were many in Ragusa who questioned their status toward the Ottomans. They desired freedom, which is only natural. However the Sultan had always been generous toward the fledgling republic. Besides annual tribute, not much was desired. Ragusa could enter into foreign agreements and had the defensive power of the Sublime Porte if attacked. She could sail along the banner of the Ottomans and not fear barbary piracy. Now that he thought of it, they would have been a better group to ask. Their slaves would mostly have been Italian, and fit right at home in Ragusa. "You shall not have our slaves", spoke the Mamluk delegation. "You presume to land here, not only bearing the Ottoman standard, but also seeking to harm the Amir of the Venetian Isles, our ally of several months and the only ruler in of the northern continent with any righteousness? It appears that you Ragusans are as brave as you are foolish. Begone, fiends, and be grateful that you are allowed to leave with your heads. We shall not be so merciful in the future!" This was obviously going nowhere, so the delegation returned to their ships. Upon the docks a Galley stood, her flag whipping in the Wind. "So Long, Alexandria", said Duke Dzoric. He longed to return to his city and speak a language more comfortable to his ears. The Mamluks watched and waited. Just a couple, all armed. "Set sail", screamed Dzoric when a small child began running toward the boat. Her owner screamed after he, ordering her to return. She boarded the ship and clung to the Duke. The Mamluks drew their weapons. "Return the girl!" they bellowed in their tongue, the armaments sharp and glistening in the Alexandrian sun. The girl looked at the Duke, her eyes a pale brown. There were marks along her body, she had been beaten badly. He smiled. "This boat is Ragusan territory, and any slave who sets foot upon our soil is free. The girl stays with us." Her owner cursed, the Mamluks approached and the Ragusan sailors drew swords. An impasse appeared likely, and the scene began to attract attention. "It is coin you desire, eh merchant?" taunted the slave-owner. "I have enough for the likes of you. Italians and Greeks. I know your type." He gestured with his purse. The sailors laughed. They all knew the words. From the Duke, "Liberty is not sold for all the gold in the world." They set from there, back to the home city of Dubrovnik. At least they got something out of this. The Duke looked at the girl. "Libertas", he said. She said nothing, unknowing, but she would soon come to know its meaning.Summary:
Summarize: I love reading advice from the ladies of TwoX, and now I'm hoping for some. Please excuse the throwaway account.) Last Friday, I had the Mirena IUS put in. Before, I had always used birth control pills AND condoms, just to be safe (I was bad about taking the pill on time). My boyfriend and I waited a week, like the doctor recommended, before having sex without a condom. It felt great, of course, but having my boyfriend ejaculate inside me weirded us both out. I feel like I'm being reckless, even though I know that Mirena is very effective. Ladies of TwoX, have any of you had similar experiences? Any advice for dealing with this psychologically?Summary:
Summarize: O stary... U mnie w pracy standardowym radiem jest Trójka. Ostatnio w poniedziałek rano grzebałem coś przy radiu i jak się później okazało przez pomyłkę ustawiłem 87,8 zamiast 98,8. Leciały akurat motyw z Fraglesów, to tylko się uśmiechnąłem, że znowu jakieś żarciki ze strony trójkowej redakcji. Potem przy piosence o jabłkach i gruszkach zacząłem się zastanawiać, czy to czasem nie Dzień Dziecka. Ale jak popłynęli z motywem z jakiegoś słuchowiska, które pamiętam z jeszcze z winyli, to stało się jasne, że coś jest nie tak. Albo - że jest bardzo TAK. I wiecie co? Nie wyłączyłem jeszcze przez dłuższą chwilę. Te piosenki mają w sobie coś z /r/GuiltyPleasureMusic połączonego z dawką nostalgii od której nie sposób się oderwać. Od lat grzebię nocami w necie zapuszczając się w jakieś zapomniane korytarze alternatywy, słucham jakiegoś nienazwanego projektu z 15 wyświetleniami na YT, zapomnianego zespołu z Bandcamp, wydaję majątek na płyty i koncerty, jeżdzę na te wszystkie OFFy, Open'ery itp., ale częstotliwość 87,8 rozłożyła mnie na łopatki.

Summarize: So I get to my local smoke shop to buy a new bowl piece, because the other one broke a couple days ago. I buy some cheap one since I only had about 10 bucks with me. Me feeling like I just bought my own island, I wanted to break this piece in, so I proceeded to the beach. Now I get out of the car reaching with my busted wrist into my pocket dropping the fucker right in front of my eyes. After the accident, I went back into my car and sat there in shock, realizing I don't have any more money for a new piece. I was literally seconds away from smoking, now I took the second obvious choice and decided to masturbate until I felt good to drive again.Summary:
Summarize: I know this from personal experience, it is difficult but not impossible. My ex-so had pulled the same thing on me. I did not take it quite as well as you did and I got quite mad at her. It was not until these past weeks that my kid sister, who had loved my ex got back in contact with her that we started talking again. It was awkward and it still is but we are now getting used to the idea of seeing each other as mostly friends and it gets easier by the minute. However, the first months were a bitch and things went down hill fast. There was arguing and cursing out and we both said things we regret. I still cannot trust her but I am getting more used to the idea. It was her initial desire to be just friends and I am the one who caused the difficulties. I think op has a much better situation than I did and he will probably be better off than me seeing how it has already working towards the goal of becoming friends. Good luck mateSummary:
Summarize: As an ex Muslim I would like to jump on this. I'd like to answer this as to why some are peaceful are some aren't. It depends where these Muslims were raised. Quran is the only book in the world interpreted in million different ways by different people. There are Muslim women who cover their whole body and face with the Niqab, women who cover their hair only, those who cover half the hair, don't cover at all but wear appropriate, don't cover and wear bikinis when they want, and they all believe in the same book. Isn't that crazy? How open to interpretation can a book be? Then there are those who read it and kill people who don't believe in their Allah, those who say no just kill the atheists and leave the rest be, those who say just Jews, those who say kill Shiites or whatever, those who say kill no one and live in peace and and and. And they all think they're the ones who interpreted it correctly. Fortunately, majority of Muslims are the one who fall in the last category and don't encourage killing in the name of God. But are they the ones who interpreted it correctly? I think of it differently. I just think people do what they want, based on how they were raised, where they were raised, whom they were raised with and how they learned from society and their personal interest, and then say "This is how 'I' interpreted it." Majority of them haven't even read it. But they still use that sentence and say "I interpret this way." You see the concept of God and Islam being the religion is stuck to their head and there can't be any other option so they have to say that. They're too scared to say they don't believe in it as well. I grew up around Muslims and when I was curious and asked about God and wanted logical answers, they always told me not to even THINK about this stuff or God will send you to hell. So with this mindset not many of them can choose not to be a muslim. Anyway, back to my point. Majority of Muslims are peaceful because in their heart they know they should not kill, terrorize and all that shit. In more modern thinking countries like Turkey and Iran majority of people believe in equal rights for men and women because in their heart they know it's the right thing and they should do it. Many don't cover from head to toe because in their heart they know freedom is the basic right of humans. It's nothing, and I repeat, NOTHING that Islam says. It's just basic human knowledge. Live your life the way you want. But the fear of "not following it will make you end up in hell" makes everyone say that it's "open to interpretation and I interpreted this way." But then there are some who don't really care about any of this humanity and take every single word of the book literally. And then there are groups like IS and extremists found. For example most Muslims might read this passage from Quran and walk away from it. >And kill them wherever you find them, and turn them out from where they have turned you out. And Al-Fitnah is worse than killing They say they interpret it if it's for self defense or whatever, but then the extremists interpret it as it is written and kill in the name of Allah. Problem is, number of people who are reading it and taking it literally and practicing it in 21st century is growing and that is worrying.Summary:

Summarize: Names are obviously changed and the dialog is probably not 100% accurate, but it's close to what really was said. Me and my friend “John” were notorious around college for being the so-called “DP Team.” We would pick up chicks at parties, enticing them about our sessions that would fulfill girl's darkest fantasies. It was easier than you think to get girls in bed, at least at the college we went to. Maybe it was alcohol, too... But, I think that many girls have that fantasy about being sandwiched between two men, treating her like a ragdoll to the point where she didn't really have to do any work. Nothing like being the center of attention. Anyway, one of the most memorable encounters was with the younger sister of a friend's girlfriend. This girl, let's call her Belle, I guess had heard about us while talking to her sister about college. Belle was a high school senior who had just turned 18, trying to make up her mind on where to go for school. It was the month before classes started up for the fall semester. John had just come back from vacation in Europe, while I had stayed in town to work full time during the summer. Now, me and John aren't bi or anything, but we're good buddies and his homecoming was a good enough occasion to throw a BBQ. So, Friday, we organize a nice little party at a mutual friend's house and invited a few people over. I guess our friend's girlfriend wanted to show Belle what a college party is like, because guess who came over that night? Now, I should tell you that Belle looks a little like the pornstar Ariel Rebel. She's no more than 5'1'' tall, with medium length dark black hair and a pale white face. She was wearing a black tank top and jean short shorts, so she was not necessarily a looker, but more of a regular girl on a laidback day. We offer her some beer but she refuses, which is great because I don't really like providing alcohol to minors like freshmen and sophomores, even though everyone did it. The party goes on for awhile and I notice that Belle is sitting alone on a couch. I decide to talk to her a bit, just to see if she's having a good time. “Kristina tells me you are thinking of going to school here. What do you think so far?” I ask her. “It's a cool place!” she says, perking up immediately that someone is talking to her. From there, we talk a little bit about the school and some of the fun stuff that goes down in town. Then, out of the blue, Belle asks me about my reputation. “Soooo, I heard a little something about you and a friend of yours,” Belle says. Taken a little by surprise, I gulp and say “Haha, what did you hear?” “You two are supposedly known as the DP Team,” Belle says, her eyes trained on me as she smiles devilishly. “Hah! Who'd you hear that from?” I ask. “My sister. She brought it up jokingly one time while talking about her friends, but it honestly stuck in my mind,” Belle says. “Now, why would that stick in your mind?” I ask, now trying to nudge the conversation a bit to see if she is interested in our “services.” “Well, you know...” she says as she moves over a little closer to me. At this point, I can tell she's very interested. So I tell Belle to meet me upstairs at the bedroom with some stickers from the college radio station on it. She smiles and sneaks off, giving me a nice look at her cute little ass. I text John, telling him to meet me immediately for a situation we're having. He comes out of the garage where he had been smoking. I fill him in on the details, telling him about Belle and how she's totally DTF. “Isn't that Kristina's sister?” he says, sounding a little surprised. “Hell yeah!” I say. We then make a plan. We agree to storm the room and just fuck her brains out. If she is that forward to confront us about our situation, she no doubt is kind of a freak, we reason. So, next thing I know we walk upstairs, my heart pounding like fucking crazy. “Are we really going to double team this teenager?” I think to myself. Soon we barge through to door and find Belle sitting on the edge of the bed. She is a bit startled, so we take a few seconds, looking at each other. No words are said, and after a few glances and another cute, devilish smile from Belle, I slam the door behind me and we charge forward. John grabs Belle from behind and immediately starts feeling her entire body as he kisses her neck. I take Belle's hands and force them on my crotch as I forcibly start making out with her. We're both about 5'11'', so Belle was completely enveloped between us. Belle starts writhing in beautiful agony as John shoves his hands down her pants and violently rubs her pussy. She dry humps John as her hands continue to rub my cock that's now ready to burst through my pants. I soon take off her top and bra, revealing a pair of C cup breasts that perfectly compliment her petite yet plump body. John soon has her pants and panties off, leaving this 18-year-old completely naked in front of us. Belle pushes away from us and sits down on the bed, saying “Now why am I the only one without clothes on?” Me and John then take off our clothes, our boners at full attention in front of this young specimen. “Suck our cocks,” I command. Belle then grabs our dicks and starts jacking them. She takes turns putting them in her mouth, but me and John can tell that she probably hasn't sucked a lot of cock before. “Lick it like a popsicle, only lips and tongue. No teeth,” John says sternly. Belle, who was busy sucking my cock, takes John's advice and really starts working my cock. Each bob up and down she goes a little deeper, taking in a little more of my cock into her pretty little mouth. I glance over and see she is still jacking John's cock nicely. Obviously she's given handjobs before. “What about me baby?” John asks. Belle, who had now taken almost all of my 8 inch cock in her mouth, gave my cock one last suck that ended with a large “pop” as she moved over to John's equally sized cock. She continued to hold onto my cock, but as soon as Belle latched onto John's member, he grabbed her by the head and started to facefuck her. At this point I still can't believe that the scene unfolding before me is like something out of a porn movie. Here I am, getting a blowjob from an 18-year-old not even out of high school. John continues to fuck her face hard, but I can tell Belle is getting a little overwhelmed. John soon stops and I move in, drop to my knees and start licking her pussy like crazy. She obviously never had her pussy licked before, as she is a little squeamish and doesn't seem to like it at first. But, as I continue my ABC's and my tongue enters deeper and deeper into my sex, her moans let me know that she is liking every second of it. John had gone to the drawer to get condoms and some lube. Belle sees this and immediately says, “No need, I'm on the pill.” I stop licking her, get up and say “Well then, let's get right to this” as I quickly shove my cock into her insanely wet pussy. Belle screams out a bit, but in beautiful agony. I begin pumping away at her, missionary style. Her pussy is tight, and she grips my cock even harder. I can see John in the corner of my eye, masterbating to the scene in front of him. After a good few minutes, I say “John's turn.” I pull out, and John almost immediately takes my place. John only fucks her missionary for a minute. He then turns her over, tells her to get on all fours, and enters Belle's pussy from behind. As he's fucking her doggy style, I get up on the bed and tell her “Taste your pussy on my cock” as I set up shop in front of her. Belle then starts sucking, although with the pounding she is taking from behind, she doesn't take my cock as deeply in her mouth as before. After another few minutes, me and John switch positions again as I take her from behind and he tells her to suck. However, again he starts fucking her face hard. As I pound her pussy, he pounds her face, making her gag a little bit. He pulls out of her mouth, but she grabs his cock and immediately puts it back in. She's becoming a good little cock slut. About 5 minutes pass in this position. Obviously she is just loving it, but me and John look at each other knowingly and I say, “It's time to find out why we are known as the DP Team.” Me and John pull out and John gets the lube. “What position do I get in?” Belle asks as she catches her breath. “Just lay right there,” John says. “Have you ever been fucked in the ass before?” I ask. “No, but I'm so ready to try,” Belle says. John lubes up his cock, gets back on the bed, lays right next to Belle and slowly starts to enter her ass. Much to my surprise, Belle doesn't even flinch. She must have been so horny that we could have done basically anything to her at that point. John slowly starts to pump her in the ass. Belle lets out this moan that is half yearning and half scream. He pumps her slowly, like at one eight the speed with which he fucked her face. I gauge the situation closely. Every time we do this, once we get to this point, I only join in if she just looks completely into it. Belle was absolutely completely into it. So I tell John to flip her over so that he's on the bottom and she's on top. John eagerly flips her over. He stops pumping her so I can mount her. I jump on the bed and Belle looks at me with one of the most “come hither” eyes I've ever seen. I immediately shove my cock in her pussy and me and John just start fucking Belle hard. Belle looked to be in complete ecstasy. Her head was rolling around, eyes closed, as she screamed out in pleasure. I was so glad that the music downstairs was pretty loud, because the last thing I would want is for her sister Kristina to hear this little session. This position lasted a good 15 minutes. Me and John just kept going in and out of her. Me and John switched sides at least three times, each getting a few turns to fuck her ass. Soon, me and John were ready. We pulled out of her and told her to get on the floor and on her knees. Belle happily obliged and was soon looking up at us as we jacked our cocks. “Where do you want us to cum baby?” John asks. “All over my fucking face. That's what you guys like, right?” Belle says. “Give us a little bit of help,” I say. Belle knew exactly what this meant and again started taking turns sucking our cocks. “Do you taste your ass?” John says. Belle nods as she sucks his cock. It only took like a minute before we both exploded. I came in her mouth as my cock was about halfway in. Belle gaged a bit and spit some out, but it dribbled out of her mouth and onto her chest. John then came on her face, thick ropes of semen hitting her cheek, forehead and nose. “How does it taste baby?” John asks. “Amazing,” Belle says, trying to say it seductively. Me and John just stand there and gaze in awe of the mess we made of this little teenager. Belle goes over to her pants and gets out her phone. I shit you not, she starts taking a few selfies of her cum splattered face. This being the master bedroom of the place, I tell Belle to go and clean herself up in the shower. Me and John put back on our clothes and leave the room one by one. I later see Belle as she's leaving with her sister, who looks none the wiser. I sure hope I left Belle with an nice impression of this place.Summary:

Summarize: Recently my boyfriend and I haven't been seeing eye to eye with spending our free time together. We live together, and he has a M-F 7am-3pm outdoor job that leaves him exhausted when he gets home. I am still in school and am interning part time over the summer. During the week days, we usually don't do anything. He comes home, lays in bed and watches TV until he's ready to go to sleep. We occasionally go out to eat, but for the most part he's home for the rest of the day when he's off work, understandably. The issue arises when it comes to the weekend. I love spending time outdoors, going to the pool, and even occasionally going out. I can sleep in until 12 or so but feel the need to get up and do something pretty soon after that. He on the other hand, sleeps in until 3-5pm, and when he does get up, rarely wants to leave the house and do anything, maybe go out later that night. We live in a town that's not far from some really nice outdoor parks and trails, and I'm beginning to get frustrated that he doesn't seem interested in doing these things. It's not that he doesn't enjoy the outdoors, he just rather sleep. His idea of a compromise is going to the pool one afternoon and hoping I don't ask him to do anything else that weekend. So whats the deal? Is it reasonable that he wants to sleep in on the weekends because he works so hard during the week? How can I tell him I'm unhappy with the free time we do spend together? What are your thoughts?Summary:
Summarize: i hear what you're saying. i would love to see the end of the state, if that meant i could do everything i wanted, because for the most part, i am a responsible person, and i don't have any great desire to take other people's stuff, or make it harder for someone else to make a living just because they don't look like me. but the problem is there are people like that, and while i am not black or jewish, people who base their opinion of another person's worth on something so arbitrary could just as easily find some problem with me. that's what society is all about, a set of agreements on what is acceptable and what is not. so comparing the effects of racism by buyer vs. seller is a bit problematic- neither one is good or should be accepted, but one causes more harm than the other. it has to do with sample size. the nature of commerce means for any particular good, there will be more consumers than producers. therefore, if an individual consumer makes irrational decisions, he limits his own choices, but the harm to the producer is minimal. however, if a producer makes an irrational decision, he can cause a whole group of consumers some amount of hardship. if the market has much competition, then that harm is limited, and more than likely will steer consumers away from that producer - as long as it is public knowledge that the producer has made that decision. in the case of discrimination against minorities, it often is the case that it's not a public policy, therefore, people who are not part of that minority group may not even know, and continue to do business with that producer, limiting the negative effect it will have on the business. even if it is public policy, people who are not part of the group may dislike the policy, but since it doesn't affect them personally, may not include it in the decision making process. and then there is the case of a natural monopoly, i.e. if there is a good that is so unique, or so tied to location, that there can be only one producer, then effectively, the product is being denied to a group of people for no good reason.Summary:
Summarize: How DARE gay people not want straight people in gay spaces that they feel safe in all the time! Most gay folks are more than happy to have straight people come in as the OP of the thread said, but the nasty truth is, sometimes gay people just want to be around other gay people. It's not really a sex thing (although that's part of it) - its a culture thing. I mean, think of it this way: for the sake of example, let's say you're a member of Faith A, and you've been invited to visit your Faith B friend's house of worship. You're welcome to come as a guest, listen, observe, be polite, etc. In fact, most places will welcome you with open arms. But let's say that you start inviting more and more of your Faith A friends to this Faith B house of worship, because you enjoy it so much. At what point does it cease to be a space for Faith B people? There are no gay houses of worship, and the cultural centers are few and far between and usually only in major cities. For gay folks, gay bars serve this purpose - as a community center, as a place to be themselves in their culture, and yes, as a place to meet like-minded people. They're really vital. And having a drunk bachelorette party there to gawk at the sideshow really dehumanizes gays in their own space.Summary:
Summarize: So luckily for you all, this fuck up happened on this day and doesn't involve sexy times with anyone. Just me being a general dumbass. So me and some friends decided to get some food before our next class we all had together at 1:15 so at about 12:45-ish we all piled into each other's cars and went to the nearest Taco Bell. I fucking love those cinnabon bites you can get there now... I think they're going to kill me one day but that's besides the point. I planned on sharing these nuggets of delicious, sugary goodness with my friends and they're only available in 2, 4, or 12, so basically a sample, a snack, or diabetes as your choices, but that's besides the point. Anyways, I'm getting a dozen to let my friends have some. We're inside Taco Bell, not the drive thru, because the car line looked rather long and it's fucking cold out so we all go inside. I go up first, my order is easy, just a 12 pack of cinnabon bites. This is where I fuck up. I look right at the lady and ask for a 12 pack (Taco Bell enthusiasts may know where this is going already) without missing a beat. I'm ready to get my little personal serving of 'Merica in a plastic cup and don't really think anything when the cashier asks me 'crunchy or soft?' Now I've ordered these bites in 12's before and really should've realized that was a weird question to ask for fried dough, but no, I'm a fucking retard and say, "wow didn't know you could do that... um, how bout soft?" so she rings me up, hands me the receipt and my card (important) and it says 12 fucking dollars on there. Um, they cost 4.50? So it's at this point I realize... oh shit, I just ordered one dozen soft tacos instead. Now this isn't a big deal, just take the tacos? But nah, I want my cinnabon bites and I'm determined to have my friends experience the foodgasm these will create upon touching our tongue. So as politely as I can (I work as a concessionist as my job so I try to be polite and not a hassle like some customers can be) I explain I've really screwed up on my order and it's my fault entirely. Could you give me a refund for this, I meant the cinnabon bites but didn't make that clear enough (because I'm a goddamn moron mind you). You'd think that'd be it but nope, it can't be that simple. This IS a fuck up after all, not just a minor mishap. So the cashier looks a bit befuddled and worried at once. She tells her manager, a shorter, stockier, younger woman complete with obviously fake colored hair and a massive attitude, she needs a refund. The manager looks like she's going to jump across the counter and fucking kill me. Now without looking directly at me, because that'd of course be way too rude and direct, she starts talking VERY loudly about how inconsiderate this is and how there's people waiting (I felt bad enough for keeping my friends and the assorted strangers waiting) but really was taken aback she was making this huge a deal out of this. A refund right? Well I paid with a card. And this manager doesn't know how to refund a card payment. And as far as I could tell only one of their registers was open so I'm holding up the whole line. (opening up another one isn't that easy, again concession experience) I feel so stupid now, but at the same time, I really couldn't help but wonder how you can earn the title of manager but not perform a card refund? My place of work, all managers and even some regular cashiers can perform refunds for customers. This manager had to call someone higher up, maybe customer service, shit I don't know, to tutorial her on how to do this refund. Meanwhile she's yelling to the back, do NOT make that dozen tacos, ay throw in a dozen cinnabons, while I'm standing off to the side letting other people get their orders out of the way. I feel like a really dumb shit, my friends think this whole ordeal is priceless, and I mean I'm not socially anxious, this is pretty funny, but I still felt bad for holding up the line. I overheard an older guy wondering why this woman couldn't just do the refund and made a public point of me being a detriment to the establishment or something but after quite a few more minutes, she rings up the refund, gets me some cinnabon bites and a reciept, all while looking super duper flustered. I don't think I've ever seen a human being so pissed off over dumbassery, it was just a mistake, allbeit a really stupid one. I felt a bit selfish for not just taking the tacos really but I work minimum wage and really didn't want to spend 12$ on food I didn't want and figured a refund would be a reasonable request. At the end of the ordeal, we were two minutes late for class (after intense reckless teenage driving) but I had the bites, the cinnamon sugar sprinkled food of the gods, and I was content.Summary:
Summarize: I see that you are a glass half empty type of person. Suicide rates in Austrailia are around average. Take 2008 for example. In a population of 22 million, ([Source]( there were 2190 suicides ([Source]( By any stretch of the imagination, 2190 out of 22,000,000 is an extremely tiny number. You just need to look at the whole picture to see this. There are not so many people commiting suicide. It's a really small number. This is also not a fucking UNIVERSE OF SORROW. I personally do believe suicide is a tragedy in each and every instance, but don't try to take away from the feel-good nature of this story. Look at it this way: If this guy has saved 160 people over 10 years (lets just assume that it was 2190 per year), thats 160 out of 21,900, or 0.75% - an extremely significant number, especially considering he was doing it part-time, in one location. Don't be so quick to villify my respect for this individual or to feel good about good being done in the world simply because he isn't stopping everything. Edited to fix the links.Summary:

Summarize: In my entire life I have had only ONE pair of jeans that I can call truly comfortable to wear. They are a slim fit Tommy Hilfiger jeans and sad to say they are now fading and the knees look like they might split soon. I have to find a new pair. I have three pairs of jeans, Tommy Hilfiger, Jack & Jones Anti-Fit, and a pair of Levi's. My main problem is a few things put together. I cannot stand a skinny cut but I like the pants to be slimmer/tighter below the knees. I have big thighs and a big ass for a man unfortunately so what ends up happening is either tightness in the upper thighs, tightness in the crotch, or the pants hanging off my ass. I dress business casual and I commonly wear dress shirts or sport shirts that aren't tucked in. I can't have the pants sagging off my ass, it just doesn't make for a good look. I can never find a compromise between these three issues: High rise(sit at waist or at least above the hips somewhat), comfortable space in the groin/crotch area, Not tight around upper thighs. Now, I've always been a bargain shopper and shopped at TJ Maxx outlets and other similar outlets getting my brand name clothing for under $30 but I'm fed up and I'm ready to start buying some shit that actually fits comfortably. Is raw denim my only option? Is it even an option? Also, a major thing I should mention as well is I need the material to not be too thick, I sweat a lot and I cannot stand when my legs get hot underneath my jeans (or any pants for that matter). For the record, I seem to have a similar issue with dress pants and khakis where the pants don't sit high at my waist. Thanks for reading and I hope to get some insight into this. I'm not a fashionable guy, I got the hot girl early on in life and I never really had to worry about my looks. Now I finally make enough money to justify spending on my clothing and I'm actually at the point where I am truly fed up with my constant discomfort with my wardrobe. Thank you!Summary:
Summarize: I recently bought into Jet Blue, not only because I am a long term customer of the airline, but because i see growth potential for the company, and more importantly, the stock. Here are the reasons, and feel free to add anything you feel necessary. My background is a biology major who analyzes the stock market for fun in my ROTH IRA. So all of my stocks are bought with the idea that I will hold for at least 1-2 years, although a quick spike in a company can lead me to take my profit and run. I have only lost money in 1 stock (bought 10), and I am looking to get better at analysis. Why I bought JBLU I bought shares on 5/21, the day after the airline industry fell on the fear that lower fares would result from competition. I specifically selected JBLU because the average P/E of the airline industry hovers around 16.3, and JBLU was at 13 when I bought in. This alone showed me that there was room for upside in a company that I believe has growth potential, and therefore should be valued above 16 P/E Why this company will grow? JBLUE is expanding into the carribean and mexico. This offers increased coverage of its planes, and heading into the summer months where many people travel, an increase in flights to warm weather destinations could result in higher sales for JBLU. JBLU has also relied on the large airports to use as its base terminals, and not expand into the smaller airports. While this reduces its potential sales numbers, it both helps JBLU maintain the look of a premium airline (which can charge higher rates but still remain low-cost), and it offers it opportunity for growth in the event its current strategy is not producing the desired results. Oil: This is a two-headed dragon. Oil prices are low right now, saving airline companies billions in fuel, which has not resulted in a decrease in prices yet. Some analysts believe that this is already priced into the stocks, but an extended period of oil below $60 per barrel will save the airlines a lot more money, and that looks to be exactly where we are headed. Most recent quarter: JBLU's most recent earning were very good. They were able to decrease there expenses by 3%, with most of that coming from a decrease in fuel prices by 34%. If this continues, expect their to be even further savings in the second quarter. In addition, there was an almost 10% increase in flyers seen in the quarter, which shows that JBLU is increasing its customer base at a great rate, and it makes sense to think that it can increase its customer base even more through adding more destinations. Its revenue was also up 12.6% y/y, which helped reduce its P/E from the 16.38 that was seen before earnings, to its current level of 13, which suggests that it should be increasing in the coming months to match that P/E. Customers: The customers at JBLU are considered "loyal," which means that typically these customers are returning. I for one return as a customer because of the in flight entertainment, which is unlike any airline I have encountered. Being able to select your own TV station or radio station enhances the flying experience dramatically, resulting in an increasingly loyal user base. In one study ( JBLU ranked highest in customer satisfaction, and as the article states, "JetBlue Airways ranks highest in the low-cost carrier segment for a 10th consecutive year, with a score of 801. This also marks the 11th consecutive year JetBlue has ranked highest in the study.[2] JetBlue improves in all seven factors year over year, most notably in reservation (+29) and boarding/deplaning/baggage (+22)." This customer satisfaction means that a JBLU customer is unlikely to turn away from the airline, suggesting that the user base will continue to grow. Price targets: I rely on analysts for price targets because I do not claim to be an expert. I would love to see some input on how to calculate a good price target. I mostly use the P/E and overall company view and direction when picking a stock, and it has worked well so far. That being said, the analysts are also high on JBLU. Through my ROTH IRA, the stock analysis is rated "very bullish" with no analyst rating the stock "underperform" or "sell." One site I found had this to say: "The 12 analysts offering 12 month price targets for JetBlue Airways Corporation have a median target of 24.50, with a high estimate of 28.00 and a low estimate of 19.00." The "high" represents approximately a 40% gain, the median a 21% increase, and the low is only a 6% drop from where it closed today. These price targets are corroborated by other sites, and the consensus is a PT of approximately $25 per share. This may continue to be upgraded depending on how the ticket prices and oil price plays out over the summer months, but JBLU is primed to make a run over the summer monthsSummary:
Summarize: Sounds like chest-thumping to me. It could very well be true. On the other hand, I've lived in several shitty neighborhoods in the last decade and have never had a situation where carrying a gun would have saved me any aggravation or misfortune.

Summarize: This is my job. Exactly what I do isn’t really important….as this stat sheet shows. There is nothing that I do that couldn’t be automated. I spend days performing tasks a computer could do in less than a second. What makes me even more sad is knowing that I’ve taken programming classes and graduate level courses, coded a little project to display journal previous and next title info via a cell phone scanning a QR code. I’ve also pitched building some XSLT crosswalks for automating creating MARC records for electronic Theses and Dissertations. But making these tick marks instead of thinking or being creative is apparently what my employer wants me to do. Now, if we had employees working at this “level”, I could understand getting turned down. But the reality is that work is piling up at this midrange level because one group only wants to pose and have meetings with each other while they trap another group of people into working at trivial tasks. I guess this makes sure that the group in power never feels threatened, but the long term cost is “infrastructure rot”. Yes, I read Dilbert daily…living it is making me sick though. But at least Dilbert earn enough money that he could live on his own. If I didn’t have a spouse, I’d be at risk for living in my car. Thinking is limited to faculty only, but in reality they aren’t really given any autonomy either. Otherwise, I’d buy the stupid degree/credential so that I’d be given permission to think. (Heck, you only need a master’s degree and one with a fluff curriculum.) There’s such a profound staff vs faculty divide it can literally be measured in what I would call “pettiness events”. For instance, one would think that whoever comes in first in the morning would prop open the door as expected for the department. Nope. If a faculty member is first, they’ll unlock the door, but actually using the doorstop is a staff “job”. Furthermore, the stacks and bound journals must now be considered a closed collection because what little money we have is spent on marketing/branding the library and kissing up to wealthy patrons and “famous” local citizens via specialty collections that will see little or no use. But hey…they sound so fancy when the university mentions them in a blurb on the website! Get another job? In rural USA? Without an exact-match credential set? Buy another set of credentials and take on student loans again at 50 years old? I’m starting to wrap my brain around accepting that I’m destined to become one of the laid off. ….the surplus population. I know there’s probably hundreds of thousands (or millions) of “us” out there, just in the USA alone. We could have been real contributors to society, but there’s a strong possibility that we already are (or one day will be) mocked as leeches on the welfare state. But since that support network is crumbling….Summary:

Summarize: Hello everyone... throwaway because I don't want my boyfriend see this. I have been with him for nearly 2 years. Our relationship is good, we rarely fight, he's my best friend. The problem is he never seems to be interested in sexually pleasing me. The sex lasts like 10 minutes (IF I'M LUCKY! - usually closer to 5) and there is hardly any foreplay. He finishes and then it's like that's it. We will usually cuddle after, but there is no initiative on his part to try to help me out... I have NEVER brought it up to him that this bugs me, because I kinda feel like why the hell should I have to... shouldn't sex be about trying to please the other person, too? I can understand once in awhile being lazy about it, but every time? All my past relationships have been much, much more sexually satisfying than this one is. Oh, and one other thing, I've looked at his web history before, and he will watch porn sometimes a couple hours after we've had sex - like, while I'm out doing something (we live together) he will watch it. I was suspicious about that and that's why I invaded his privacy like that - I know, bad on me. Anyway, this issue is really my only complaint and I don't know how to talk to him about it without it feeling awkward. I feel awkward about it because I've never even brought up the fact that it bothers me and it's been two freakin' years... advice?? Thanks!!Summary:

Summarize: ok. this is not your fault, but i think i have to rant about this article. i'm gonna give the author reasons 5 (shunning manual labor jobs) and 4 (celebrating the slacker as anti-hero), but 3-1 are complete and utter crap. 3 is crap because, [across the world]( it is common to live with one's parents until marriage. So it can't possibly GenX's fault. And to generalize that the culture of infantilization comes from living at home is post hoc ergo propter hoc. Infantilization is as much a problem as parenting, economic well-being, etc., whereby someone can live at home until they are 30, yet take huge responsibility around the house - thus learning how to be a better adult - depending on what is demanded of them. 2 is crap, because once again the author fails to take numerous factors influencing the entertainment industry into account. For example, many, many, MANY entertainers were abused by their agents and record labels throughout the years. Many were left destitute. That sounds like a broken system from the get go. The music and film industries have become lazy, bloated and corrupt. [That corruption probably loses more money than piracy,]( not to mention the perpetuation of the idea that celebrities deserve a ridiculous amount of money - an amount that if a cardiovascular surgeon requested, he would be laughed at. Additionally, we were not "taught" to believe that entertainment has no value.This is false for two reasons: first, value is market determined. We do pay for things, we just hate paying for bullshit that is crammed down our throats or things that we like that are locked up with DRM. Sell us thing we want without abusive contracts attached, and the entertainment industry will move gracefully into this century. second, paying $19.88 for a CD at Coconuts in 1996 was highway robbery then, and it continues to be now. Copyright law has allowed the major publishers (versus the hardworking artists creating the entertainment) to charge monopoly rents for decades and that is a system that is falling apart, as it should. Finally, 1 is crap, crap, crap. This is just this author's commentary on the explosion of the virtual world and its appeal to everyone. It has nothing to do with GenX, the Babyboomers or anything else. It has to do with parenting plain and simple. You don't want your kid to be glued to the tube? Great, send them to dance class, gymnastics, little league, fencing lessons, whogivesafuck. The problem is that EVERYONE likes the technology and its innovations. So if mommy and daddy sit on the tubes all day, how can they expect that baby wont monkey-see-monkey-do?Summary:
Summarize: Actually, I call bullshit on this whole thing. I think you're Skeona. Remember 1 month ago when you posted in AskReddit [asking why your posts never showed up in /r/gaming]( Someone gives you the [helpful advice to get a new username and start over]( Then TADAAAA, [Skeona]( is born. In fact, you submitted 30 links to reddit in a couple of months until that point, and since then hardly anything. Also the fact that you're even posting in here only 2 hours since the original post was made, despite the fact that you claim to have very little knowledge of Reddit and 'don't check the site too often or anything'.Summary:
Summarize: These days since everything is a shouting match, you need the fringe loudmouths just to get attention to your cause. Was I personally offended at the stupid Elf emails the one dumbass at the VA sent around? No. Because I'm an adult with better things to worry about. But the VA as a whole is a broken, corrupt system that plays with good veterans' lives and well-being. And any and all attention - no matter how minute or petty it may seem at times - to any kind of unwanted behavior helps keep the issue in the public eye. Yes, lots of it is petty. So is life and daily news in general. With the general public's rampant ADHD it all blurs together into one message after a while: "The VA needs to be addressed." Like it or not (I don't any more than you do), it's the way the game has to be played these days.Summary:
Summarize: I'm incredibly sorry for your loss. I am incredibly thankful for even the smallest relationship with my father, and if he passed away so quickly, I imagine it would be that much more special to me. What made me realize how mentally unstable my mother really was happened one night during the middle of their nasty divorce: Basic story is that she and my younger sister, who has never gotten along with her, were arguing over ___ thing sister did. Mom is pissed because lack of respect, she have birth to her, etc. Within an hour my mother had her cornered, about to beat the shit out of her with the buckle end of a belt. I come in, interrupt, take the welts for my sister and get slapped across the face a few times when I confront mom about her sudden, very dramatic personality change over the past month or two. Sum-up: who the fuck are you? I don't even fucking know you anymore! Talking to a parent like that probably isn't okay, although I was full of love and betrayal as I said it, not hatred or malice. She slaps me a few times and then storms off. Comes in later to check my face and make sure she didn't leave any marks. More fucked up shit happens, drama drama, end story is that my dad came home as soon as he found out what was going on, took us into the yard to explain what happened, then took us to the police station the next day to file a report about it. I had a sizable welt and bruise from the belt buckle, but no other -physical- marks. That night I lost 16 years of brainwashed goddess-level adoration for the insane thing that is my mother. I also gained a newfound and desperately needed respect and love for my father, who I'd privately referred to as my 'sperm donor' as per my training beforehand. Salt in the wounds: the courts didn't even bother sentencing her to a mandated psychological screening , despite all of the mind-meltingly obvious shit I told them she did to herself and to me for 16 years. Fuck Arkansas court systems.Summary:
Summarize: This one happened to me last year over the summer. My girlfriend and I had broken up a few months ago, and I really needed to find another girl to help me get over the dream sex that we had. I knew this girl.. We shall call her Girl with big boobs. Now girl with big boobs had a reputation of getting around. But I had never heard any horror stories and just made the assumption that it'd be god sex. So she comes over, we smoke a little and then head inside to go watch some Netflix in my room. She puts on Brooklyn 99 and asks me if I liked that show. Yeah sure I guess. (I actually love the show I just wanted to signal that I wanted to do something other than watch fucking Netflix.) We're laying on my bed, head to toe and my hand oh her thigh with her ass pointed straight at my face. Oh god please let me have sex with girl with big boobs. Ten minutes into the episode, she turns around and says "can you do me a favor and finger me?" I was happier than a pig in shit. But I replied with "You'll like the sex a lot more than that." she giggled bit her lip and said "only if you're good" So I did what any man would do. I fingered her to the point where she was just about to orgasm and then I'd slow down or stop like my hand was hurting or some shit. As she's about to most orgasm for the like 3rd time she rolls on her back, grabs my hair and pushes my face into her vagina. ALL-FUCKIN-RIGHT BOYS WE GOT A WILD ONE! I wanted her to suck my dick, so i said to her "69" and she spun around and started sucking me off. Now I didn't think I was that good at eating girls out. But after about five minutes of me going to town she sits up in her full mount, pushes her waist down and into my face and let's out a huge moan. I almost thought something was wrong. Well there was, but not for her. My mouth FILLED with this warm weird tasting LIQUID in half a second. I panicked threw her off of me and sat up spitting the unfamiliar substance onto some clothes on the floor. Giving her a puzzled look she blushes giggles and then said "I didn't want to say anything because I thought you might think it's weird" What. The. Fuck.Summary:

Summarize: No, you're totally ready! We've all been there and we all made it out alive. You can too! When I was getting ready to graduate college, I developed a strategy that has been highly useful in so many things. I'm a big list person, so if you like lists (and crossing shit off of lists like a motherfucker) then this will work well for you. Write down the thing you want to happen. (E.G. "Rent an apartment") Take this ONE thing (don't let your other worries invade at the moment) and figure out what all needs to happen. Write down each individual task that needs to happen. It's super super important that every item on this list is an action that can be accomplished. As a bonus, make the list very specific so it keeps you on task and lets you cross lots of stuff off. If the list in step 2 is not prioritized, do that now. Rewrite the list in order of importance or the order in which things need to get done. Make a plan for doing the items on your list. Most things don't get completed in one day. Break your list into multiple days and make sure that you are always making progress. Get to work! You've totally spec-ed out your work, and now the only thing left to do is to get that shit done. I promise this method (if you apply it to your personality and lifestyle) will work. If you adjust appropriately, you can even use this methodology to answer the hard questions of life, like "what kind of job should I get," "do I really want to move that far away," "what do I do with my college degree," "should I be dating that person." I've used this method to: Quit a job Talk with people on the phone (I'm still working on not being nervous when I call people...) Apply to grad school Take exams / write massive papers Rent an apartment Buy appliances Get my utilities set up for the first time Not let my dreams get demolished after getting denied on a mortgage Buy a goddamned house (even after my loan was denied) We are so lucky to live in this era. You know why? Because there are billions of people who have gone through similar situations and have had the same questions... and we all bring our questions to the same place: the internet. If you have a question you pull up Google and ask away... I guarantee someone has had your question before.Summary:

Summarize: So, I just downloaded Fate Stay Night and have been playing it for a couple of days. I did so at the behest of many people claiming that it was superior to the animated version. This was also my first time playing a visual novel, so I figured it would be a good start. Before playing, I laid down some ground rules for myself. I was going to choose decisions that I would make if I were in the same situation. Simply put, I was going to make rational decisions and go only off of what would be presented to me in the VN. With this in mind, I start playing. The first two hours were pretty darn boring, but I didn't hold it against the game. It was mostly just a prologue where I didn't actually make any decisions. The game picked when we went to see Kirei. After listening to Kirei talk for awhile, I got, what I would call, my first meaningful choice. Fight or Quit. Keeping with the theme of making rational choices, I chose to quit. The chances of me winning the war were slim to none, and defeat meant death. It was the obvious choice. I tell Kirei my choice and break the news to Saber. I then proceed to walk home. I figured at this point the game would contrive a sequence of events that would force Shirou into the holy grail war. Just as I was thinking that, a wild Illya appears. She greets me by having Berserker . Then I get a line of text reading BAD END. Before I can even regain my composure, I'm sent to the Taiga Dojo. There I meet Fujimura-sensei and the girl who just splattered my guts across the pavement. They inform me that cowardly decisions will result in more deaths. With this, I turn off the game and go to bed.Summary:
Summarize: I've been struggling with depression since I was about 12 or so. I've never really been happy "in general" but that's not to say I can't ever get my ass out of bed. I made it to college, somehow, and after two years of alcoholism and drug abuse I had a full fledged mental breakdown. Paranoia that I can now acknowledge as irrational consumed my life, family and friends wanted me tortured and killed, I was going to be castrated, sometimes it was the infamous 'they' threatening to harm my family and friends instead. This continues to this day (I'm 25) but is relatively manageable with 1200mg Lithium and various antipsychotics(whichever don't happen to be giving me dystonic side effects at the moment). Long story short, I'm curious if there's some undiagnosed schizoaffective aspect, if there is such a thing as mild schizophrenia, if bipolar is used as a blanket term, if anyone else is experiencing "manic episodes" that, instead of being highs, are based in paranoia. I lose my insurance in about two months and I don't know if I should seek a psychiatrist that doesn't specialize in the diagnosis that has been slapped on me or if these are issues that other people deal with.Summary:

Summarize: Me and my girlfriend have been in a six month relationship, before this relationship we had basically had no sexual experience. Now six months in we both have exchanged oral and explored our sexual sides. My gf has recently showed interest in "playing rough" after a mutual friend talked to us about how much him and his girlfriend love it. We have done some things, we both really enjoy biting each others necks/ears, she loves it when I bite her breasts, and I when she digs her nails into my back. My problem lies in what to do beyond what is listed above, she really wants to try, but I'm not sure what else to do nor the intricacies of some of the more obvious ones(hair pulling).Summary:
Summarize: Posted this on another thread but it is more relevant here Last year, to celebrate the new year, my friends and I went to the beach, a friend has a house there... We have done this a couple of times, but this time was "special" because our friend turned 18... So his parents serve us a little bit of wine, they have a toast and then leave us to eat dinner... Another friend says "tonight will be just like The Hangover....lol jut kidding." Little did we know he was right... We go down to the beach, and get our drink on... Needless to say we all got super hammered. Our friend who turned 18 though was really sad, because he said he wanted to hook up with this girl and then another friend made out with her... So he was shitfaced, and making a fool of himself, so I tell him " hey lets go sit" and he got mad and grabbed a thick ass stick and threw it and it just so happenned to land on my face... Drunken me of course thought he did it all on purpose... So I let him be and storm off pissed as shit... Then, at 6 am we all decide we were going up to the house to get some rest... So we all up gather at the disco but wait... Our just recently turned 18 friend, lets call him Mike, was MIA, he was the one who was sad and angry because another friend hooked up with a girl he wanted to hook up with... Anyways, we all knew of what he was capable of doin drunk... Reckless shit... We searched for about an hour, nowhere to be found. We call his cell, someone picks up, we are all glad cause we think it is him, it is not, he had left his cell back at the house... We all seriously thought he had gone to take a swim drunk as shit in the ocean ( he did this last year, luckily we were all there and able to stop him from getting in ) and he mightt have drowned or something... About and hour later, a friend who had stayed back at the house because he had gotten sick said Mike's dad found him passed out on the balcony... His father did not make a big deal out of it... But we did not want his mother to find out because she would throw a fit... In the end, I was supposed to go back home with Mike because he lived real close to my house, ended going back with another friend to his place which was in no way close to mine, becuase his dad adviced me to becuae his mother was going to question me... Scariest moment of my life....Summary:
Summarize: Okay so my friend and I are going to go to his house this weekend to smoke. We did this 3 weeks ago and it worked fine. However this weekend another friend will be joining us so that makes 3. This is where it gets interesting, a while back, like last summer, I was at this same friend's house, we'll call him Larry, any way like 7 people were there and everyone got high except me. Fast forward the next day, my mom looks through my texts and finds out everyone got high, I get drug tested and of course pass because I didn't smoke. She eventually let me start hanging out with them again. She is 100% cool with Larry but I'm afraid that because this weekend there is more than just me and Larry she'll get hella suspicious and drug test me when I get home, (She has hella drug tests stocked up because my brother was a 'bad' kid lol) so, what should I do? I really want to smoke but my parent's trust me a lot and if they were to find out they'd be really disappointed in me, I'd lose their trust, and I'd feel really bad about myself. So I'm not sure if I'm just over reacting or not.Summary:
Summarize: I know it's wrong of me, and I feel really guilty and I'm incredibly embarrassed at myself. So, here's the story. I've been dating my boyfriend(22m) since early August of 2013. He's the most amazing guy I know, and I fully trusted him, for a while. We've had kind of a rocky relationship, and we've been a little on and off, never off for too long though. He's a bit of a relationshipophobe(excuse my lack of a better word) and the whole concept of love is a little foreign to him, and it's been kind of hard on our relationship. So, back in July of 2014, he asked for an open relationship. We fought about it for a while, and I was pretty hurt by the suggestion. I eventually talked it out with a friend and mentioned to him that I'd be willing to try it if he was willing to be patient with me. This was over text and he responded with something kind of vague and an "I love you" so I was a little confused but just set out like we were in an open relationship. I didn't have contact with other guys during this time, and my dumb insecure brain was like, "yep. he's with someone else right now" and it drove me crazy. So, one day I asked if we could talk, took a deep breath and told him that I hated this open relationship idea and he was like "well...I thought we weren't doing that" so basically I felt like an idiot, I was happy again and we moved on. So then in late August we broke up over a stupid fight, but then we both realized that we needed to kind of get our lives on the right track and maybe it would be best to not have any relationship stress to deal with or shape how we lived our lives. He assured me that I was the only one he wants, and that this wasn't a break up to see what else is out there, but just a break to get it together. Fine, I lived with that. We still saw each other a lot, we were still sleeping together, he was still my best friend. Sometime around November, we decided to get back together because neither of us liked not "officially" being together. Things have been pretty great, but something has felt so wrong to me for kind of a while. I had the opportunity to go through his phone on a few separate occasions. Like an idiot, I did it once. It started off innocently enough until I got towards the older texts. I found texts from this girl, we'll call her Jenna. So, Jenna had wished him a happy birthday, and I scrolled up a little and it all seemed okay but something felt off. So, I went all the way to the top, and it turns out they'd been talking since, you guessed it, July. It started off okay, but she'd asked if I was still around(I had an idea of moving for a little that was more a thought than anything, and it was exciting had I been single, but the idea made us both super sad...or so I thought) and there was talk of her coming over(which I vaguely remember him mentioning after the fact and it sat with me wrong but I let it go because I didn't want to make a psycho-bf scene) and she would say stuff like "I'm just trying to figure you out" and stuff, in the way high school girls used to use that line to ask a guy if he liked her. He seemed pretty faithful at first but then he got flintier as time went on and they talked about coming over and having the house to themselves and stuff. So, finally he asks her when the last time she'd been properly "fucked" was. and she said it had been a while and he asked if she wanted to(in his defense, this was right after he and I broke up...but also right after he assured me that he didn't want anyone else) and she said yes but she was hesitant about him "having" her for the first time and then disappearing or something. so stuff goes on like that for a while, then there's a text from her asking which condoms to get, and he said it didn't matter just get the biggest box there was. (I had seen this box in his room because it was a different brand than the one we used, and I tried to not make a big deal out of it, but I wanted to puke) and then from there on I basically forget the rest because I was so upset. She wished him a happy birthday in November, but I was too upset to really read the rest. So, I have a few questions for you guys. Do I even have a right to be upset about this, I mean I went through his phone, that's almost as bad. How can I move past this, since I read these texts, I've felt sick to my stomach. Should I talk to him about it? How do I even bring up that conversation without making it a fight? I think I would have been able to get over it, had it just been during the "break up" but he'd been talking to her since July...and that bothers me. I don't know what to do here. This is so not the kind of person I am and I hate myself for doing this...but what he was doing wasn't right either. Would he have been honest with me otherwise? After we got back together, we talked about it and we both said that we could have had sex, but we didn't because we wanted each other too much. But now that huge box of condoms is haunting me. I know what I did was wrong and stupid and childish and I, in some ways, deserve what I found. But I'm so scared now.Summary:
Summarize: I live in a collegetown, and one Saturday night I was driving home from my boyfriend's house through campus. Literally the night before there had been a report of rape, and another report of attempted rape in close proximity, about 30 minutes apart. As I'm driving near the place where the reports were made, I see this drunk off her ass girl, clearly a freshman, in a tight skimpy dress walk by carrying her heels, completely alone. Suddenly I'm conflicted, because I don't want her to think I'M going to rape her (even though I'm a girl, you never know sketchy shit can happen) but I also don't want her to be in danger. So I slow down and roll down my window, and shout out to her, asking if she wants a ride. The funny thing is she was so drunk the thought that I might be dangerous doesn't even cross her mind. She stumbles up to the car window and says in a stupid, sorority girl voice "Whaaat?" So I offer her a ride, explain that I'm not going to hurt her and that there were recently reports of rape in this area, and I just want her to be safe. She gets in the car and directs me to her dorm, the whole time drunkenly rambling about how drunk she was and how her friends ditched her. She offered to pay me many times, each time I denied. It was a funny experience, and I'm glad I helped her even if she wasn't gonna get raped.Summary:
Summarize: Hi guys, I have a problem, I think. First I'd like to say we are long distance. My boyfriend of two years has an instagram and he follows a good chunk of considerably attractive girls from school. Out of all of his followers, he mainly follows girls. He favourites their pictures and what not. Well, I'm uncomfortable with this. Is that wrong? I have told him that with the amount of girls he looks at, at school, it makes me feel like I'm not as attractive to him, and basically like shit. He's told me that he does it for "social" reasons and not just because he finds them attractive. I honestly don't know guys.. Is it okay for him to look at bunch of girls at school daily despite me telling him that him going on instagram to look at girls makes me really uncomfortable? IMO, if my boyfriend really loved me he'd stop and wouldn't use it. Side note: He's PROMISED me a million times that he wouldn't because "he cares about my feelings" and "doesn't want to hurt me". What's your opinion guys?Summary:
Summarize: Long story short, we had been fighting. Then I discovered he sent messages to his ex proclaiming he still loved her, and that he thought she was the one but didn't know if this was the right time for them to be together. After he was caught, and I confronted him we've been on a roller-coaster of a ride. He regrets messaging her, he cut off all contact with her, He apologized to me, He's been beating himself up since then. He doesn't feel like he deserves a second chance, but I've chosen to give him one - ONLY because it was just messages, and we had been fighting every day before it... I was trying to be understanding. He told me he didn't feel loved anymore, and he was scared I would just leave him one night, so instead of talking to me he secluded himself back to a "safe time". He now admits that was the wrong choice and a huge mistake. We haven't been fighting so much since this, Just kinda taking it day by day. I love him very much, but I don't trust him anymore, which I know is natural at this point. When I see him I still get that fluttery feeling inside, and when he calls on his lunch to talk to me I answer happily to hear from him... I know I can't expect things to be just fine right away, I know it's going to be hard and it's going to be back and forth... When I am not working and he goes to work I am incredibly sad. I can't think about anything but him, and our situation, and I just want to cry and lay in bed. When I am at work and he has the day off, all I want to do is talk to him or be at home with him. Doesn't help that I hate my job. When we're together we're okay, when I am alone I feel myself doubting that we can pull through this. Thats why I am considering a break. I was thinking we would try to take a week long break. We live together though, and I don't have my license. We share 1 vehicle and we both work. My job is too far to walk , and I work hours that would make it unsafe for me to walk or have someone else drive me. We also live with my parents, and if they knew why we were taking a break they'd never let him move back in. So even if we took a break, we'd be seeing each other every day? Think it's pointless to take a break at that point? Should we just consider working things out together at home? I would also like to add, had he sent messages like that to ANY OTHER WOMAN, I would have left. When he told me he was hurting, scared, and thought I was going to leave him - I felt the same way about him. I understood he was retreating back to something he felt was safe and someone who immediately reciprocated his affection. There's history there, it was safe, it was familiar. Just because I understood, did and does not make it okay. If it ever happens again I'm done, and I am gone. Had it been some random woman and gone to physical measures too, I would have left him that night.Summary:
Summarize: Photo Album]( I had a question about this guitar a few weeks ago and posted it [here]( Story: ended up passing on it at first about 3 weeks ago, but I knew I was going to regret not buying it and figured I would be able to sell it on Craigslist if I didn't like it (store has a 2 day return policy). After seeing the generally positive feedback from /r/guitar, and dreaming about playing the Gretsch, I had to go back and pull the trigger. I went to the store with credit card in hand, but unfortunately the guitar was not on the racks. After an inquiry it turned out that they had sold it that morning. Not to be discouraged I asked if they had any more Gretsch's in the back, and by some miracle they had an identical model (or maybe no miracle since this is Gretsch's most popular model); 28 out of 30 days into the police hold. Turns out this one was much cleaner than the last one I had played a month ago, and generally sounded better. I talked them into letting take it home that day, as well as for $450 instead of $500, with a soft case. After playing it for about a week, I could not be more happy. The stock pickups don't sound as good as TV Jones might with this guitar, but I'm very happy with the sound I'm getting. I might be talked into doing the mod, but according to TV Jones' Youtube channel, it requires drilling new pickup holes and plugging the current ones, which I'm not that keen on doing. The bass is perfect for chunky rhythm playing, and the medium and treble sound amazing for lead and twang. Strings go out of tune but it's probably due to them being somewhat old, and the Bigsby tremolo in general.Summary:
Summarize: Freshman year- My Gf and I had been out most if the night at a friends apartment making weed butter and then a bunch of edibles. Between all the butter that had gotten on us while we cooked and all the edibles we ate we are both sky high. We get back to my on campus apartment, nobody's home. My three roommates all stumble in loudly about 30 mins later drunk as hell, they had been a some party. We are sharing the stories of our nights when we suddenly hear a shriek from outside. We are all fucked up so none of us really react until we hear a girl running down our hall screaming "help help!" Me and my four roommates all rush outside, my gf and a couple other girls stay behind in the room. We get in the hall and this panicked girl is just sayin"upstairs upstairs please you guys have to do help!" We are all way too fucked up to know what to do so we all just bolt for the stairs and run up to the third floor. We throw open the door to the hall to just see the walls covered in blood. Like fucking everywhere in HUGE streaks across the walls and big semi-soaked in puddles on the carpet. Despite being high as shit I am the most sober one of the four of us so i took the lead and ran towards this writhing body on the ground, then notice there is a girl crying hysterically nearbye and some shirtless dude holding her. This kid we all knew is just in a heap on the floor, he has this massive gash on his head that is just hemorrhaging blood and there is this huge rock like two feet to his left covered in blood. So I grab the kid and using what training I can remember while I'm so fucked up my roommates and I try to to talk to him and carefully rolled him onto his back. Although the whole time he keeps trying to sit up and grab at the rock while making this just like guttural moan. " Jack (not his real name) what's going on?" "Unnnnnggggg" "Jack come on dude speak to me what the fuck happened." "Unnnnngggggg" roommates:"Steve what do we do?!?" "Shit, well if he can't communicate we don't have a choice call 911" (bear in mind we all liked this kid and new that if we called the paramedics and cops this would be it for him at school) roommates look at me hesitantly but say" alright FUCK" So roommate A runs off to call for help while B,C, and I try to piece together what's happening while stopping the blood from gushing out of jacks head. Shirtless dude" we were watching a movie and suddenly we hear a knock on the door, Girl went to answer it and as soon as she opened the door this crazy fucker just decked her in the face!" Although he didn't elaborate more we were never sure how much of the damage on jacks body was dealt by shirtless guy but I have no doubt it was more than a little. While he is telling this to roommate C I am looking jack over and that's when I look in his eyes to see they were dark red and had pupils the size of dimes" FUCKING SHIT! He's high out of his god damned mind!" Turns out elsewhere on campus earlier that night jack had eaten several candies laced with LSD and was tripping his balls off. So anyway at around that point two cops, one of which I had a bit of a history with suddenly burst into the hallway guns drawn. We all throw our hands up as we are being aimed at and so jacks head starts gushing more blood. "What the fuck is going on?!" Dick cop yells "Don't shoot! We found him like this, he needs attention now! Also I think he's on drugs because he is completely nonresponsive, and keeps trying to hit himself with that rock!" I shouted gesturing to the big bloody stone. The cops thankfully lowered their guns and holstered them but then dick cop pulls out his taser and starts threatening jack with it ordering him to get down and comply or be tased. Roommates B,C,and Start yelling" No STOP! He doesn't understand what your saying let us just hold him down he's fine he just needs medical attention!" "Back away from him NOW!" So we all stood up, pretty well covered in blood, and did as he said. Jack pulled himself towards the wall and leaned against it but roommate B grabbed the rock and moved it away from Jack, who still kept reaching for it and the cop kept threatening to taze him if he kept moving, not that jack understood. Eventually the paramedics arrived and carted away Jack, and treat the girl who got a huge black eye. Never heard from jack again personally but B did and he said that according to Jack he had no recollection of how he wound up in our building or why he punched the Girl, but that he kept hitting himself with the rock because he saw it as his brain and was scared if he didn't get it back into his head he would die. So ya that was the craziest thing I saw in college although I do have some other good stories as well. Always remember kids, drugs can be fun, but they can also be very very VERY dangerous. Edit: To everyone who has a problem with how I wrote it, I hope it did piss you off and that you didn't read it. People like you deserve it and I'm not going to change it. If you expect well written and properly edited stories, read a book not reddit. For all of you too lazy/requested it:Summary:
Summarize: This wasn't today but over a span of about a week. I'll start off by giving some information about my SO; he's the horniest guy I've ever met and basically needs to have sex every day. I normally don't have a problem with this but last week I was visited by the red tide so the gates were closed. Well he couldn't keep it in his pants long enough for me to finish my period, so he just busted down the gate and earned his red wings. Not just one day out of the 5 day cycle; 3 days then 2 after it ended. If you are unaware vaginas are basically bacteria holes and need to be kept very clean. They also get irritated by pretty much anything. After 5 days on my period and 2 after; my vagina had clearly had enough of his dick. I'd been feeling slightly irritated but I thought it would pass; I thought wrong. I awoke this morning to a burning/itching feeling all over my lady parts. And it was intense. I'm not sure if it's infected or irritated but I have no way to get any antibiotics unless I ask my SO to take me to Walmart before work.Summary:
Summarize: I don't want to give too much info because he is also a redditor, and I'd hate for him to stumble upon this and figure out its about him before we talk. There's no big problems between us,we've been together a little over a year, I'm just realising that we aren't as compatible as I thought we would be and I don't want to be with him for the rest of my life. The problem for me is that this is my first real relationship and I don't know how to do the whole breaking up thing, we live together, but everything is under my name. I wouldn't mind him still staying with me until he can get a place of his own, I just don't want to drag our relationship on any further knowing that we aren't compatible and it's not going anywhere.Summary:
Summarize: It's a dog-eat-dog world out there. It's the bloody apocalypse for fuck sake. Some people don't seem to understand that. When you have hard-earned gear you want to keep it, things up north aren't like they are on the coast. It's not like being a bandit means you just sit in Elektro or Cherno all day farming new spawns. What's the value in that?Summary:
Summarize: As a female, I sometimes look at my gender and just ... [What?]( ... [Are you kidding me?]( I'm often ashamed by the fact my gender is so complicated and stupid. Why they think the way they do, when I'm here, pretty much "one of the guys". I've had many guy friends come to me with their relationship problems, and no matter how much I want to tell them to just get their ballsack while they still have it and RUN ... I do try my best to assist them in the better understanding of women. For example; Why girls say nothing is wrong when OBVIOUSLY something is wrong. Ohhh boy. There is no winning that one. NOTE: Since people cannot understand that I'm not calling every single female on the world a stupid moron, I'll have to put this little note here: It's the gender stereotype. Many men, and other women, can't understand why females do what they do. There are many, MANY brilliant female minds and women who have changed the world. Obviously I'm not here about them. Common sense.Summary:
Summarize: New to this sub, this may have been, did a search couldn't find much... It wasn't a long search. So I work in a country house in the UK, we mainly serve weddings and other private functions and serve Sunday lunch. The day ideally goes: Arrive 9am lay up room for 11am People begin arriving 11:30am Service begins 12pm Bookings stop at 2:30pm Everyone has left by 3:30pm That's how it goes most weeks! But every couple of weeks we have one table usually of 2 people that decide they want to stay, possible until 5pm, like two weeks ago, It really annoys me how customers thing it's ok to be the last couple in the venue buy an hour and a half, not buying drinks and have finished eating, they're just talking, we have so much to do and we can't do any of it until these two people have left. Does anyone else have this problem, btw we aren't allowed to ask them to leave or say we're closing.Summary:
Summarize: So this girl and I have been talking for about a six weeks, and things have been going great - we have a lot of things in common, we've really hit it off, and we've both expressed interest through mutual friends. But here's the thing - we haven't really talked about what we want out of the potential relationship. We're both goal-driven people, so neither of us are really looking for anything super serious that could prevent us from accomplishing said goals. We just hung out yesterday, and I couldn't be happier with how things went. However, I couldn't help but feel upset knowing that we both want something together, but our determination to complete our goals is keeping us from letting ourselves see where things go. Hearing what she's said about how she views "us" is nice, knowing that she shares the same feelings and wouldn't be opposed to having a relationship later on, but it almost hurts at the same time. I don't know how she feels about this, but part of me feels as if I really, really want to at least give things a shot now, because we're only doing ourselves an injustice by not allowing ourselves to express our feelings and seeing where things could go. When we talk, it's almost as if there's this "elephant in the room" that we should be really happy about and talk about, but we're too afraid to talk about it in-depth. I mean, we've met each other parents, and they seemed like they supported it. Also, a lot of our friends thought we were already together, and they seemed like they really liked the idea of us together; they said we'd be great together. We both already really like each other, so what do we have to lose?Summary:

Summarize: This is a common theme in most of the US, typically capitals were established and never changed. Most are near the center of a state for convenience of travel(this before the car/train/etc). Now it looks fucking stupid, take Illinois for example where you have Chicago with half of the states population, but the capital is the small city of Springfield 8 hours away.Summary:
Summarize: My husband and I have always communicated well. We've been together for 8 years and we know the importance of being honest with each other. For the last month or so he had taken a second job at night driving trucks. (He no longer has this job) He would ride with this woman to help her out a couple nights a week for 9 hours or so. And she would drive him to another job in town the other nights of the week. This woman has a husband and children so I wasn't too threatened by the fact that my husband was spending so much time with her. He would talk about her to me and tell me some of her stories and say that they thought alike and he liked her as a friend. There was a time or two where I wondered if something could be going on but I trust him so much I would put it out of my mind. A few days ago he sat me down and told me that he fell in love with her. He said nothing at all physical happened, but he developed these feelings for her and realized that he was in love. He said when he realized this he didn't do what he should have, which was to end all contact with her and tell me about it. Instead he wanted to spend further time with her. In the hope that she would reject his feelings, he told her how he felt. She neither rejected him or accepted his feelings. So for several weeks he brought it up over and over with her hoping she would put an end to I guess whatever thoughts of love he was having for her. Finally she tells him that she will stick with her husband until her kids are grown and until then nothing is going to happen. He said he then thought about our relationship and if he wanted to stay in it. He knew that having feelings for her and being around her so much was wrong and wanted to make sure he was still committed to me. He came to the decision that he does still want to spend the rest of his life with me, if I would still want him. My first reaction to him telling me this was disbelief. I was obviously so naive to think that neither of us would ever 'feel' for others, especially just because they're married with kids. My second reaction was blaming myself. What did I do wrong to make him fall in love with someone else? We've talked about it quite a bit and I've asked every question that's come to mind about the situation. I feel that he is being completely open and honest with me. He said he doesn't really know what his reaction would have been if she had accepted him then and there. He says he thinks he would still have chose me but he honestly doesn't know. He swore to me that I wasn't his 'second choice' because she had rejected him and that he wouldn't be interested if she contacted him in 5 years to hook up or start something because he's dedicated himself to me. When this conversation came up between us he asked me how I would feel if he kept in contact with her. He said he still sees her as a friend and cares for her and would like to keep in touch just over the phone every few months or so. I told him I was absolutely uncomfortable with it. He started to get upset saying that I couldn't tell him who he could or couldn't talk to. I reminded him that I didn't say that, I told him how I would feel about it. So he never said he wouldn't. And that just makes me feel sick to think of him still talking to her, having feelings for her. I guess my biggest thing about all this is how I am reacting to it. I feel like I should be so mad at him but instead I'm looking at myself for my flaws and what I did to cause this to happen. I'm so scared that in a few years this will all come up again because she's 'ready' for him. I completely understand him when he says that he can't control who he cares about and the feelings that developed. He is very apologetic about spending time with her when he shouldn't have. But no matter how many times he tells me that he wants to spend the rest of his life with me, that he loves me and he chose me, I just still feel betrayed. I feel like he mentally cheated on me (excuse the dramatics). I don't know how to handle this. I told him I didn't want to leave him, I'm still in this marriage. We will be moving soon and I keep thinking this will be behind us. But I feel like I am just sweeping it under the rug and it's all going to come to a head someday. We still talk about it daily and I still ask him questions about things, which he answers very honestly. But I also feel like he's going to get sick of talking about it, but I need the reassurance. I don't know how to act around him now. I feel like everything has changed, but it hasn't at the same time .Summary:
Summarize: This is mostly a rant, but I would appreciate any input, advice, or general observations about the situation. During a recent visit to her school's open house/freshmen orientation, my sister managed to describe several people as "creepy". First, we were swimming in our hotel's pool. We were the only two people in the pool, though there were two other women sunning themselves next to it, when a fat bald man walked into the pool area. My sister shot me a look, which I interpreted as "Oh well, it was fun to have the pool to ourselves for a while." I shrugged and we continued to bob up and down in the water, gossiping and comparing our complexions. The man who'd just entered took off his shoes and shirt, put on a pair of goggles, and proceeded to swim up and down the length of the pool. We'd been in the pool for maybe an hour anyways, so when my sister said she wanted to leave I figured she was just done with the water. But as we were walking back to our room she says, "Can you believe how creepy that guy was?" No, I could not believe his creepiness, because I hadn't noticed it, he was just using the pool (just like us!). "But Moxiecontin, he was a fat bald guy, and he was wearing goggles ! That's so creepy!" She giggled and I made some faces but did not continue the conversation, I wanted this to be a fun trip with no drama (and she's 18, she hasn't quite mastered thinking before she speaks). But then we were at a restaurant for dinner, and she feels the need to point out a man sitting by himself at the bar. "Look at that guy" she says, "So creepy! Who sits by themselves at the bar?" I shushed her (didn't want him to hear her!), and theorized that maybe he was hungry and didn't want to take up a whole table or booth. "Yeah, but only creepy people have to eat at restaurants alone , he should just by some ramen." I asked her if she would rather be eating ramen than the (fairly) tasty mexican food we were enjoying, and she just stuck her tongue out at me and the conversation moved on. At about 11pm that night we were hitting the hotel's vending machines, filling up on snacks and soda, when a man walked past the alcove where the machines are. I caught his eye over the pile of soda cans in my arms and he greeted us, while he continued walking, with a "How y'all doing tonight?" "Doin' great!" I replied, brandishing my sugary treasure at him, "Aw, that's nice" he said, never having stopped walking or saying anything bad. My sister turns to me and says, "Holy shit that was so fucking creepy!" Now, this was not a creepy exchange. We live in the south, where if you make unexpected eye contact with someone it's okay (and often demanded) that you politely acknowledge it. I told her that there was nothing "creepy" about that, he was just saying hello. He didn't even stop! But I was wrong, he was creepy because he was wearing a striped tank top and shorts that showed his knees. So in the course of five hours she'd picked out three strangers and gone into detail about why they were creepy. Of course, the next morning it starts again. The man using the waffle machine before us? "Whoa, creepy". I didn't even bother with that one, but I think he could hear her. But then a new development! Women can be creepy too! While I checked us out she stood outside next to the cigarette butt dispenser puffing away on her new bad habit, and another woman came outside and did the same thing. She was middle-aged and thin, and I said hello to her as I collected my sister and headed to the car. "That old lady was creepy" she says once she closes her door. "Why, did she say something to you?" "No, she just stood there and smoked" EXACTLY LIKE YOU WERE?! I pointed that out, and she laughed and said, "Yeah, but I'm not like that." Once at the school she used the word several more times, usually to describe why she didn't want to sit in a particular area during the presentations. "No, that guy looks creepy" "No! That girl's got a wolf on her shirt, she's fucking creepy " "Oh god, that guy's dad is wearing overalls, what a creepy family, we can't sit next to them!" I just tuned it out. On the drive home she even called a passenger in another car creepy! Besides her labeling of other people as "creepy", we had a great time. I generally enjoy her company, and she's a very bright girl with an awesome future ahead of her. She received a "full ride" to the fantastic private university of her choice, and she's talented beyond belief! She has a large group of friends, and a smaller group of really great friends, and things just generally seem perfect for her. But I'm worried that her quickness to put strangers down is going to hurt her in the future, especially starting school without anyone she knows going with her. I'm also starting to think of her as annoying, and I don't want to think badly of my own sister.Summary:
Summarize: This is because more people have access to more website writing software and more websites are made. Inevitably there will be a range of websites from shitty half arsed ones put together by people who don't know what they're doing, through seamless sites which you won't notice any issues with, right up to cutting edge coding that pushes hardware limitations as people try out new stuff.Summary:
Summarize: Hey folks, as the title says I'm travelling to visit the girl I like next month. She doesn't know that I have a crush on her and would like to ask her out before I go to see her so I'm not blindsiding her with something while I'm there visiting. How could I ask her in a manner that she knows that I'm asking her for a date but if she's not interested it won't make the visit weird?Summary:
Summarize: Sc2 was the driving force in e-sports last year, everyone in the sc2 community was extremely passionate and optimistic about where these numbers will take us. Some speculated tv and some believed it will become mainstream. This year it is clear sc2 isnt doing nearly as well as LoL or Dota 2 and its very disheartening for us as a community. We want sc2 to grow and lasting for as long as CS 1.6 or Broodwar. Thing is, that probably wont happen and its not so bad. As long as there are 30k to 50k viewers for tournaments the game is alive. As long as you enjoy playing sc2 and have the ability to find a match in less than a minute the game is very alive. Think about the Quake or Cs 1.6 scene or even the American broodwar scene. They didn't generate nearly as much stream or VOD viewers or even have as big of an esports fanbase. We as a community have been so focused on numbers but numbers shouldn't be a concern for fans. I'm fine with sc2 remaining as a relativity niche source of entertainment for the next few years until the end of its run. It will be a good run, one that I will remember more than WoW or any other game I've invested time into.Summary:
Summarize: Virgin here (f). Seeing a total non virgin (m). Was upfront from the start that I have D/s fantasies, turned out he liked to Dom. Perfect, right? Wrong... I am totally submissive when we sext (good girl, sir, doing what he wants when he tells me, nudes, that stuff). Recently we messed around a bit and he was teasing me and said 'ask me properly' so I of course said something along the lines of 'please, sir' and I felt SO awkward. And I'm just like, how can I be more confident to be submissive in practice rather than just online? I know I am irl, I adore it when he spanks me and nothing pleases me more than when I'm pleasing him, it's just an anxiety block. I think it's because I've never been with anyone but him before and adding the anxiety of being submissive along with getting over the nervousness of everything being a 'first'. Thankyou, and I hope I wasn't too vague :)Summary:
Summarize: Quite honestly, I feel at a loss. I feel kind of mad. Not at keto. Maybe at myself. For a month I kept at this new lifestyle. Tons of leafy greens with my meals full of fat and proteins. Carbs counted for less than 20 g/day. Growing up in an Asian family, I've received my fair share of criticism for refusing rice at the table--but that's 45 g of carb per bowl I can't afford. My family always throws away the fat off the meat, so I've received a bit of criticism for eating that as well. But I powered through that for 30 straight days. Survived through the keto flu. Shot for 1200 calories/day. No condiments. Slip-ups would never exceed past 1500 calories (which truthfully happened 4 or 5 times). Ran 4 miles once a week. 40 oz of water everyday. I've miserably refused favourite snacks, desserts, and foods I've once desperately loved. I skipped out on cake on my brother's birthday. Turned down all the fancy little cakes, tarts, and sweets at the dessert bar of some fancy birthday banquet. I've ignored a pantry full of crackers and biscuits, a freezer full of ice cream, and a fridge full of fruit. While my family indulged on ice cream bars at night, I sipped water and nibbled on a handful of raw almonds and 90% chocolate. 30th day. I weighed myself. It was the same as my starting weight. At first I felt okay. I started this change for a healthier me anyways, right? But I slowly grew bitter throughout the day because really I did this so I could lose weight in a healthy way. Now it's been brought up that my lifestyle hasn't been worth it. "How the hell could you lose weight eating so much fat anyways?" I feel like I let down keto by being an example of failure. I believed in the science so much that I wanted to prove that it works. The pressures of mentally calorie counting for the past 30 days finally reached its breaking point and I fell back into old binging habits. I probably consumed double, if not triple, my daily caloric intake yesterday. Carb/calorie counting went to hell. I don't even know what went wrong. I almost feel like carb counting doesn't even matter. Or calorie counting. I feel completely stuck at this weight. I have no energy. I feel hungry most times. Arguably, slipping 300 calories over 4-5 times has impeded my weight loss, but I've tried losing weight through calorie counting without carb-counting and have at LEAST lost 5 pounds in 30 days. [freedieting calorie calculator]( claims I need 1329 calories/day for weight loss, 1600 for maintenance, and 1088 for extreme fat loss. Should I be opting for 1000 cal/day?

Summarize: The Elder Scrolls games are all single player RPGs centred around the player character... They're very much about you exploring the world on your own and discovering things while being immersed in said world, feeling like you are the first player to have done so... Not to mention your growth into being the most powerful individual around capable of fucking up everyone else's shit. That does not translate at all into an MMO by virtue of the fact that now you've got thousands of player characters running around. The exploration aspect is watered down because you're not the only player character in the world to discover it, and then everyone else is equally growing in power, so you no longer have that aspect of uniquely being this powerful motherfucker unmatched by anyone else.Summary:
Summarize: To all the forever alone commenters: I was in your shoes not that long ago. I spent way too much time last semester bumming around at home, not meeting anyone or growing at all. But then I realized that I was squandering the short amount of time that I have in college, the period in our adult lives when we have the most freedom and the smallest amount of responsibility. So I said fuck it, I'm going to learn how to meet people and make new friends. It took some time to get over the fear of approaching strangers, but I got better at it. A few months ago I was meeting nobody and not enjoying myself at all, but after changing my outlook from "I'm socially inept and should just accept that fact" to "I'm socially inept but it's within my power to change it", my life has gone from mediocre to downright legendary. The only thing that's keeping you "forever alone" is your own mindset. It doesn't matter if you're ugly or utterly socially incompetent, you have the ability to improve yourself and learn to meet new people. If you'd rather be spending your weekend nights partying instead of surfing the internet, go spend time improving your social skills and making friends. Take it from a CS nerd that spent his adolescence playing video games instead of developing proper social skills. You have the ability to free yourself from the "forever alone" curse. Treat it like an RPG: your charisma stat is absolute shit and the only way to improve it is by starting conversations with everyone.Summary:
Summarize: I've been dipping for a few years now and i have tried snuff a few times, always copenhagen though. If you have had any natural flavors, it tastes the same except a bit stronger. If you're going to try it i advise that you know how to pack cans really well. The buzz is good and noticeable and last for about 30 minutes or so. But after it all done and you want to get rid of it, it's a bitch. I recommend having water or something else nearby to rinse your mouth out afterwards.Summary:
Summarize: Hi Reddit! This is going to be quite lengthy because it's been a crazy last few months for me with this friend. First off, I started working at this hospital in January 2015. She started at the hospital in August of 2015. We're both obviously relatively close in age and have quite a lot in common so we get along great. We also work in the same department, so we see and work with each other a lot on projects, grants, etc. So starting back at the end of April 2016, this is when she started telling me more about her relationship problems. We slowly started getting closer, would go out to dinner together, hang outside of work, etc. What's even more convenient is that she lived with her boyfriend during this time period and I only lived 5 minutes from them. I remember specifically when was the first time she called me crying. I was on my way back from Destin with my SO (who was visiting me - we're in an LDR), and she calls me crying saying that her and her boyfriend got into a big fight and if she could come over. I told her yes, but I wouldn't be home for another couple of hours. So I picked her up once I got back into town, and we went back to my place. She started telling me about the fight and what happened and there were horrendous things said which I found quite disrespectful (he told her to get the f-ck out of his house). I felt sorry for my SO, because it was also his last night with me and he had to deal with all of this. Fast forward to Mid June, they continued to work on their problems. She came over one evening to bring me a gift to bring home to my grandparents because my grandpa was hospitalized. A couple of hours after she left, she called me crying again. The issue here was that her boyfriend had decided to leave her to go party with his friends, and she found it inconsiderate to leave her after they've been together all day at HIS friend's baby shower where she didn't know anyone. So she comes back over to my place and here starts the bashing party (I'll include all of their issues below): What upset her the most was that he said that he would choose his family over her. She doesn't feel the support that she needs from him. If anything, she's been supporting him the past 2 years that they've been together - pushing him to finally finish his bachelors that took him 7 years (and as far as I'm concerned, he had no reason for it to take that long). She says that sometimes she feels ashamed of him when it comes to introducing him to her family, friends, cohort. She has masters and an idea of what she wants to do next with her life whereas, he doesn't know what he wants to do with his bachelors in chemistry. The boyfriend's mom and sister are causing drama because they said that the girlfriend raised her voice at the dad when he asked her to stay and not move out. The boyfriend later asked his dad in private about it and said that the girlfriend did not raise her voice at him. There's more to add to the list, but I just can't think of them all at the moment. So this last big fight happened 3 days before she went to California for a week to visit her family. After she came back from California, she moved in with me (I have an extra bedroom in my townhouse) and we (my brother and I who's been listening to her vent) thought they were going to break up. Not only did they decide to stay together and work things out (for the third time, might I add), BUT THEY DECIDE TO GET MARRIED IN DECEMBER. In her explanation, this is the next step that needs to be taken for him to take her seriously and put her first. In my mind, I thought this was probably the worst reason to get married. They don't even plan on telling his parents. They were just going to do a courthouse wedding. Honestly, I don't know what to do. I disagree with the marriage, and I've told her many times that I don't think it's a good idea because you can't go into this marriage with these problems. She thinks they'll get better after the marriage, but I can only imagine otherwise. It's also difficult, because I don't want to cause any strain on our friendship because we also WORK together. I see her 8 hours at work, I see her at home outside of work. The only time I don't see her is when we're sleeping. I feel guilty that I disagree with their marriage just because of her reasoning for getting married and also at the points in their lives. She wants me to go wedding dress shopping with her and such, but I feel two-faced about supporting her in that way when she knows I disagree with this marriage. My boss tell me that I should just let her do as she pleases, and it'll be a lesson learned for her. I don't want her to resent me for not being supportive or to resent me for not stopping her if I knew it was a bad idea. Can anyone offer any insight? Has anyone ever been in this sort of situation? How did it turn out for you?Summary:
Summarize: It was the matinee hours during a very slow week day while working at the movies. A rather overweight woman comes hobbling in with her husband. Actually no; a morbidly obese lady. Anyways, they go to see the movie Battleship. About halfway through, I see her exit the theater, walks as fast as her fat legs can move her straight to her car. My co-worker and I find this slightly precarious. We decide to exit and sneak around stealthily to watch what she was up to without her husband. BAD IDEA. She began disrobing I kid you not (it was a struggle inside a car for a woman her size). Once completely naked, she gets out of the car, layers flapping and all. She proceeds to perform the fucking rain dance. In the middle of the parking lot . My friend and I were petrified yet laughing our asses off. We ran back in without her noticing and got her husband who was in the main area looking for his wife. We told him she was out there and all that we saw. His exact words were, "Oh dear god not again."Summary:
Summarize: Aerys was a crazy fuck that burnt people alive just out of completely imagined paranoia and was fully ready to destroy the largest city in the continent believing he would be reborn as a dragon amidst it all and was in general such a mad man that he managed to incite a revelion that took down a dinasty that lasted almost 300 years. Now, it can certainly be argued that Dany's choice in doing this was unwise but I really don't see anything "mad" about it. 1) She's very angry on a very personal level because Barristan was a loyal friend and advisor. People can often do nasty things when they're in that mindset without necesarily being crazy. 2) All of them, even if not directly related to this incident, are in fact slave masters; cruel as hell and each and every single one of them surely wants to see her dead. They are not their friends, they are not innocent people in general terms and it's logical to assume that at least some of them are involved with the Sons of The Harpy.Summary:
Summarize: I used to donate often, but one guy REALLY messed up both my arms and put me in so much agony that I don't think I could go back. I had no problems really until that guy who had no idea what the hell he was doing. "Where do they normally draw" Right here, on my left arm (did it enough to know well) "Well, I'm going with your right arm, and going for a fairly deep vein... Cue me going bug-eyed and like "are you joking me?" face... Guy went for it, dug around, couldn't get it, arm started to bruise and was done on that side. "Ok, that didn't work, can we try the other arm" OH you mean like I friggin suggested in the first place?! Sure. It's right about here they go in usually... "Ah, well I think I'll try right here instead because this spot looks perfect" Because your first instincts on my right arm was so spot-on? Yup, couldn't get anything a second time, two severely bruised and painful arms and I had a rough few weeks. Had to take it easy stocking at work because my arms were useless.Summary:

Summarize: Hey, guys Sorry for all the information I'm about to give you. I just really want some help from people who know all the facts. I am 21f and my boyfriend is 22m. We go to the same college, and have been dating for over a year, and we live together. When we first started dating, we had sex a lot. It seems like everyday that we hung out ended in sex. It was awesome. Things started to slow down a little bit a few months ago. When we started living together... He is a Christian dude, except not very extreme. He turned to religion when his mom passed away last year. He was "saved" at a church camp he chaperoned over last summer, and is truly believing and passionate about God. He used to sometimes cry and say he wished I would just be "saved." I've told him that I feel silly about it and that I'm just not ready for it. So he has put it behind. I go to church with him and never try to disrespect what he believes and we are both okay with that. Except when it comes to sex. I am on birth control. It has been 2 years since I had an implanon put in. I never get a period. At first my sex drive was extremely decreased. I went a year without sex and was completely okay. But now my sex drive is through the roof. I constantly think about sex and am always horny and ready to go! Me and my boyfriend have great sex and I love it. The only problem is now that he won't have sex with me. The first month we lived together, our sex was normal as ever. It was everyday and sometimes twice a day. Now it is once every two weeks if I am lucky. Every time I try to prompt sex with him, he says that we do it too much and he is "straying from the lord." He will keep saying this until he reaches the brink of his horniness I guess. Then he'll have me give him a super quick blow job, but no sex usually. And that makes me all the more horny. But he never messes around with me or anything. I feel like he looks down on me for being so weak/horny. I have to beg and beg for him to have sex with me, but he will never give in until he wants it. And I can't deny him when he wants it, because I already want it so bad. He says all I care about in our relationship is sex, but it's not true. It just builds up inside and it's all I can think about. I feel like a horny man or something. Like other girls aren't like this. He says the devil is tempting me and I need to speak with God. I don't agree. He will have a HUGE boner that I can feel whenever I'm trying to seduce him, but he will still say no to me! I don't get it. Why is it so hard for him to do? :/ I also find that I masturbate way too much. It can be from at least 3 to 10 times a day. :( It doesn't even calm down my sex drive. At all. I just keep going and going. After sex though, I feel relieved and 'finished.' I can achieve an orgasm through masturbation, but I never feel finished, and can go right back to masturbating a minute later. I'm so embarrassed about it, and he doesn't even know I do it. He doesn't masturbate, (unless he somehow does it at work) because I am with him all the time at home. We shower together, sleep in the same bed, and everything. He will have a boner in the shower and won't let me anywhere near it. I just don't get it at all. Am I pushing him? I feel like if genders were reversed here, it would be really bad. I just don't know how to calm myself down. What should I do??? Other than our sex life, our relationship is amazing. He is everything I ever wanted, and I love him with all my heart. He makes me soooo happy, and I definitely do not want to end things with him over this. He doesn't want to get married until he has finished college and has a steady job. He wants to have a huge church wedding or something and be financially stable. That could be 4+ years before anything like that happens. I've suggested no sex at all until then if it makes him uncomfortable and he said "WHAT! No? I just mean we need to slow down. Not stop." But he doesn't realize that I'm not getting anything. So if this all has to be slow "until marriage" is it going to get worse? How should I talk to him? It's very embarrassing to me, because I'm very shy, especially about sex. So I don't know how to approach this. Especially when he gets all Christian on me. Side note - If it is my birth control that has driven me to being a nymphomaniac, it won't be another year until it is removed. But I'm not sure if it is the cause or not. If so does anyone know a way to counter it or decrease my sex drive?Summary:
Summarize: This isn't really a fair comparison, considering the fact that He-Man actually has a reason to be buffed up. I've never watched the show but I'm pretty sure he fights someone in pretty much every episode. Is he comically proportioned? Yes, but at least they can justify it and as such it doesn't seem out of place. You can't argue for Barbie's proportions the same way you can for He-Man. What does her appearance prove other than the fact that she can starve herself thin?Summary:
Summarize: You're getting paid because you have a big audience. A big audience will always bring plenty of toxicity. See: Everyone who was famous, ever.

Summarize: So around a year and a half ago I was exiting my friends house after consuming two delicious Icehouse beverages just barely tipsy. Apparently the bar was not in the cards that night as I slipped and fell on a patch of ice. I get a rocking concussion and what I assume to be a minor laceration. Best part was when I stumble back inside to clean myself up my drunk friend goes "Yo dude it's okay I'm a lifeguard". I move my hand and his reaction was probably the only thing that kept me from going into shock.Summary:
Summarize: Whoa hold on, don't go fucking me until you hear my explanation. Apparently I do have to go into detail because you're quick to make assumptions as well. I'm not contradicting myself. There are many kids that are diagnosed that -do- need these drugs. It helps them with focus, can calm them down if they're hyperactive, ect. Parents cannot control that, an when it becomes an issue in school they try to find means to help, i.e., prescriptions that can help with the brain activity. On the other hand, there are parents that just can't control their kid. Younger ones mind you, that don't know any better. Or how about five or six children that they get tired of and just drive over to the doctor's office for Six different prescriptions that will make the boy or girl a mindless zombie in school and at home so the parent(s) don't have to deal with them. Also they can sell it. It's not big on the market, but it is an addictive narcotic. I actually help take care of my fiancé's nephew who has Autism. He talked constantly and his therapist prescribed him Adderall (he has other problems too, but I'm not going into detail). Total zombie. We took him off of it. We like the silence, but hated him like that.Summary:
Summarize: I once asked my mom if when boys got older they turned into girls. She said yes. So for a little while while I was around 6, I was moderately terrified that I was going to sprout a vagina at any moment. After my brain kicked in, I asked her why she confirmed my crazy theory and it turns out she hadn't been paying any attention to what I was asking.Summary:
Summarize: Sounds like chest-thumping to me. It could very well be true. On the other hand, I've lived in several shitty neighborhoods in the last decade and have never had a situation where carrying a gun would have saved me any aggravation or misfortune.

Summarize: This is mostly a rant, but I would appreciate any input, advice, or general observations about the situation. During a recent visit to her school's open house/freshmen orientation, my sister managed to describe several people as "creepy". First, we were swimming in our hotel's pool. We were the only two people in the pool, though there were two other women sunning themselves next to it, when a fat bald man walked into the pool area. My sister shot me a look, which I interpreted as "Oh well, it was fun to have the pool to ourselves for a while." I shrugged and we continued to bob up and down in the water, gossiping and comparing our complexions. The man who'd just entered took off his shoes and shirt, put on a pair of goggles, and proceeded to swim up and down the length of the pool. We'd been in the pool for maybe an hour anyways, so when my sister said she wanted to leave I figured she was just done with the water. But as we were walking back to our room she says, "Can you believe how creepy that guy was?" No, I could not believe his creepiness, because I hadn't noticed it, he was just using the pool (just like us!). "But Moxiecontin, he was a fat bald guy, and he was wearing goggles ! That's so creepy!" She giggled and I made some faces but did not continue the conversation, I wanted this to be a fun trip with no drama (and she's 18, she hasn't quite mastered thinking before she speaks). But then we were at a restaurant for dinner, and she feels the need to point out a man sitting by himself at the bar. "Look at that guy" she says, "So creepy! Who sits by themselves at the bar?" I shushed her (didn't want him to hear her!), and theorized that maybe he was hungry and didn't want to take up a whole table or booth. "Yeah, but only creepy people have to eat at restaurants alone , he should just by some ramen." I asked her if she would rather be eating ramen than the (fairly) tasty mexican food we were enjoying, and she just stuck her tongue out at me and the conversation moved on. At about 11pm that night we were hitting the hotel's vending machines, filling up on snacks and soda, when a man walked past the alcove where the machines are. I caught his eye over the pile of soda cans in my arms and he greeted us, while he continued walking, with a "How y'all doing tonight?" "Doin' great!" I replied, brandishing my sugary treasure at him, "Aw, that's nice" he said, never having stopped walking or saying anything bad. My sister turns to me and says, "Holy shit that was so fucking creepy!" Now, this was not a creepy exchange. We live in the south, where if you make unexpected eye contact with someone it's okay (and often demanded) that you politely acknowledge it. I told her that there was nothing "creepy" about that, he was just saying hello. He didn't even stop! But I was wrong, he was creepy because he was wearing a striped tank top and shorts that showed his knees. So in the course of five hours she'd picked out three strangers and gone into detail about why they were creepy. Of course, the next morning it starts again. The man using the waffle machine before us? "Whoa, creepy". I didn't even bother with that one, but I think he could hear her. But then a new development! Women can be creepy too! While I checked us out she stood outside next to the cigarette butt dispenser puffing away on her new bad habit, and another woman came outside and did the same thing. She was middle-aged and thin, and I said hello to her as I collected my sister and headed to the car. "That old lady was creepy" she says once she closes her door. "Why, did she say something to you?" "No, she just stood there and smoked" EXACTLY LIKE YOU WERE?! I pointed that out, and she laughed and said, "Yeah, but I'm not like that." Once at the school she used the word several more times, usually to describe why she didn't want to sit in a particular area during the presentations. "No, that guy looks creepy" "No! That girl's got a wolf on her shirt, she's fucking creepy " "Oh god, that guy's dad is wearing overalls, what a creepy family, we can't sit next to them!" I just tuned it out. On the drive home she even called a passenger in another car creepy! Besides her labeling of other people as "creepy", we had a great time. I generally enjoy her company, and she's a very bright girl with an awesome future ahead of her. She received a "full ride" to the fantastic private university of her choice, and she's talented beyond belief! She has a large group of friends, and a smaller group of really great friends, and things just generally seem perfect for her. But I'm worried that her quickness to put strangers down is going to hurt her in the future, especially starting school without anyone she knows going with her. I'm also starting to think of her as annoying, and I don't want to think badly of my own sister.Summary:
Summarize: This one's not as scandalous as some of the posts here, but it is a situation where I think your collective advice could really help me out. I've been dating a girl, we'll call her Suzy, for the last month and a half. Suzy is amazing. She's funny, cute, smart, and easy to talk to. I genuinely enjoy being around her. However, Suzy and I have some (hopefully not too glaring) differences. Here's a list: 1) Suzy is waaay into EDM clubs. She doesn't drink or do any drugs (don't ask me how), but loves go to the clubs and dance and do something that involves gloves with lights on the fingers. I do not particularly enjoy any of this. I like to sip a good beer or bourbon at a comfortable bar and talk with friends. I also like to go to sleep before 6AM. 2) Friends. I have many. I have a group of friends that, at it's full reach, is about 30-40 people strong. However, I only really see 5-10 of them on any sort of regular basis. They are all fun, and we've had some amazing times together. Suzy does not have this. Suzy is very much a loner. 3) Sex. Suzy has a lot more experience with sex than I do. That said, I am not inexperienced - I've slept with 8.5 women over the course of six years. All of them more than once. Suzy is at a different level than I am. Suzy has probably hit double that number (or higher). Suzy knows whats-up in the bedroom. In many ways I have found this emasculating. 4) Work. I work 9-5 at a professional firm. My job is very involved and at a high level. Most of our clients pay $50,000+ per month for our services. Suzy works part-time in retail. 5) Education. This one is less of a problem for me, and more something that bothers her. I have a B.A., she is still plugging away at an associates. These differences have created an odd set of emotional responses in me. On one hand I really like this girl - I really like being around her. On the other, we don't do similar things. In fact, much of what she does are things that I would never have considered doing had the two of us not met. I'm not sure that's a bad thing, though. Prior to hanging out with her I would spend the majority of my free time watching Netflix, playing video games, and (surprise) surfing reddit. And I do mean the MAJORITY. Suzy is bringing me out of my comfort zone and I kinda like it. But I'm worried its happening too quickly. As I struggle to keep up with her, I keep putting myself in situations that are embarrassing, or even humiliating. I don't want to appear weak by asking her to slow down, or worse, cause her to get bored and seek entertainment elsewhere. At the same time, I'm getting very sick of embarrassing myself. Here are some fun examples of my recent humiliations: 1) Played poker very poorly. Lost about $60. Turns out - there's a difference between playing poker with your dad and actual gambling. 2) Was The World's Most Awkward Person at an EDM club. Wore a collared shirt, fancy jeans, leather shoes, and a fucking gold watch. Did. not. fit. in. Also - I have no idea how to dance. And feel too embarrassed to cut loose. 3) Psyched myself out before sex and popped off waaaay too early the first couple times. Round three was much better. Still lingering aftereffects from previous sexual failures. My question for you, reddit, is this: have you ever been in a relationship with someone who's different from you on so many levels? Did it work out? How? Follow-up question: Is there any advice you can give me on how to cope with this? Is there anything I should do to improve my lot with Suzy? Secondary follow-up question: What the fuck do I do at an EDM club? Seriously?! Is there an 'EDM For Dummies' lying around somewhere? Thanks. Even if I don't get a single response, this has been amazingly therapeutic to type out.Summary:
Summarize: So my (28M) friend is in a controlling abusive relationship with (22F). She doesn't like any of his friends and does everything in her power to keep him from hanging out with any of us. She will tell him she's cool with whatever plans at first, then day of comes and she makes him cancel. He's now bailed on three best friend birthday parties(one tonight), 13 dinner parties that we throw as a group twice a month, isn't allowed to come and hangout at any of our homes, and now isn't even allowed to text or call us. If he does go against her and go out, she will call him 100 times throughout the night to guilt him into going home. She did this on my birthday- she's been invited also to all of these events- and I ended up confiscating his phone for the evening so he could enjoy himself for once. Two weeks into their dating my bf, this friend and I went on a road trip to another province for two weeks we'd planned a year prior. She called him 100 times a day tryin to guilt him into coming home. She even booked a plane ticket to come join our trip but couldn't get a babysitter nor time off- thank god because that would've been awkward when she'd show up and we'd have no room for her in either the car or the three man tent we were using. Also she will trash talk him to anyone who'll listen. My bestie and I brought her out on girls night and she spent all night telling us how she's embarrassed by him, he has such a small dick, he's bad in bed.. Goes on and on. I should've recorded it and shown him. You can tell he is truly miserable, but thinks he loves her so he won't leave. How can we make him realize how unhappy he really is and how psycho she is?Summary:
Summarize: im a daily smoker, and i dont touch resin ever, not worth it. Butane poisoning would be best described from my end would be, headaches sick to my stomach all the time and i only noticed this would clear up when i detox to drop tolerance. Like i said been 2 months daily tokes just with the hemp wick and its been 100% success, havent felt sick since the first week. Even when the bowl gets to the black ash and has 1 hit in it left(shit hit) its not even haggard compared to that last hit with a lighter followed by choking up a storm from such a horrible tasteSummary:
Summarize: And I wanted to talk about it! Background: I live in Canada, I'm 22M, and this is (jackass!) a throwaway. I'm not particuarly gay and I read that anal has been more and more common among heterosexuals lately so I don't feel weird or anything about it and I always wanted to try it. I've always had a very low level of prudishness(?) and am willing to try pretty much anything at least once and wanted to share my experience with everyone, particularly other males who are considering anal but don't know what to expect. Not that I am an expert or anything, this was only my first time too. There was no partner involved, just some toys I ordered online. It took until now for me to realize that I'm an adult with my own apartment and credit card, and I can finally buy some toys to try out. My haul included: A 9" Blue Jelly Rubber Dildo ( which I found out after the fact was not the best choice, see here for details but my gag reflex was too strong, so that idea was out since I wasn't going to try it again after I'd used it anywhere but my mouth no matter how much I cleaned it. Up to that point I'd already loosened myself up gradually with other toys so that when I finally inserted this one, there was next to no discomfort in the penetration. I was surprised to find I could take all 9 inches up to the hilt on my very first time (is that normal?), and having all of it inside me was very satisfying. The only downside to this toy, besides learning later about the rubber thing, was that it had a very poor suction cup on its base, making mounting it on the wall or anything dificult, and no form of adhesive like tape will stick to it for very long. In the end I constructed a sort of holster out of tape folded in on itsself that the rubbery balls portion docks with and remains locked tightly. I hope I can find a pthalate-free alternative/replacement. If anyone has any suggestions, please share! A Generic Wireless Remote Vibrator . It has one speed and seven options for the rhythm. Pink and waterproof! It's starting speed was a bit strong at first, but became very enjoyable after I grew acclimated to it. A second hard plastic vibrator , this one long and thin. It has a dial for speed at the base and goes faster then anything else I bought. Stimulating! A Small (possibly jelly, I should double check that) Vibrating Buttplug . It wasn't very satisfying since at its widest it was still smaller then pretty much all the other toys I got, but still nice for getting used to having things inside me. **[An Aneros Helix]( This didn't really work all that well for me because I don't have very strong muscles down there. I was not able to clench or unclench very hard, long, or often enough to achieve any significant sensation, but I won't rule this out until I've had more practice with it. An intimidating clinical-looking metal thing called the Pure Wand (formerly Jupiter Wand.) I haven't actually tried this one yet but I've read nothing but positive reviews about it. If anyone here has one, please share your experiences with it. Hard Plastic Anal Beads . They're a weird wavy shape but I am eager to try them out soon. That concludes the penetrative purchases, other things I bought were a rubbery red cock ring (It's kind of tight but I think that's the point. I didn't particularly enjoy the feeling of all the blood trapped down there or seeing parts of me turn red, coupled with reading about the risks , and a pair of nipple suckers (black PVC cylinders with a sphere the size of a Mirabelle plum you compress to create suction. Hair gets in the way so its good to be clean shaved anywhere you plan on using them, but otherwise they offer a very strong suction feeling and rarely fall free.) Last but not least, bottles of a silicone-based lubricant , a water-based lubricant , and a toy cleaning disinfectant type deal ([which I am now having second thoughts about after reading this comment]( I found the silicone-based was not as lubricating as the water-based, but lasted much longer. Water-based was very slippery but required more and more often applicated to yield desireable results. As always, take care to avoid using silicone based lubricant in conjunction with silicone based toys. Kind of a lot for first time buying, right? In the end it came out to be about 200$, since a lot of it was on sale. The metal Pure Wand dealie is usually around 100$ on its own so I'm pretty happy with what I got. The only product I didn't get in this initial spree I was interested in was an inflatable buttplug. If anyone has any experience with these, please feel free to share! Enough stories from me though, I do have questions too, beyond the ones asking about the specifics of various toys I mentioned before! Most of all my biggest concerns are about keeping myself and my new toys clean, avoiding any common problems, infections, or injuries I as a newcomer may face (are there even common injuries?) and most of all, I'd like to hear about others experiences with toys and their recommendations of products I might consider in the future.Summary:
Summarize: I AM THE KING OF FISH PUNS Hey! I'm looking for someone to talk to when I get bored, but I want us to get along! Scratch that, I need what I used to have. Someone that I can talk to and actually be myself with. I'm not particularly looking for a relationship but I won't lie and say I'm not more than open to one. I like pink Floyd and shiny things (literally). I act like a dog sometimes because I'm weird, I like shopping at the mall with friends (with girls!! I'm straight). I have crazy dreams and I act weird so that's something that you have to handle :3 Regardless of all that I'm very smart. I won't hesitate to call anyone out on their bullshit. I offer constructive criticism that you may not like. I'll answer the phone at 3 am if you're upset.Summary:
Summarize: My girlfriend caught me staring at what seemed to be a girls ass at the bar. I had been waiting a long time to get the beer I was going to nurse for the rest of the night, In my boredom my eyes wandered, not lustfully, but curiously. I found myself staring at the tramp stamp of a princess jasmine costumed inseucurasaurus. One of my favorite movies was Aladin, because you know, there's nothing more inspiring than magic, princesses, and the notion that the only way to elevate oneself from poverty is finding a magic lamp. I have three wishes? Funny how that fantasy always follows the phrase "I want" not need but "want". I think the really hard part is trying to find the biggest hook to keep myself from realizing that i'm in an endless loop. The very fact that the Pronoun I is used seems to cement this argument with fallacy. That being said, can any logical thought that proceeds the word "I" be considered anything short of completely Narcissistic? I saw a girl dressed in a thin turquoise piece of fabric. The only thing left to the imagination was what she looked like before she started favoring hookups over sit-ups. I don't know if it was the one too many pity pounds packed on from that bad break up, you know, the one that that had her grazing the glazed donuts at the grocery, wishing the underachieving, pimple nosed cashier would paint her life 50 more or so shades of gray. , or the tramp stamp so subtly covering the entire bottom of her back, like a runway into the limitless depths of some abyss, She got my attention, but she was no princess. But she demanded attention, everything about it screamed "I'm important!" There's that I again, we all want things. Unfortunately I am not drunk enough to waste one of my wishes to portray myself as some prince, Quidich broom in hand, to sweep you off your feet and save you from the perils of the middle class! No, I would rather not focus on the things that beg for attention. I like jellyfish, there's one species in particular that's called the "immortal jellyfish" because it can perpetually revert back to its child state, and theoretically live for thousands of years. Jellyfish don't care about that though. Jellyfish just rides the tide, no room for I's me's my's or why's and it gets immortality. I just want this hangover to go away.Summary:
Summarize: I went on a cruise. I smuggled a handle on. got shit faced. went on a bar crawl , tried to steal beer from the bar. asked some 15 year old to dance, thank god she said no. shot one of those hocky puck things way to hard and the officer on duty came out to help me find it. I was too hung over to leave room for last two days of trip.Summary:
Summarize: Oh God. My time to shine. I had pined after this guy for a while. I finally got the nerve to talk to him when we both liked each other on Tinder and I revealed we had met before...once. A year ago. Somehow I didn't scare him away and we talked a few days, he invited me to his dorm for movies. I knew what was coming. I was prepared. So, he pops in a movie (Sweeney Todd, of all things) and then it's awkwardly quiet. Eventually I have to just grab his face, and things progress, and then... Well, the very first thing I thought of was those tiny pickles you see at salad bars. It couldn't have been more than 4". I carried on, gave him the most difficult head of my life will trying to gingerly work it with two fingers because I couldn't put my mouth on it if my hand was grabbing it because it didn't extend beyond my fist. After the most grueling 45 minute blowjob (I think I caught him singing along to Sweeney Todd during parts of it) he told me that I was the first girl to ever make him cum. I can only assume he had a wonky little sad penis.Summary:
Summarize: I think it depends on the game. Most games tend to be "one man armies". You, and possibly a handful of AI's as dumb as the enemies, are supposed to take down huge groups of people. Hundreds, or maybe even thousands of bad guys over the course of the game. If every encounter had you fighting a couple dozen enemies who spent 80% of their time in cover, it would just be tedious. One thing they could do is shrink the huge groups by making most of them run away, not just to the back of the map or something, but out of the battle entirely. It could potentially serve as a distraction for ruthless players (who insist on killing all the enemies no matter what) and possibly even a benefit to more observant players who take of the situation by attacking some the braver bad guys heckling the runaways. Alternatively, truly smart AI would be amazing in a series like Rainbow Six. Imagine a hostage situation, where a small group of enemies could lay traps, take cover, spread out or group up, all based on what you do; walk in front of a security camera, make too much noise on another floor, send your squad out or call them back. Based on the Vegas games, which are admittedly the only Rainbow Six games I've played, it's still the "3 guys take down tons of enemies room by room" formula. Since these are SUPPOSED to be tactical games, having few but smarter enemies would only add to the experience. Instead of using the door cam and marking off every enemy in the room, you might use it, see it's empty, only to find one guy hiding in the corner ready for you cause his buddy is upstairs watching you on a security camera. Then you reload the checkpoint, go in the other door but hes not there this time.Summary:
Summarize: Men in western culture are attracted to boobs basically because society tells us they're attractive. Even from a young age guys are bombarded with media and observation that shows breasts as sexual objects. As for how they were considered sexual in the first place, its because we go to such great lengths to cover them up. In societies where breasts are completely exposed, they're not considered sexual. In some African cultures that expose breasts, men consider thighs to be sexual because they are covered up. In strict Islamic societies, ankles, as well as other female parts, are considered obscene because they go to great lengths to cover them up. When a culture demands that women cover up some part of their body, men associate it as a forbidden fruit of the female anatomy. In nudists communities, simply walking around naked is not considered sexual, because everyone is just desensitized to it.Summary:
Summarize: I used to travel back and forth from campus to home every couple of months, ~300 miles, to see my parents and spend the weekend. One trip I came down and got into a huge fight with my mom over my ferret, because it had fleas she didn't want it in her house and it was too cold to leave in my car. Anyway in a haze of pissitivity I decided to just go back to my campus that night having nowhere else to stay. I knew I was too tired to make it so I grabbed a monster energy drink, a pack of No-Doz, and a 20oz coke to keep me going. Killed the monster, the coke, and I don't remember how many No-Doz but I knew it was too many. After about 3 or 4 hours on the road it really started to hit. I could feel my heart-beat, I had a cold sweat all over, and just felt like complete shit. I pulled over on some random country road because I realized I was lost. Threw up a couple of times, got back in my car and my body shut down, couldn't sleep but I had no will to move either. Had to call my girlfriend and my roommate to come get me and after getting home spent most of the day laying in a bath tub with full body shivers and twitches just riding it out.Summary:
Summarize: How about we start with damaging the relationship with the people who were willing to vouch for her (who also happen to be related to a friend), followed by lying to a landlord she may be relying on in the future for a good reference? She is currently very dependant on these people for stable housing, it seems unwise to be pulling shit like this with them. OP, just get your sister to explain to these people that she needs a bit of time to find a place where Ziggy is welcome. Worst case pay for some boarding or temporary foster care. Just find a place where she and the Zigster are both welcome and where his presence isn't going to cause conflict. Lying to get her way may seem convenient but people around her may catch on. People will treat her very differently after that.Summary:
Summarize: I am currently in college after graduating high school a few months ago. I am not a dumb person. Up until the end of sophomore year of high school, I was always one of the smarter kids in class. I learned easily and gave a shit. I got mostly A's and some B's and occasionally a C. Towards the end of my sophomore year, I started to become a slacker and stopped giving as much of a shit. I wasn't as motivated and my outlook on school negated more and more as time went on. I got a C- in math because I hated it and it made me feel like shit every day because I refused to pay attention for some reason. Junior year, I basically failed Pre-Calculus (well, my teacher passed me with a D) both semesters, I was failing Chemistry at one point second semester (I was planning on dropping it, so I didn't try, but they ended up not letting me) and I didn't read my books on time in English. Senior year, I still don't give a shit and don't pay much attention in class, but it doesn't really matter that much because my schedule was easy and I didn't reallt have to try that hard. Now I'm in college, like I said, and I still have a shitty work ethic. I don't want to put effort into subjects I don't care about/have no interest in. I was supposed to read a chapter out of my anthropology book, which I'm not going to do because maybe we really won't have to ( yeah yeah yeah ...) and I really don't want to. I am dropping my stats class tomorrow because I don't want to go through math class again because it drives me insane and frustrated the shit out of me when I get behind (which is because I don't pay attention). I am aware that I sound like a complete loser, but that's how I feel. I can't seem to get it through my thick skull that I need to succeed at this. Maybe it's because I don't have an end goal (I don't know what I want to pursue for sure). Is all this normal? How do I get motivated and give a shit? Do I have ADD? Do I need adderall? Is college not for me?Summary:
Summarize: Could there be a difference in the "fuck"? Perhaps one can gain and give away a "social fuck"- empathy, sympathy, etc to others.. while one's "self fuck(s)" can be either only dispensed toward oneself.. or may be transferable when really wanting to allot a "fuck" to someone else.. As far as I know, you can see when someone gives a "fuck" in your situations. Perhaps, you should make A concerted effort to disperse your "self fucks to send them to someone else..Summary:
Summarize: Quite a difficult one. For me it's impossible to pin down a 'BRAVE moment', I cherish so many memories form my time in Brave. Although it's interesting to see how what you appreciate as a player evolves over time. My most endearing memories of Rahadalon are newbie to the core. Getting on my first killmail with a Merlin, seeing my first titan (a PL Avatar) in Nakah, Kill: Motre (Revelation), Asking if it's worth fitting guns to suicide tackle , going into a WH for the first time and having Andrew Jester lose half the fleet, 'need people on the Mendori gate there's freighter coming through', the RvB war, helping found Brave dojo with Hail Sagan, getting my first T2 ship - a hound - for ratting battleships in curse... the list is endless. These are not things I would wish to repeat, but I enjoyed greatly at the time. In Barleguet I feel that I actually 'learned how to play', with most experiences being something I can relate to today. The endless POS bashing with LePetite ]( discovering the joys of POS reactions with some friends, joining my first social channels (most of which I'm still in today), calling 'Blue ICe is primary' whilst FCing an anti-leadership fleet on Kennick sun, lighting a cyno so that we could kill SNUFF dreads that dropped on NOC's carrier camp, flying an unkillable Scorpion in Megaladon fleets that [still has a top place on my killboard years later]( [getting my first capital ship]( becoming 'space middle class' [via DED sites]( and starting to PLEX my accounts for the first time... Again, not things I would necessarily like to repeat, but are fond memories nonetheless. Sendaya/Catch was different. Aside from the [extremely fun deployment speculation]( I went in smugly ahead of everyone else, personally deploying with a few cap pilots in suitcase carriers half a day before the announcement was made. Which pretty much defined my Catch experience in a nushell. For the first time I was 'at the top' of the corp in terms of experience and SP, newbie frigates roams didn't interest me, they exasperated me. That's not to say Catch wasn't fun, I just felt that the majority of Brave 'ideals' were conflicting with my own. [Skynetting inties in V-3]( [Watching the hilarious conclusion to Fanfest '14 together on comms]( dropping for the first time with Brave caps to help set timers, almost losing my archon as Levi Scutter forgets to bring warp core stabs in his Nid, [becoming the alliance mogul on DED sites]( [enjoying Brave first T2 cruiser fleets]( having some of the most fun I've had in Eve piloting an Onyx in said fleets, etc etc. Of course, [Catch is where I left Brave]( for the reasons I put in that post. I'll always enjoy helping people in Brave Dojo and chatting to friends made during my time in corp, but I just feel that Brave as an alliance is no longer for me. Also fuck that got preachy. Sorry.Summary:
Summarize: Wow, you just described my own situation, give or take some of the details. The thing that kills me about my gf is that she's really a great girl--there's nothing about her that seriously annoys me, worries me, etc. I'm just not excited to be in this relationship at all anymore. I've been feeling this way for months, but can't seem to muster up the courage to actually break it off because I feel like I don't have a good reason. I hope you figure things out sooner than it's taking me.Summary:
Summarize: I had broken up with my ex a few weeks prior to this event. So anyway, I ended up at this party and got completely hammered, the ex was also there and tells me how her brother wants to beat my ass down, her brother was a big buff guy of age 19, when I was 16. I was feeling ballsy and dared her to call him and thought nothing of it for the rest of the party. End up having too much to drink, vomiting in the toilet, and the big brother at the door of the bathroom, I get up from my vomit-induced stupor and shake his hand with the hand I just used to force myself to vomit and apologised profusely to him (for no reason, I guess I go from ballsy to apologetic when I get super super drunk). He looked extremely confused and simply said ''It's alright :)'' with a smile just like that and left (he came to pick up my ex and beat me up)Summary:
Summarize: It's Sunday night. Hubby and I are chilling on the couch, watching Blacklist. The only sounds are coming from the TV in this room, and (faintly) the dryer in the laundry room. In about 10 minutes, hubby is going to put his head on my lap because that's how he likes to watch movies late at night. I love nights like this. I wouldn't trade in spending time with this amazing guy for a crying, needy small human, and idk why anyone who has bingoed me believes my current arrangement needs to be "improved"Summary:
Summarize: Little bit long but this story means the world to me, had to share with my Ents...I am on cloud right now. On Friday, I had my final interview with a big investment bank in NYC (obviously can't name them). It's my dream job to work on Wall Street and I was shocked I had made it so far with so much other talent vying for the spot. I had to pay for college myself, and I didn't go to the best school but I worked my ass off and focused on getting good grades. The last round of interviews took place with the head of HR. Typical business type: serious attitude, expects a lot of the employees and takes no shit. I was so nervous that I was gonna say something stupid and f*ck up my chances. And that's exactly what I did...or so I thought. After the usual questions about why I want the position, Mr. HR man throws me a real curveball- "What do you like to do to relax?". Instantly, my mind goes to that fat 2 gram J that's waiting for me in the car (was planning on celebrating if things went well). I froze for a second and stammered a bit, and Mr. HR took advantage of me being caught off guard. To my complete horror the worst words I could imagine came out of his mouth: "You like to smoke weed son?". I nearly shit myself and all the color left my face. I saw my whole future flash before my eyes, all the dreams and hopes that I had carried with me for so long vanished. I sat there for what seemed like 5 years, until I could finally blurt out that I had never touched drugs but he put his hand up with the fire of a thousand suns in his eyes. I thought for sure he was going to throw me out of his office right there. We're sitting in silence, me completely devastated that I had thrown away the best job opportunity ever, and him looking like he could kill me on the spot. Then, out of nowhere, he starts laughing his ass off. I'm still completely frozen I have no idea what to do. He tells me I'm an excellent candidate, and that if I smoke weed I should fit in just fine around here. He offered me the job right on the spot, and next thing I know I'm sitting in my car unable to believe what just happened to me. I drove home and roasted this fat doob in celebration (and to make my heart stop racing). Thinking of you ents! I hope y'all have as awesome a day as I did!Summary:
Summarize: The word "neckbeard" is not nearly as offensive as "slut" or "cunt", and by no means is "fattie" used to discriminate mainly against males. See [this thread]( for some lovely examples. At the time of posting, [this comment]( has 963 points. Obviously I agree with the principles of gender equality, but to suggest that men face the same issues as women online is entirely ridiculous. For example, every time a woman posts a picture of something where she just so happens to appear in the picture , that ridiculous image of "men vs women posting a photo of something" is inevitably the top comment. Every time a photo of an [attractive woman]( is posted, it's upvoted to the heavens and the top comments [are]( [always]( [creepy]( [as]( [shit]( Face it, reddit is a horrible place to be if you're a minority.Summary:
Summarize: I know what you mean. The last thing I want to do while driving is listen to shitty music on the radio. I don't want to wade in amongst the adds, radio "personalities", and teeny-bopper bullshit that passes as mainstream music these days, praying that the next song that receives airtime, just before I arrive at my destination, is something that I'll like. The main complaints in this thread is how people don't like the music being played by JJJ at the moment and how it was better when they played music you liked. WELL GO FUCK YOURSELF. If there is a certain type of music you like listening to, then go buy/download the albums of your favourite band and stop crying about it. In this day and age when everyone seems to have a device that'll play an mp3, I have no idea why you would bother with the radio. Hate the presenters? Go download a podcast. Hate Aussie Hip Hop? Download the music you actually like. It's not rocket surgery; it's common-fucking-sense.Summary:
Summarize: I want to let people know that it is not worth blowing all your money levelling blacksmithing or jewel-crafting. Jewel-crafting. To put it simply, crafting jewels is currently not worth the cost simply because the ones you are crafting drop in nightmare/hell/inferno so you are just wasting money. Since jewels can be removed from sockets, invest in buying 4-10 gems that are high level use them for your gear. To build on this gems don't have level requirements you may as well buy radiant quality (or close to) gems and use them for everything. Blacksmithing The cost to craft items is simply too much. It is not currently worth it to spend money crafting with the risk of the items stats being bad. Sure you could craft 4-5 items and eventually get a good one, by that time you have spent 100k gold which could be used to by extremely good items.Summary:
Summarize: I try to login and get this I'm fairly certain it's because I messaged someone their phone number... I did this because he was consistently harrassing me about ddosing my friends and calling my friend racial slurs. I have proof if that's needed but I feel like messaging someone his own phone number shouldn't be a pernament ban, especially under these circumstances. So how do I go about being unbanned? (Once again, I have proof of his messages via Minecraft's built in chat logs)Summary:
Summarize: Hi. First time posting on reddit. First of all, I'm sorry for the grammar and mispells, english isn't my native language. And sorry if I make any mistake. So, I met this girl in 2010. We were kids, basically(13 years old, both of us). We were close to each other, she liked books, I liked books, we had some interests in common. I'll just try to summarize everything. In 2011, I fell in love with her. I had never fallen in love with someone the way I fell with her. So I told her, and we started a relationship(yes, we had 15 years old, I know, some will say it's nothing important). At first, she was with me just to forget a boy she had been having feelings for, but after some months, she truly started to love me. So we got very close. She had very serious self-esteem problems and I was the person that helped her the most. Some would say she's fat; I say she's perfect. I just love her, you know? The point is, we were really, really close to each other. We spent all day long talking to each other, and every weekend, we would go out to see movies. Thing is, in the end of 2013, I got some doubts about my feelings. It wasn't the first time, and she noticed it. So she broke up with me, wanting to give me time to think about my love for her. I ended up not wanting to get back with her, when she came to talk to me again after 2 months(February 2014). It's the biggest regret I have. Really, the thing that I want the most is just to go back in time and not let her go away. It was really bad for her, but she had her friends and her family, and she travelled to a foreign country, so thinking about me wasn't something she would do all the time. So, after 4 months of our breakup(April, 2014), she searched me again, wanting a "friend with benefits" type of relationship. Yes, we had had sexual activities. Nothing really serious, two young persons knowing each other. So I accepted because... I liked to be with her. And I ended up falling in love with her again, and she still loved me, so we got back together. And I thought that this time it was serious. Wasn't. I mean, it was serious. But just not as strong as before. She started to get distant. I always had to search for her, she almost never looked for me. Watching her TV series seemed to be more important for her than I was. She wouldn't charge her cellphone, so I couldn't talk with her. I'm very possessive, I admit. I don't like to stay one day without talking with her; it just makes me nervous. I don't know. So, I felt like I was loving her, but she wasn't loving me back. She kept telling me that she did love me, she was just different. And I believed her. I thought that I just had to get used to not getting so much attention. Two weaks ago, she broke up with me. One day before our last year of school began. It wasn't a agressive breakup, because I understood her point. She still loves me, and I know it. Our connection is really strong. But she loves me as a friend. Something like that. Aaand, she felt feelings for the boy that she was trying to forget when we started dating. So... I really wouldn't like to be with her knowing she liked another guy. I'm trying to move on. But I still love her. Like, I really don't have any will to live without her. I totally understand we HAD to breakup, things weren't working out. But I miss her. And I'm young, and I know I have a lot to live. Still... It's hard, without her. It's really hard to wake up, knowing I won't have her with me. And I see her everyday, because of school. And what kills me is that she's fine. She's moving on. In some time, she will probably know another guy. And I wont be the last anymore. She's fine, and i'm just... I don't have a place to go. I don't have anyone to talk to. I'm just alone. Loneliness is killing me. And I feel it's my fault. If I hadn't broken up with her the first time, if I could just love her and stop being stupid, things would the fine now. She would still love me. I really don't know if I made it clear to you what the situation was. I'm sorry, i'm really confused too... Thank you for reading.Summary:
Summarize: Religion is only part of the answer. Syria was originally a province of the Ottoman empire, which then passed to the french as the Ottomans lost WW1. France then lost Syria after being occupied in WW2, it passed through the hands of the Brits, and eventually became an independent country. The young Syrian republic was ruled by a series of short and violent governments until the Baath party came into power in the 60s. The Baath party believes in strict authoritarian rule and the separation of religion and state power, so it suppresses political religious movements. The US and other western allies found Baath parties useful in keeping the region stable through the cold war, which is why both Assad and Saddam enjoyed support from the US for a long time. Fast-forward to 2012, and people are kind of fed up with this authoritarian shit. Democracy has spread to many former dictatorships in other parts of the world. Several Arab countries start to successfully depose decade-old authoritarian rulers with the support of the West, and begin to experiment with democracy. Some have fared better than others. Since Baathist dictators suppressed religious political movements for decades, these came back with a vengeance and established themselves as major political forces rather quickly. First, you have to stop thinking about Syria as a homogenous population of crazy religious people. That's like saying that all Americans are bible-thumping nuts. There are regular people who want peace and good government above all else, and think maybe democracy will give them some more voice in it, and there are your religious extremists who want to solve everything with faith. They aren't many, but they are loud and motivated. Syria had a revolution where large parts of civil society and the army revolted agaisnt Assad, the ruling dictator, claiming the right to hold elections. However, they did not receive support from the West like they thought they would, as Russia is a major ally and arms seller to Assad and it used it's security council veto power to block any international restrictions on Assad's heavy weaponry. Being free to deploy cruise missiles, air forces, and even chemical weapons for a while, Assad managed to grind a rather large revolution into a bloody stalemate. While this bloody war dragged on, political islamism made it's usual comeback, this time as a military force, becoming an undefined third party whose aims did not entirely align with the original revolutionaries, but whose common enemy in the Baath government made them unwilling allies. The original rebels fought for free elections, something the islamists do not care particularly about. Enter then the former Iraqi outfit called ISIS (who you should call Daesh), whose military experience and promise of a new islamic state that transcended old colonial borders unites the islamist factions and starts to form an islamic state (or Calipahte) encompassing both Syria and Iraq.Summary:
Summarize: When I was in high school, some friends and I started a forest fire. We were lighting firecrackers and tossing them off a 200m bridge near where we lived. Eventually someone tossed a "spinner" firecracker, but instead of lighting up and spinning, the tiny ember of the wick just fell down into the darkness. We peered over the railing of the bridge and saw nothing. Then, out of the darkness, we heard the "fffffttt" sound of the firecracker lighting up. In a panic, we jumped back, shared some mutual expressions of profanity, and then decided to look over the railing once more. In the few intervening seconds a small blaze had formed. We panicked and RAN LIKE HELL - one friend tearing his knee open on a piece of barb wire at some point in the escape. We drove to the nearest payphone and called 911, quickly said that someone had started a fire under the bridge, and then booked it home. Luckily for us they still had payphones back then. The next day we went back out to see if everything was ok. It was not. Throughout the night the fire had burned and a massive amount (read: acres) of the riverbed was charred and black on one side. I came back several years later and there was still some evidence of the fire. In all honesty, I'm surprised it wasn't worse.Summary:

I've been trying to sit upright with good posture lately; however, by mid-late day, I experience upper-back/shoulder blade pain. I also notice this over time when I try walking with good posture.

Summarize: While the changes also seem a bit excessive to me, I think the intentions are good(Plat 2 ADC main and I FUCKING HATE PANTHEON). Its in line with how they are treating long range ults as a whole(TF, Noc etc.). The problem is 100% the lack of counter play to Pantheons post 6 play. It just too face roll to press R from across the map and double kill bot lane. I think they should remove all changes except the ult range. This will allow lanes to ward appropriately to prevent him from ganking, but still allow him to punish lanes that don't invest the resources in vision.Summary:
Summarize: I've been playing EU TERA for awhile (I'm Spaniard and live in Spain) until I couldn't play more for various reasons. Now that I want to come back (since a few weeks ago actually) I've been trying to find with no luck a way to purchase an activation code for Tera US... since I would want to avoid Failforge this time. It just seems impossible to find a digital version of this game for the NA servers... sure I can buy a boxed copy on Amazon which is at 17$ for Standard or 33$ for the Collectors, which are very good prices... if I were in the US. Shipping is not only a bit expensive but it will take a while too. It's just too easy to find any EU key and activate it... I've got the Collector's edition back when I first started playing, and thought it could be that easy for the NA version too... but nope.Summary:
Summarize: None is always the safe bet. No guy has ever complained about a shaved vagina. Some guys "don't mind" pubic hair, but a lot do. Depends on the girl, and on the guy's preferences. Personally, I like skinny girls with nice butts. The size of a girl's boobs don't matter as much as women think it does. We just like boobs. Don't try to be "one of the guys." Guys hate that. It's really cool if you like sports, but don't burp and fart and make dick jokes. We have our friends for that. We just want to put our wieners in them... we don't care much what they look like. It's not like we go back to our friends like "That girl had the sexiest vagina ever!" (Unless it was really amazingly perfect.) SoSummary:
Summarize: Hey ladies! Oh my gosh, I just HAVE to share that I've been dating such a wonderful woman. We had our first date in early July. She's amazing. They say you "just know." On that first date, sitting across from her at an ice cream shop, I realized that we had an amazing connection. Like, a heart and soul sort of thing, [Emersonian over-soul.]( For our second date, we went to the botanic gardens. Seven hours passed in like, no time at all. Bonus: very atypical rains (it hardly EVER rains in Colorado, really) kept us "trapped" under a beautiful gazebo for a long time. I'm just totally smitten, and wonder how I could have gotten so lucky. And ring the heck outta the sex gong for me!! Yeahhhhhh! EDIT: No, we did not have public sex under a gazebo. Heh. In my excitement to post this, I realized it could be misconstrued.Summary:
Summarize: Hello... This is my first time posting anything, and mostly I just wanted to vent, maybe get some perspective. I'm 23 years old and for the last year I have just been working and taking a break from school. I want to start up again (but at a different university, since I've moved) but I'm afraid that I've forgotten how everything works and all that jazz. I've submitted transfer applications, applied for government aid and all, but I doubt I'll be ready to start in the Spring 2013 semester. My list of fears for going back to school: 1) That I'll be too afraid to actually commit and I'll keep putting it off semester by semester. 2) That I won't be able to afford it. I can't quit my job -- obviously -- since I have people depending on my paycheck to help pay a chunk of the household utilitles. I have some government loans already from the first 4 years of school (which have gone into repayment) 3) That I'll fail...again. My first time through, I did well the first 3 years. Started off making As and Bs, then dropped to averaging Cs for a good 2 years, then the last semester and a half I completely dropped the ball, nothing but Ds and Fs -__- I know it was entirely my fault. I lost focus, freaked myself out on not having figure out what I wanted to major in when I was technically a Junior.Summary:
Summarize: Like many others have said already, its about quality of life. My family has a history of obesity coupled with bad health. We have got diabetes, sleep apnea, joints giving out and needing replacement, heart disease, etc, etc. Pretty much all health problems caused by being obese is in my family history. That's why i care about being fit. I don't want to live with diabetes. I don't want to die before my children reach adulthood. I want to run and play with my kids. I want to be able to take them to Disneyland without complaining that i can't walk that much. Sure obese people will die same as fit people. But statistics say they will die sooner then fit people. Statistics say they will suffer many more health problems then fit people. That's why.Summary:

Macro, Micro, Everything is completely APM reliant.

Summarize: I've been on both. I loathe methadose/methadone, but right now for some stupid, unknown reason, it's working much, much better at controlling the cravings etc. Some time back - I think up until October - I had been on Subs for about 6ish months, and they were doing nothing but keeping me not-sick, and it was awful. I ended up just stockpiling my pills and going back to using down full time. Normally, I'm all about the bupe. I find it amazing in every possible way - even coming off the stuff. It's still rough, but less than half the amount of time as coming off juice, and I don't feel anything other than 'normal' while I'm on it. This time though, it just didn't work for me. Within the next few months, I have every intention of transitioning back onto them. I'm at 6.5mg of methadose (6.5=65 in methadone) and it has me so fucking tired and spacey all the time; it's starting to affect my jobs, which is bull, because they're the first jobs I've had in nearly 7 bloody years and I really, really like them. Sorry... that got a personal.Summary:
Summarize: Hi Reddit, First post here so I hope I do everything right. I should make a quick note that he only does the physical abuse when he's angry. In the beginning, our relationship was great, nothing was wrong and we go along like any happy couple. I'd say the verbal abuse started around 6 months ago, this is when he'd shout right at me and shout every bad name under the sun at me when something has upset him...he's admitted that nearly every time wasn't my fault he was angry but I was the only person there to take it out on? Next came the physically abuse, this started about 2-3 months ago. First it was little things like pinning me down or shoving me out of the way but it has quickly progressed to physically grabbing me hard, screaming in my face, head butting me hard several times, kicking me in the stomach and grabbing and even pulling out my hair. This abuse leaves me with many bruises and black eyes. The next day, I don't know how he's going to act. He could be really apologetic and ashamed of what he's done or he could be really cold, distant, refusing to apologise and even blaming me for what he's done. Now the emotional abuse, everything always is my fault no matter what. If I'm feeling down or sad for some reason, he'll make me feel guilty for being sad, twist it round on him so he can feel sad so I have to forget about my feelings and care about him. He'll also play mind games with me such as getting a laugh out of making me cry, laugh at me and then patronisingly tap me on the back saying it will be okay. In the past he's said things including "You're a pile of shit" " I don't owe you anything" "I hope you get run over" and even going as far as saying " if you don't move out the way, I'll grab you and put you in the traffic". He always tells me my feelings and opinions are wrong and he's right. It's really breaking me down slowly, yes I love this guy and yes I want to help him but there's only so much a person can take. It seems like he can do whatever he wants to me and I am expected to forgive him but I do the slightest thing wrong (which can include spilling a drop of water on the floor) he'll continue to "punish" me until I'm literally begging him to stop. This punishment includes neglecting any form of physical contact, doesn't care or notice how I feel, and doesn't show any empathy regardless how much I'll apologise and beg. I hate being ignored so obviously he does this to upset me even more. When I'm upset, usually about something he's done to me he tells me to deal with my problems myself, he doesn't want to be there or help me and that I should grow up without even a hug or kiss. When he's upset me, I'll do whatever I can to get it back to normal which includes apologising, making him food and cakes and just overall being nice even though he doesn't deserve it and it's because I'm scared of him. When he's angry at me and taking it out on me, I'll let him and try to calm him down because I hate seeing him upset. The one occasion that really upset me is that my grandad recently passed away and it was a really hard day for me, I admit I was emotional and slightly grouchy but he can't deal with that. He twisted it round, made the whole day about him and acted like my feelings didn't even matter. Yep, on the day of my grand dads funeral, he got violent with me and made me feel even worse about myself. One day he can be the nicest person ever, being really nice to me, buying me presents, hugging me, wanting to get close and overall being an amazing boyfriend that I know he is deep down. But other days he can be completely different by getting violent, getting moody, being distant, cold and uncaring and it's frustrating trying to adapt my mood and my feelings to his personality that day. This relationship really is destroying everything I've got. It's destroyed my confidence, self worth and overall made me feel nothing more than a walking skeleton. I feel so broken, now when he gets angry I just apologise straight away because no matter what I say it will always be my fault. I should mention that we do live together and he's got quite a stressful job. Please help me reddit, what can I do to help him?Summary:

Summarize: The Elder Scrolls games are all single player RPGs centred around the player character... They're very much about you exploring the world on your own and discovering things while being immersed in said world, feeling like you are the first player to have done so... Not to mention your growth into being the most powerful individual around capable of fucking up everyone else's shit. That does not translate at all into an MMO by virtue of the fact that now you've got thousands of player characters running around. The exploration aspect is watered down because you're not the only player character in the world to discover it, and then everyone else is equally growing in power, so you no longer have that aspect of uniquely being this powerful motherfucker unmatched by anyone else.Summary:

She's not computer illiterate, but she can't grasp some of the fundamentals (like unzipping files, locating stuff on her computer, many of the terms [FTP for a start]) so all the online tutorials she's tried to follow have gone over her head. She tried hiring a techie to get her going, but that person took her money and ran, so now she's reluctant to give hired help another chance. I'm not much help because my site-building expertise doesn't extend far beyond basic HTML and a smattering of CSS. What resource(s) can I point her to?

Now this may sound simply RETARDED, but I love south park. They always have a message behind a lot of their episodes. The recent one got me thinking, I mean.. all the votes weren't even finished counting, and they gave him the presidency. Am I just taking this too far? I feel like the way the world is nowadays, no one even cares that there could be voter fraud. I don't mean to again, sound retarded or get you guys all riled up over a south park episode. But it made me think. Both candidates weren't that great, and honestly it could be a puppet show, but I feel Romney got shafted. What if the only conspiracy here is on the Obama side, and Romney was hit so hard from the media out of context, he could have actually SAVED the country? I mean, he wanted to get tough on China, which obviously they wouldn't like.. I don't know guys, it just got me thinking. Nothing really adds up to me. Thoughts?Summary:
Summarize: That was my life a few years ago, except I was getting grief from both of my parents. It got to the point that I agreed to go on a blind date set up by them. Now, don't get me wrong. I love both of my parents, but I knew from the beginning that this blind date would end in disaster. Sure enough, that's exactly what happened, and by the end, they regretted having set me up on the blind date in first place.

They've never seriously bothered me about my dating life since.Summary:
Summarize: I've been depressed my entire life, and I'm currently in a very shit spot where everything is joyless and I don't give a fuck about anything. I wrote a longer post about things here: Normally I stay awake half the night with anxiety and other thoughts/worries, but now I haven't slept at all for two days. This is the second day I've taken off work without calling in, and I'm trying to get myself back to the point of going in and facing the music. I don't care if I get canned or not, but I realize that doing so would be bad for me and the people I work with (primarily my dad). I've been coping by using alcohol for years, and I'm seriously concerned it's going to kill me. Since the beginning of the year I've been getting drunk almost every night and it's butchering my bank account. However, it's the only thing (other than drugs) that lets me feel other emotions and gives me a way to not give a fuck about everything I'm procrastinating on. It lets me feel numb about how I'm letting myself and everyone else down. I need other alternatives. I've seen a counselor but talking hasn't really helped, and the last antidepressant I was on was Effexor which did nothing, even though the side/withdrawal effects were totally fucked. I can identify self-defeating or self-destructive behaviour, but I having serious problems stopping or preventing it. I don't want to die. What else can I do?Summary:
Summarize: My father is Pine Ridge, which doesn't mean much, but if anyone is interested how a Lakota not on the rez feels, I don't understand blaming alcohol manufacturers and distributors for alcoholism on the rez. It's baffling. It's the same on Rosebud, too. They have far bigger problems on Pine Ridge, and they need to put effort into those, imo, first. From elder abuse, tribal government stealing from the tribe instead of putting money into social programs, [the impeachment of the first woman president of the tribe]( because she tried to keep abortion legal and safe in a time when South Dakota tried to pass laws making abortion illegal even for incest, to child abuse and teen pregnancy rates... However, make no mistake, they are living in a third world country, and it is because of the broken treaties , lies, manipulation and blatantly illegal treatment of Natives on the reservation, by the government and the people surrounding the rez, that accounts for their current state. You may not personally feel responsible for their state, but [your country sure as hell is]( and can change the situation, and chooses not to. [You can make a stand for their treatment, and you choose not to.]( That's your choice, of course to not feel any responsibility to empathy for people living this way in America, but don't think things are the way they are and cannot change. They are the way they are because the Natives played by rules Western Civilization doesn't respect, and that lack of respect might be our undoing. They didn't "lose" because they were stupid or weak. And it's no coincidence that the tribe that would be the richest in the nation if laws and treaties were followed and they were still in possession of the Black Hills, is the poorest and weakest in the nation today. If you'd like more information about how Pine Ridge came to be the way it is, about the broken treaties, the laws the government breaks to this day to keep them in check and in poverty, and you're too lazy to find it on your own, I'll point you in the right direction.

Summarize: I saw the second one recently and was extremely disappointed, I skipped through some of it because the dialogue was just so so bad, I understand that it's a kind of mick take of action films, but pretty much most lines are cliché 'action film dialogue'. And some of the throw backs to previous films are down right fucking terrible, one that comes to mind is when Arnie states for the 100th time- 'I'll be back', Bruce Willis retorts 'you've been back enough, I'll be back '- that's not too awful, but then Arnie follows it with something ridiculous like 'yeesh yippee ki yay'. I was just shocked at how far it fell from the first one which had some genuinely entertaining dialogue moments- as well as a more interesting story.Summary:
Summarize: Have an extra room available for next year? Want to fill it with a pretty awesome dude? Then I'm your man! I'm a second year Aerospace Engineering student looking for some people to live with next year! Some stuff about me: I lived in PCV this year, but have come to the conclusion that it kinda sucks ass, and I want to live in a house next year! Super Important fact one: I love cooking. I can make a mean grapefruit teriyaki chicken stir fry. Not your thing? Thats okay, I can make you some bomb pasta casserole or maybe some awesome marinated steaks! I also like video games, any type! Want someone to stroll through the glorious land of skyrim with? Or shoot some noobs on BF3? I'm down! Want a roommate who isn't loud and obnoxious so you can get your work done? Perfect! I can even help you with your math homework! Well, unless your a math major. Then I might not be so much help. That all probably made me sound like a lazy nerd. Not true! (Well, at least not the lazy part). I love going to the gym and running! We can even go backpacking and rock climbing! I love that shit! Some big stuff I can bring: kick ass sound system. Like ridiculous level. We can listen to some sick dubstep and techno on it. Classic rock is good too. I'll bring a xbox, desktop computer, laptop, wireless router, and a bunch of kitchen stuff. Oh, also really important: I'm not a slob. I do my dishes right after I make them. I clean things up, and wont make a mess. I don't mess with other people's stuff either. If it's not mine, I won't touch it. Send me a message, or email me at osnofla9@gmail.com. I can send you my fb and we can meet up sometime!Summary:
Summarize: Agreed. I still use Comcast for Internet and yes, a landline phone which is connected to my modem. I use this because I have horrible cell service in my house. With two small children, this was a must for my family. Anyway, I cut the chord to cable TV over a year ago, we save almost $80 a month. The key to an easy dealing with this company IS TO GO AND TALK TO SOMEONE FACE TO FACE. Old school, no phones, no internet, no assholes putting you on hold. The ladies, almost always nice older ladies, are phenomenal at my local represenation of Comcast and I have heard the same about other locations. Just suck it up, take the time, and go see a human being that will confirm, sign, and give you the necessary paperwork and receipts right then and there. Our world has become depedendant on things that are useless when we still have mouths that work when talking to someone face to face. The stories of people being on hold forever, getting hung up on etc...they make me laugh and it is always some young idiot that forgets that they can walk, ride, or fly to a comcast office....get a grip and take care of business!! Don't depend on others to do the job they are supposed to do, do it yourself! Finally, I am against Comcast for all they are doing, trying to do, and what they have done with their TV options...but I have no choice in using them as an ISP..hoping that will change in the near future.Summary:
Summarize: Flush your eye out with water (or get eyewash from the drug store). Go see the doctor, since it could just be crap in your eyes, or it could be a detached retina. Way too many things.Summary:
Summarize: I'll never see any real reward for my work. I don't like women, so I'm never getting married or having a family of my mine. Literally nothing I accomplish will ever mean anything to anyone. In 50 years, everyone who knows me will likely be dead. Thus, I see zero reason to put myself through the bullshit of 'making something of myself', or 'earning a living' or whatever other bullshit society says I'm 'supposed' to do. So, I'm probably going to kill myself. Society can burn in hell. People are free to believe in the bullshit notion that hard work is meaningful and that you have to work to live. At the same time, I'm free to choose to kill myself, and there's not a damn thing anyone can do about it.Summary:
Summarize: I feel like I never grew out of that angsty teenage phase and I'm frusrated and full of guilt. I can't seem to hold a proper conversation with my parents without feeling angry/irritated that they are asking too many questions, judging my decisions, doubting me, etc. I know it's all very juvenille, but it's an extremely intense feeling that I can't seem to ignore and most conversations deteriorate into arguements . Even the most benign conversations are impossible. Admittedly, I have been quite disrespectful to my parents on many occasions and made them feel quite terrible. I think the word that best describes it is that there is a fury (to quote James Frey's A Million Little Pieces) when I have to interact with them. I'm not nearly as messed up as the character in that book, but like the book, my parents never really did anything in particular to harm me, though I am quite resentful from childhood. The fury is something that I feel physically too (light a tightness in the head and chest) and it's nearly impossible to overcome. I thought I would grow out of it after leaving for university and moving out of the family home. However, I still live close to them and they insist on seeing me every week or so. I really just don't enjoy it and I avoid calling them or seeing them until I just feel bad about not being a shitty daughter. My parents have their own crap going on too and expect me to mediate/console and are pretty good at making me feel guilty when I refuse to take on the role. I'm accused of not caring and wanting to disown them, but I do. It's just that I can only take them in small doses. I tell them that if I saw them less often, I would be more pleasant, but they can't understand or accept this. I'm angry at myself, I'm angry at them, and I just don't know what to do anymore. I find it hard to admit all this as I'm embarassed to be such a disrespectful and ungrateful daughter. Am I alone in feeling this way? How can I overcome this?Summary:
Summarize: I just spent far too much time there. I didn't see any real deaths, but I may just be lucky, so no one should take this as license to go rummaging. Some women actually smile before being "strangled" and are obviously faking death. The costume makeup is sometimes horrible too. Many of the stranglings look real, but that's a well-known fetish. It's disturbing to watch, but I don't think they're being murdered. I saw the album, but all the pictures looked very artistic (great lipstick, focus on perfectly painted nails), and none of the girls had obvious injuries.Summary:
Summarize: you're retarded, there's a reason we use opiates for managing pain and not weed. It's because the opiates work better. I have also been prescribed opiates for 4 surgeries, and yes, i will honestly say that if they gave me medicinal marijuana instead of opiates i would have been in a whole world of pain. Stronger pain calls for stronger narcotics. I'm not trying to diss marijuana here or anything, i love marijuana, but it's a horrible pain medication, and any doctor that would prescribe it to a patient that's in legitimate pain, is also a retard.Summary:
Summarize: When i was a kid (12 or 13 years ago), i loved to play with peruvians. Gunbound, Ragnarok and Neopets were common places to find them, nice and shy ppl almost everytime. > > > > And then came the future, i was a happy person, i swear. A friend said to me: hey, play Dota with me, is a lot of fun but be aware of peruvians. What, i said, peruvians?, but they are nice ppl!, maybe some with which you played were assholes, but we all are assholes sometimes, don't we? Months have passed, and 800 hours later, for the first time, in a match that ended minutes ago, i had to say: DAMN PERUVIANS, WHAT WERE THEY THINKING!! WHY EVERYTIME I PLAY WITH ONE IS ALL "tmr gg, asco, aggg, comentenme, report" WHY, WHYYYY!! I just want to report all of them. > > > > Maybe, after all this matches playing with they, i became a peruvian too. Sorry Reddit. Sorry Perú. > > > >Summary:
Summarize: So this past week I was responsible for teaching a new hire at work, we'll call her Janet. During the second day, we started hitting it off and talking about our lives and found out we had a lot of similarities. I thought about asking her out, but hesitated. While dating a co-worker isn't explicitly forbidden, it is definitely frowned upon, especially one that I was "mentoring." I have also been known to misread signals sometimes, so I didn't want to risk possible getting in trouble AND rejected at the same time. I spent a few days thinking and decided, "Fuck it, I'm going to go for it." I knew Janet would be at an another co-worker's house tonight for a housewarming party, and I would make my move then. I got to the house and immediately sought her out, we started to flirt, but something was a little off/awkward. There was a guy hanging around her really close, and a little defensively. A mutual friend that had gotten pretty close with Janet noticed, and pulled me aside. She asked I was interested in Janet, and I told her I was, but I was getting weird vibes. She told me that Janet was talking about me all last week, and was definitely interested, but felt like she was getting mixed signals from me. She said Janet was getting a little depressed about, and to cheer her up, she took Janet clubbing 2 days ago and introduced her to a guy friend. That was the guy at the party, and they apparently hit it off pretty well. It became an awkward situation for me cause the guy came to the party for Janet, so she couldn't really ditch him, and for only knowing each other a couple days they were surprisingly close already. My friend apologized and said that if she had know that I was for sure interested, she wouldn't have set her up with another guy. So this is where I'm left. I do legitimately like this girl, and it is actually pretty rare for me to find someone I'm interested in. Do I just drop it issue? Hope that she and the new guy burn out quickly? Or should I tell her that I was in fact interested, but I didn't know how to handle the situation since we work together?Summary:
Summarize: Fellas, the time has come where I may need to buy another car, and I am having a hell of a time deciding! Ideally, the car would be fun to drive, relatively light, two doors, and great looks. 25k$ max, but I'm willing to push it a little if its the right car. Ive been looking at the BMW 2002, Alfa Romeo GTV, Porsche 968, 1970's to 80's 911, Opel GT, Lotus Elise, every ferrari ever made If I am to get another car, I want the car to be something I genuinely enjoy driving. I want it to have soul, character, maybe even personality. It has to stir my machine-loving emotions. My requirements may seem a little tight, but all that really matters is that the car make me want to drive it! What do y'all suggest?Summary:
Summarize: Greetings! I am brand-new to this sub (in that I just discovered it today) so I apologize if something like my question has already been posted/discussed. I also read the faq and didn't really find anything that answered my question fully - that's the disclaimer, here goes. Please be kind. I'm a HUGE craft beer fan, toeing the line to beer geek territory. The thing is that I'm trying to get back into shape, and craft beer and losing lbs don't exactly go together. What I've decided to do is give up drinking entirely for a little while (for a couple months at least) and then reteach myself to drink my beers in moderation so that I have more success in my health endeavors. (I drink at least 15 beers a week currently, so it's definitely something that must be done.) The problem is that there are so many of the fall seasonals that I absolutely love, as well as a number of winter beers that will be hitting the shelves in the next couple of months or so. Combine those with random limited-release or specialty beers that always seem to pop up and friends bringing back gifts from brewery adventures, and I'll be missing out on a lot of beer while I'm on the wagon, so to speak. What I'm thinking about doing is buying the beers that I want to drink as I find them out on the market and saving them for when I do start to reintroduce beer into my lifestyle. I've heard from several brewers that the "drink by"/expiration date on beers is merely a suggestion and that drinking beer past its date won't do anything to hurt you (most beers at least), so I'm not worried about that. My concern is that keeping beers around for a few months will affect the taste. I don't want to age the beer at all (I'm clearly not advanced enough to try anything like that) because I don't want the flavor to change/mellow/whatever aging beer does but I do want to keep it around for a while. I guess theSummary:
Summarize: I went on a cruise. I smuggled a handle on. got shit faced. went on a bar crawl , tried to steal beer from the bar. asked some 15 year old to dance, thank god she said no. shot one of those hocky puck things way to hard and the officer on duty came out to help me find it. I was too hung over to leave room for last two days of trip.Summary:
Summarize: My husband (29) and I (28) have been married for 7 years, together for 10. We've always had a good sex life and although we've been through some rough patches, I think we have a great relationship and communicate well. However, the more of my friends that divorce, and the more I read about seemingly healthy marriages falling apart, the more I worry that we will face this type of situation sooner or later. We were both virgins when we met (although not by the time we were married), and I worry that sooner of later he will decide that he wants to try someone different. I try to stay physically attractive (and I find him very attractive still). We have no children and no plans to have any. My question is this: Men, what do you wish your wives would do/would have done differently after you'd been married for a while? Wives, what do you do to help spice up your sex life? I'm not interested in swinging, but am open to other suggestions.Summary:
Summarize: That's an indicator on your enemy that shows you that they are currently stunned. Not one that shows when your bear stance can stun that same target again. Apparently they something of that sort for Yasuo's E. At the moment you have to either get a feel for the cooldown, randomly guess, or count 6 seconds to switch back to bear stance and auto them again. And you obviously lose a shit ton of DPS if you happen to fuck up the timing on stance switching and aa to get the stun off a second time.Summary:
Summarize: Facepalm > a) Stop worrying about, pressuring for, or talking about an 'official' label or title. This chick is your girlfriend. b) The reason she wants to have sex with you is not so she can kill herself. You are both being dramatic. c) Don't plan the sex. The weather is awesome. Take her swimming or exploring in the woods or something FUN. Spend the afternoon together. Get a bottle of wine later on. When you are both feeling it, whether in the woods or later that night or whenever, put your penis in this woman . Do not stop for some dramatic, depressing conversation about suicide. Don't even think about her killing herself. In fact, just think about how fucking awesome life is and she'll follow your lead.Summary:
Summarize: Simply by playing some normals with some low level friends or on other low elo accounts, I understand the obsession people have with grouping as a team, simply because I have it as well when playing with them. In a higher level play (at least in my experience) people have a greater idea of how different objectives give you advantages, and mostly have a good understanding on when to push for them. For example, as a jungler, if you have any idea of where the enemy jungler is (be it by wards or otherwise), you will either try to counter his gank, or go to the opposite side of the map in order to have a number advantage and get kills or objectives. Same with laners, they'll push and get damage on the turret/gain a CS advantage if they see the enemy laner somewhere else. Whether these "trades" are convenient determines the outcome of the game, but you can be sure that your teammates are actively trying to create advantages, and not staying passive while the enemy counterpart gets ahead. However, in a lower level of play, not many people understand the need of constantly pushing for leads. This means that while you are getting 4 man ganked, your team may not retaliate in any kind, some times not even a minor thing like pushing and making the enemy miss a wave. This means that no matter how many enemies you draw to yourself, how much time you make the enemy jungler waste, it will never be worth it simply because they got a kill and your team got nothing. Eventually you lose the trust in your team, and think that the only way for them to be useful is to force them to make plays, and since you can't easily tell them to make complicated strategies, you simply tell them to group so that they'll be around when you go for an objective.Summary:
Summarize: OP of this theory obviously didn't think this all the way through, but water and the transience of it is an interesting theme to explore and not a bad jumping off point for Eleven's final goodbye. Water brings life, but also death- Like River did. She killed the Doctor but she also save him in the end- That's not such a stretch at all when you think about it. The Ponds- The transformative nature of water. Water changes the things it touches- You gain some of it when you swim and swallow water, it smooths down rough stones, takes things from point A to point B... water has always been associated with peace, calm, regeneration- Rebirth of a different sort in a way. A whole bunch of ideas like that. The Ponds changed the Doctor in a way that nobody else possibly could- They created River, the Doctor's future wife. They showed him that love can and will find a way even when it seems improbable or unlikely (Rory as the last Centurion, Amy and Madam Kevarian's arc, her speech about Rory...) When the angels took the Ponds and they 'died', the Doctor gave up being the Doctor altogether until Clara showed up to pull him back out again. You could even make the argument that River herself changed the Doctor in some ways, smoothed him as a river's tides smooth the pebbles and stones that fall into it, but that one is more of a stretch to me. Clara- A girl from the sky, like rain renews and rejuvenates an old and tired world. Rainy days give the world a certain 'newness' once they settle and besides, the Doctor must love the rain- One of the passcodes for the TARDIS locks was 'petrichor', the smell of the Earth after it rains. Clara could very well be his petrichor after the rains (sadness, grief and guilt over what happened to the Ponds and River's inevitable death still looming...)- A promise of new things to come and a new beginning. And don't even get me started on the time stream itself- The metaphor is in the name itself. Streams. Moving currents and adaptability, mystery of never knowing quite what's next around the bend even as a Time Lord, battered and beaten by said currents (the Time War, HurtDoc's eventual terrible choice...). So many ways to explore that theme, so much time and space you really could drown in it. In a way, the Doctor and Clara are already drowning in the time stream. They are currently lost within the scar that is the Doctor's life- A rip in the stream itself. You could easily connect that scar to his potential death. Maybe Clara won't be able to swim in the time stream and the Doctor will die to save her. Maybe the paradoxical nature of being inside his own lifestream will 'drown' the Doctor in memories and paradoxes he can't reverse or weasel out of but Clara will somehow save him from complete destruction and the Doctor will regenerate that way. Who knows, I'm just pulling out the first thing to come to mind here, but water as a theme isn't so far off the mark if you ask me. I mean, clearly OP of the pic didn't think too hard about the possibilities and meanings of 'drown' or 'water', but when you take a writer like Moffatt and give him a thread to tie together something as spectacular as the 50th and then Eleven's final moments, you can bet he's thought it through. Water is innocuous enough to go completely unnoticed and yet strong enough to carry a pretty big story if you write it well enough. I don't know, that's just my first impression- Feel free to pick it apart and tell me I'm wrong :pSummary:
Summarize: There was a house fire in a town near me and they were doing a television appeal for the family involved. They did the interview outside the front of the house (the house only partially burned, the garage segment to the side was mostly untouched). This family is looking all cut and then the reporter/interviewer asks "Is there anything that you would really like someone to donate, something that would make your day?". This woman responds "We'd love some bikes for the kids. The three of them have lost everything and bikes would just be something to play with, something for them to own again". Fair enough right? Except for the fact the people hauling goods out of the unburned garage were taking the untouched perfectly fine bikes outside ON CAMERA! I counted 3 bikes leaving that garage and all of them didn't have a scratch. She obviously thought bikes would have good resale value or something.Summary:
Summarize: As someone who loves Aatrox top here's how you should play it: Deck yourself out with offensive masteries and runes preferably, however if you don't want to kill your enemy/you need to be tanky for your team, get a defensive setup. Level 1 start out with W and switch to Blood Price, keep hitting minions and stack up your blood well for a retarded 50% attack speed bonus at level 1, don't worry about the lane being pushed, it will move only slightly at the beginning. Hit level 2 and get your Dark Flight, prime your Blood Price (or if you just used it, hit a minion once at least) and hit the enemy with your stun, hold ~ and right click your opponent and cut him to pieces (~ makes you target only champions, so it ensures you don't waste your autoattacks on minions), when your Blood Price is ready, ignite and smack him with the empowered attack. Afterwards chase with flash and kill him. But, if you're against a counterpick simply don't try to trade, because if Aatrox gets countered he gets countered hard (see: Jax). In that case simply farm up, get 2 points in your W and get a vampiric scepter asap + defensive stats.Summary:
Summarize: edit: Holy shit, this isn't a "little something." This is a damn essay! Just little something I wanted to add, even though I'm not from outside America. I'm from New Jersey. (Yes, get all those "NJ is ass!" jokes out of your system.) I realize you all will have a skewed perspective of our state, given the shit like Jersey Sore, but try and keep an open mind about what I'm about to say. Like a lot of the other comments here, the stuff I love about living in America are the incredible friendly people, the complete craziness of the lengths we go to show each other a good time, all the food, the ability of us to melt together as one people despite our international origins, and Costco. No, seriously, Costco's a big one. I'll get to that at the end. I live in Edison, NJ. We're pretty big, a lot of Asians, Indians, Hispanics, African Americans, EVERYONE. Take a look around town and you're just as liable to see a Russian as a Filipino. Just a decade ago most schools in the area were predominantly Caucasian. Today? The vast majority of students are from Asian countries like China or Korea, as well as Indians and Filipinos. African Americans and Caucasians are still a big part of our community, despite being from different places. I know there's a lot of supposed "racial profiling" and "discrimination" because of skin color, but here in the tri-state area? (NJ, NY, PA) There's almost nothing. Everywhere I've gone to, people accept you for who you are. They don't care if you're straight, bi, gay, black, white, yellow, female, male transgender, WHATEVER. They look you straight in your eye with a smile on their face and ask you, "Hi! How are you doing?" It brings a smile to my face. The sincerity, the simple gesture of goodwill. It really helps a grey, rainy day. I've gone to conventions in NYC where people just wave you over and start talking and laughing with you. I've bumped into other photographers and, instead of simply nodding and walking away, actually put down our cameras and shake hands, taking a moment to enjoy each others' company. Of course, having some common ground helps, but the way they explore your personality without getting too personal is amazing. Of course there's tons of drama between people, over boyfriends stolen and personality conflicts, but these get resolved, and the friendships repair themselves. Americans forgive. They may not always forget, but they do forgive. This is a major part of what makes life here good. If you apologize to someone, most of the time they'll give you a smile and tell you, "It's okay. It was only an accident!" You both smile big grins and share a laugh, and go on with your day a bit brighter than before. It astounds me that Americans can be friendly even in the wee hours of the morning. I was on a return trip from Taiwan when we stopped in Anchorage for a layover. We waited on line for customs, when we heard laughter. The customs officers were joking around with the people at their stalls. (Keep in mind this was 2:00 AM, and we were all tired and cranky from a 17 hour plane ride.) The line shortened, and when it was my turn and I walked up to the desk, my customs officer - big, burly, with a kick-ass mustache - did something I wouldn't forget. He made a weed joke. No, seriously, a weed joke. I don't know why but he did, and the two of us just cracked up laughing. He asked the usual "Business or Pleasure" and I told him I was back for a wedding, he grinned a big one and started chatting with me about the beauty of weddings and the fun we have at them. It's moments like these I'm glad I live in America and not somewhere else where queuing is a necessary, joyless act. Another great part about Americans is our attitude towards life. I have an older brother who, by all intents and purposes, is smart. REALLY smart. He went to Rutgers Pharmacy, came out with a PharmD in 6 years, turned DOWN a $100,000 job to do a $75,000 job at a medical advertising company doing something he loves. (I know 75,000 is still a lot, but keep in mind that for a pharmacist, this is low.) If he were in Taiwan, for example, he would've gone to the more profitable job even if it meant mindless work and simple tasks that he hated and despised. In America, we learn to think differently. We don't always do things for the money; rather, we do things that we love. Recently, the director of Restrepo was killed. It's a terrible tragedy, but notice he was doing something he loved. I know this isn't just restricted to Americans, but it is a major defining point. We chase our dreams, our goals; that is what drives us. Oh, I mentioned Costco, too, right? Well, that's because Costco helped put my brother through college by offering him a job while he went to school for about three-times the minimum wage ($22.00/hour!) and helped schedule him around his classes. I know this is a regional thing, but still, it's a good thing to point out. The incredible quality of good, almost ridiculous return policies, and the amazing Food Court help, too.Summary:
Summarize: I'm a rather new Redditor and this is not my main account but I need to get some things off my chest, process it all, and maybe get some advice. If this is the incorrect sub I apologise and please tell me where else I can go. I'm a nineteen year old girl from Australia. I was born in Central West New South Wales as the only (that I know) child of two addicts. My father was convicted at fourteen and spent most of his life before I was born as an aggressive and depressed alcoholic and drug dealer. He met my mother when she was in her early 20s and he established himself to my mother and her sister as a dealer. Within a few years he managed to get her to marry him and then dragged her out to a town (population of under 300) in to the middle of the country where the land is almost completely barren, not even the kangaroos would live there. He kept her there for more than a decade, during which time I was born. Through their various rages at me I've learnt from them that she still used coke and ecstasy throughout her pregnancy with me, but mainly used oxycodone^1. My mother left him when I was 18 months but I have vague memories and flashbacks^2 from then of dark rooms, shocking heat and a woman begging and screaming. She managed to escape to the coast on a train and found a women's refuge and managed to sober up enough to get us a dingy unit before my father followed her and found himself somewhere to live nearby. Between the ages of 2 and 5 I was relatively happy but this was really the beginnings of her abuse. I don't particularly think she meant to but she is and was so fucked up by the things that happened to her at the hands of my father and by the drugs themselves (which were evidently more varied than what I've been informed of) that I don't know whether to pity her or not. Between the ages of four and sixteen she forced me into seeing 12 counsellors, 8 psychologists, and 6 psychiatrists. I was diagnosed with depression, social anxiety, ADHD, ADD, Borderline Personality Disorder and manic depression, among other things, and was put on more and more prescription drugs as the time went on. But this was all masking the actual issues, which was that she beat me. She hit me, kicked me, pulled my hair out, forced soap so far down my throat she knocked out some of my teeth, and locked me in my bedroom for days at a time. I've done some reading online and she fits most if not all of the symptoms of Münchausen's Syndrome by Proxy, that she tried to gather sympathy for herself through me and tried to make it look worse by faking and even causing me to have illnesses. This became worse when my father, who refused to leave the city, took her to the family courts and managed to get dual custody of me when I was 7. I spent tuesday nights and even second weekends at his unit before then (from the age of 5), and became used to checking for syringes and broken glass in the grass and it was at that time that I saw my first dead body hunched over on the stairwell to our unit, surrounded by blood. Regardless, he still managed to get dual custody of me because I was more scared of my mother than my father at that point and over the course of that year (2002) I spent equal time between the two hovels. In the summer of 2003 my mother had one of her friends stay for two weeks. This friend and her son (a year older than me) stayed in my room and not only did I have to sleep in my mother's room (sometimes her bed, sometimes the floor), but I wasn't allowed in my bedroom at all. One afternoon I tried to go in my room to pick out a book to read and her friend pushed me out, pushed me against the wall and screamed at me. I started crying, ran into the kitchen and grabbed a knife before slicing into my throat. My mother saw it, called my father, and had him take me away to his house. I didn't see my mother again for close to two years, except for one time I was in hospital.* I had always had hearing difficulties, and my first year with my father doctors found out I had tumours in my head ( NOT brain tumours, they're between the brain and the skull itself) and I had my first operation to remove them then. Since then I've had 5 more surgeries, each time they've more aggressive (to the point of brain fluid leaking on the operating table and weeks in hospital to recover). The time taken to recover from the procedures, as well as other complications^3 has lead me to decide that it's better to live to 35 relatively normally than to 55 and spend half the time in bed and in pain. Essentially, I'm halfway through my life already, and I'm okay with that now. I'm a big girl, and I've had years to make this decision. So between 2003 and 2005 (age 8-10) I lived with my father exclusively and I don't remember much about this period besides vague memories, flashbacks and night terrors, mostly of things he did to me, or things he threatened to. Every couple of weeks he would grab onto my arm and pull me to the front door saying he was taking me 'to buy a box'. This box, he said, would need to be taken care of because as soon as we got home he would pack my clothes into it and drive me to _ , this suburb known for being a red-light district with more murders than births each year, as well as lots of gang activity. He said that within a week I'd be selling myself from this cardboard box, within a month I'd be shooting up inside it, within a year I'd be giving birth inside it, and within a decade I'd be buried inside it in an unmarked grave, as a sign of how worthless I am. That's stuck with me ever since, and it's still hard to process how he could hate his only daughter that much. I also remember him pretending to kill himself in front of me before getting up, cackling with glee, and pinning my hands behind my back and locking me in my room for a few days with just a bucket to piss in, a loaf of bread, and a lettuce. He also... lit my vagina on fire at one point. I don't remember it, I've blocked it out, but I've got burn scars over my vulva. He never told me why but as I've grown up I've worked out that he didn't want me to be able to have casual sex, if any sex at all. I don't know if he molested me, I wouldn't say I know he did, but it wouldn't surprise me given the burns and the fact that when I behaved he would 'reward me' by making me sleep in his bed, and before he went to sleep he'd turn the television to porn channels. I lost my virginity when I was twelve to this boy from school and he showed me that not everyone will hurt me, and I loved that feeling. I lived through it for years. I dropped out of school when I was thirteen because I was already earning a reputation and a group of boys would beat me up (to the point of broken bones) and sexually assault me a couple of times a week. I kept my mouth shut because these boys' parents were friendly with the principal and nobody would believe what I said anyway. But I got fed up eventually and in September 2008 I walked out of class and never went back. It seems that nobody even noticed me missing from school because nobody ever came to check on me. So, I began walking on a bad path, I met some people, had a lot of stupid sex, formed an addiction to it, and I moved drugs on the side for some income. Most of which I had to pay in rent to my mother in order to stay there instead of living on the street again. I was sixteen I overdosed. I'd had enough and really just reeling from some news I'd got a few months before^3. My mother's oxy^1 use (and perhaps the burns as well) had left me sterile. I had believed that I was going to be a mother one day and prove to myself I could be a better parent to my own children than mine were to me, but this was basically a slap in the face, and is one of the reasons I'd rather die at 35 than 55. There's just not that much use in me being alive any longer than that if there's nobody relying on me. Alas, evidently I didn't die then but I felt absolutely crap just looking at where I was in life so I decided to start a course and finish high school. I finish it completely next month, but I've stopped caring about it any more. It just isn't something that caters to my interests, and I'm not any happier now either. However, just before I started my course I met my ex boyfriend, this was mid 2012. We were in different social classes, but I figured he loved me because we had enough in common. I guessed wrong. We were together for more than a year, not that long for most people, but longer than anything I've managed before that. He was sweet, caring, and his family liked me, and I gave him every part of me that I could. But this wasn't enough and he turned obsessive, paranoid, nasty and abusive. Oh, and he cheated on me with another girl, which he used as a reason to break up with me, though that wasn't the reason I was given; which was that apparently his mother had seen me smoking crack, when I'd never even touched the stuff. But I was okay with that, I knew I was better off without him. This was mid 2013. 2013 was a clusterfuck. My grandmother died, my boyfriend dumped me 3 days after my 18th bithday, my dog died a month later and then, the pièce de résistance, I was raped by the man who lives next door to me. This was October 5th 2013. My finals started a week later and I failed all of them because I wasn't able to study, and I had panic attacks during the exams themselves. It's been a year and I still live next to him, and I can't afford to move. The Police said they can't do anything because I have no proof (besides scars) and the only things that are keeping me sane at this point is my other dog (a Great Dane), my best friend (who is pretty much my new boyfriend), my bong, and a bayonet from the First World War which I keep beside my bed to give me some feeling of security. My house caught fire in April, and a few months later the bolts to my screen door were cut. Twice. My mother laughed at me when I told her that I was raped because she likes the guy, but over the past 12 months we've begun to repair our relationship though I'm still wary of her and mainly use her to help me do my grocery shopping because I can't afford a car and this area has too many hills to be able to carry the bags home. On a side note, my mother told me that my father moved to the US (Arizona) in late 2008 and married a banker before beating her, divorcing her, taking her money and fleeing to Mexico. I haven't heard about him in two years, and I haven't spoken to him since early 2008. I know I need therapy, I know I've got problems. I can't sleep unless I'm stoned because of my PTSD^2 and I'm still dealing with sex addiction, but I've recently kicked my cigarette addiction (of a pack a day for around 4 years, and half packs for 3 years) which I've got going for me. Which is nice. I could really do with some advice on what to do.Summary:
Summarize: RAINN is usually very good if you fit their idea of what a rape victim should look like. If for whatever reason you don't fit the mold... well, they'll send you elsewhere. Though note that I do know a male RAINN counselor who was a victim himself and thus would know better, so there's bound to be a few good ones. I wouldn't call them a joke. Just... hit or miss. I certainly would recommend them to any woman who's been raped by a man, especially if that man was a stranger or if she was date raped. That's what they're expecting. But as for the reasons some female victims turn on the male ones, that's actually very complex. I have my guesses as to what's going on. I ascribe it to bad counseling (or lack there of) because something a lot of people fail to understand is that victims blame themselves to gain agency. That is to say, the way the brain deals with serious mental trauma is to try to figure out how to not have it happen again, but that often manifests as self blame ("if only I'd done X or hadn't done Y, I wouldn't have been raped"). This automatic self blame is why so many people talk about "victim blaming" as being a serious problem... the victims do it to themselves, so it's very easy to encourage that behavior, which isn't good for healing. The problem is many people don't realize the root cause (a need for control over what happened so it can't happen again) and attack the symptom (the self blame). This results in people thinking they're helping by telling the victim over and over "It's not your fault" without actually listening to them or providing some way for them to feel safe. The result is the victim gets trained to never say anything that might make it sound like they feel at fault... but they still have that need for safety. So they'll switch to an aggressive mode... it's the aggressor's fault. That sounds great, except they're doing it to protect themselves in the future, so they'll blame it on everyone like the aggressor ("Any man can be a rapist!"). This is, of course, a hidden version of self blame... "If I hadn't been permanently on guard around men, I wouldn't have been raped." I can't prove that's exactly what's happening, but I find the "all men could be rapists" crowd is often made up in large part of rape victims who were constantly given the "It's not your fault" line over and over without the person actually listening to them (to be clear, "It's not your fault" will absolutely come up, but it's more delicate than that, and it comes along with giving them agency and listening to them). The thing is, these women have now been subtly trained that they can be safe from rape if they just don't trust men. That gives them agency and a feeling of safety, no matter how false the idea is. And they can cling to that. They can be angry at men for the horrible damage they do, and they can have some comfort in the knowledge that if they're angry at them, they won't be put in that situation again. But now imagine a guy comes along claiming he was raped. Worse, as is common in female aggressor/male victim rape, he's also saying that the woman faked a rape charge against him to keep him silent. She can't have this... it says that everyone can be a threat, that her model of the world is off, that her simplified (and safe) world view might be wrong... and that's terrifying. Or, far easier, she can just assume he must be the rapist and he's just lying to cover it up, and everything will be nice and safe and clear again. You can guess which one she's going to be tempted to chose. And thus we get female victims regularly silencing and attacking male victims, all the while sure they're doing the right thing. The solution to this, of course, is better counseling for everyone, that goes well beyond the basic "It's not your fault" sugar pill that too many people are taught to hand rape victims and assume that will make them all better. It takes time to guide someone in crisis towards healing, and you can't just work off a script or utter a few magic words to fix everything in one go. For a lot of people, though, I guess it's just not worth their time, or worth the difficulty in actually listening to the person who needs their help.Summary:
Summarize: The games they've been playing just aren't compatible with their sense of humor. The Grumps tend to work better when playing a game they've never played before (Dan with Pokemon) or something random like Chulip or Go Go Nippon. They start playing games like Pokemon or South Park because they have played them before, but once they start recording they tend to forget things and start worrying about entertaining the audience. Which leads to things like Arin rapping or Dan telling a story that doesn't really have anything to do with the game or conversation. I think the grumps should decide whether they want to be a comedy channel and always play games like Chulip or an LP channel and play games like Pokemon and SoTC.Summary:
Summarize: And I wanted to talk about it! Background: I live in Canada, I'm 22M, and this is (jackass!) a throwaway. I'm not particuarly gay and I read that anal has been more and more common among heterosexuals lately so I don't feel weird or anything about it and I always wanted to try it. I've always had a very low level of prudishness(?) and am willing to try pretty much anything at least once and wanted to share my experience with everyone, particularly other males who are considering anal but don't know what to expect. Not that I am an expert or anything, this was only my first time too. There was no partner involved, just some toys I ordered online. It took until now for me to realize that I'm an adult with my own apartment and credit card, and I can finally buy some toys to try out. My haul included: A 9" Blue Jelly Rubber Dildo ( which I found out after the fact was not the best choice, see here for details but my gag reflex was too strong, so that idea was out since I wasn't going to try it again after I'd used it anywhere but my mouth no matter how much I cleaned it. Up to that point I'd already loosened myself up gradually with other toys so that when I finally inserted this one, there was next to no discomfort in the penetration. I was surprised to find I could take all 9 inches up to the hilt on my very first time (is that normal?), and having all of it inside me was very satisfying. The only downside to this toy, besides learning later about the rubber thing, was that it had a very poor suction cup on its base, making mounting it on the wall or anything dificult, and no form of adhesive like tape will stick to it for very long. In the end I constructed a sort of holster out of tape folded in on itsself that the rubbery balls portion docks with and remains locked tightly. I hope I can find a pthalate-free alternative/replacement. If anyone has any suggestions, please share! A Generic Wireless Remote Vibrator . It has one speed and seven options for the rhythm. Pink and waterproof! It's starting speed was a bit strong at first, but became very enjoyable after I grew acclimated to it. A second hard plastic vibrator , this one long and thin. It has a dial for speed at the base and goes faster then anything else I bought. Stimulating! A Small (possibly jelly, I should double check that) Vibrating Buttplug . It wasn't very satisfying since at its widest it was still smaller then pretty much all the other toys I got, but still nice for getting used to having things inside me. **[An Aneros Helix]( This didn't really work all that well for me because I don't have very strong muscles down there. I was not able to clench or unclench very hard, long, or often enough to achieve any significant sensation, but I won't rule this out until I've had more practice with it. An intimidating clinical-looking metal thing called the Pure Wand (formerly Jupiter Wand.) I haven't actually tried this one yet but I've read nothing but positive reviews about it. If anyone here has one, please share your experiences with it. Hard Plastic Anal Beads . They're a weird wavy shape but I am eager to try them out soon. That concludes the penetrative purchases, other things I bought were a rubbery red cock ring (It's kind of tight but I think that's the point. I didn't particularly enjoy the feeling of all the blood trapped down there or seeing parts of me turn red, coupled with reading about the risks , and a pair of nipple suckers (black PVC cylinders with a sphere the size of a Mirabelle plum you compress to create suction. Hair gets in the way so its good to be clean shaved anywhere you plan on using them, but otherwise they offer a very strong suction feeling and rarely fall free.) Last but not least, bottles of a silicone-based lubricant , a water-based lubricant , and a toy cleaning disinfectant type deal ([which I am now having second thoughts about after reading this comment]( I found the silicone-based was not as lubricating as the water-based, but lasted much longer. Water-based was very slippery but required more and more often applicated to yield desireable results. As always, take care to avoid using silicone based lubricant in conjunction with silicone based toys. Kind of a lot for first time buying, right? In the end it came out to be about 200$, since a lot of it was on sale. The metal Pure Wand dealie is usually around 100$ on its own so I'm pretty happy with what I got. The only product I didn't get in this initial spree I was interested in was an inflatable buttplug. If anyone has any experience with these, please feel free to share! Enough stories from me though, I do have questions too, beyond the ones asking about the specifics of various toys I mentioned before! Most of all my biggest concerns are about keeping myself and my new toys clean, avoiding any common problems, infections, or injuries I as a newcomer may face (are there even common injuries?) and most of all, I'd like to hear about others experiences with toys and their recommendations of products I might consider in the future.Summary:
Summarize: Fellow dads, I'm in need of some help when it comes to my daughters TV viewing. I'll start with the question and then go into more detail: What do you watch with your daughters, and what do you allow them to watch? My daughter is young. I work nights, so I'm basically a stay at home dad. I end up watching what Molly wants to watch more than what dada wants to watch. We watch Sesame Street, Doc McStuffins, Mickey, Sophia the First, and our personal favorite, Adventure Time. I think Adventure time and Sesame Street has ideas and lessons that can be very beneficial (sharing, friendship, manners, being yourself). I'm looking for more "female empowering" shows for her to watch. I bought her [this T shirt]( a few weeks ago, and she loves it, mostly because I like it so she likes it. I'm not a huge fan of Doc or Sophia. I'm trying really hard to avoid "princesses" and I would much rather have her watching better shows but I'm having a tough time coming up with options. So men of Daddit, what do you watch with your daughters that you enjoy that you feel teaches them good life lessions?Summary:
Summarize: I had a buddy like you. He was obsessed with knowing what it was like to be with more than the girl he had been with for 4 years. He finally found out by being a POS, he cheated on his girlfriend and broke up with her the next day. Lived the "single and always down to fu...meangle" life. It lasted about two months before he was whining daily about how he fucked up and his ex is a asshole for not taking him back.Summary:
Summarize: About exactly a week ago I had sex and made out with someone I know, and just recently (in the last few days) they felt ill and went to the doctor because they thought they had the flu. The doctor told them they have mono. Obviously if I've never been exposed to mono, I might have definitely been infected. However, as far as I'm aware, I have not been infected in youth. Then again I wouldn't know. So what the fuck do I do? I can't afford to be taking off work at all because I recently took off a few days because I had the flu, and I'm new to the job. They'll kill me if I take any more days off. Also, i don't want mono! FmlSummary:
Summarize: Last Friday a friend, his girlfriend and myself all went to see the Dirty Heads (for the third time) at a local venue. I went in with the mission of trying to find a girl to dance with throughout the show and he, obviously, did not have this option open to him. We were sitting through the opening acts and standing off to the side when we saw two girls (one taller girl with long blonde hair and a short brunette) who looked like college girls wearing interesting clothes (Let's just say, they weren't church clothes and it was a little bit chilly to be wearing what they were in Wisconsin). I made a comment to my friend and his girl about how I was going to dance with them by the end of the night and my mission was set. About 15 minutes later, the two girls I had my eye on came back from the crowd and made their way to about right in front of where we were standing. And when I say right in front, I mean about less than a foot away, so it was a pretty deliberate move. A couple minutes later the blonde flipped her hair back and it hit me in the face. She then turned to me and said "Oops, did that hit you?!" I respond with "haha yeah," she then says, "Oh okay, good". At this point I was kind of freaking out and obviously picking up on her vibe. When the next song came on from Oh No Fiasco, I was going to reflect her energy and excitement, even if I wasn't familiar with any of their songs. She then started to dance and grind on me, which was completely fine by me. About thirty minutes since the beginning of this sequence, she turns to me and mentions something about kissing, in which I of course respond positively. This is where it starts to get good. She begins to make out with me (she turned left, I turned right, kind of awkward for a little bit but we figured it out) and for a couple of minutes, it was the luckiest thing to ever happen to me. But this was just the beginning. She starts to feel bad for her shorter friend who has no one to dance with, so they decide to switch. So I have her friend grinding on me, and I'm feeling pretty good. After about 15 minutes later, her friend comes up to me and tries to talk in my ear (which all of you know is pretty damn hard to understand when there is music playing about 25 feet away from you at a concert) and I can't really make out (heh heh) what she is saying, but I pick out a few key words. These words have absolutely nothing to do with what was about to happen, which only made the experience that much more awesome. I thought that she wanted to "GO" or "SMOKE" on the balcony (it's a smoke free venue, so there is a smokers section, kinda bullshit but whatever) so i was ready to turn to my friend and say, "I'll be back in a few". At this point, I am moving in slo-mo and my senses are at the peak of their awareness. I am trying to figure out what is about to happen when, suddenly, they both start making out with me. It was... Incredible. Incredibly sloppy, but incredible nonetheless. I didn't think that I could ever be that lucky, but at this moment, I was. In the middle of this three-way-make-out session, I gave my buddy a high five as he was just as, if not more, impressed than I was. Once this exchange was over, they both started to grind on my at the same time, one of each leg. This went on for another 10-15 minutes until they got up closer to the front of the venue, never to have an exchange with them again, which frankly, I was perfectly content with. I'm going to finish this off by saying that I went a full year without kissing another girl and I am not the kind of guy to whore himself around like this, but I was not going to let this opportunity pass. I am no where near a buff man or a masculine specimen, but I am not fat or a neck beard. Sorry for the wall of text and this will probably get buried, but hey, it must be worth some sort of internet points, right? Well, this is the luckiest thing to ever happen to me and it is my favorite concert memory. Thanks for reading. Edit:Summary:
Summarize: My family used to breed pitbulls. Any dog has the tools and strength to become powerfully aggressive and fuck you up. After watching four generations of pitbulls grow up into the sweetest, most loyal dogs ever, I can tell you with absolute certainty that there is a complete bias towards pitbulls. I have never been attacked by one of the dogs. If you raise a dog to be aggressive, it will be aggressive. If you raise a dog the right way, good job, you now have a companion that will follow and protect you.Summary:
Summarize: Fortunately this wasn't a super drawn-out or serious relationship, but I was young and naive and head over heals for this guy I worked with. He was 32, I was 18, he was on the rocks for a while with a long-term girlfriend, and we started hooking up right after they broke up and he moved out. It got more serious and went on for about 6 months, while we never put a label on it he told me he wasn't interested in dating anyone else. One day I get a message from a random friend, asking if I was still dating this dude because her friend had a crush on him. I thought it was weird but responded that I was. She called me and told me that he'd been with this other girl for the same amount of time as me, and she had become his "girlfriend" about 3 months before. So, technically, he was cheating on her with me. Me and girl 2 (we were Facebook friends and had met a few times) talked on the phone and told each other our histories with dude. We had very similar stories. We decided the best way to go about it would be to ambush him. She parked a few blocks away from my apartment and came in while I invited him over to "talk." We were sitting on the couch when he walked in and I will NEVER forget the look on that fucker's face. We spent about an hour yelling it him, telling him he was a piece of shit, and he had the fucking nerve to tell girl 2 that I was a huge mistake and he had realized just the day before that he was in love with her. Ouch. We high-fived, reaffirmed our chicks before dicks philosophy, and I told her to call me if she was having a hard time. She took him back two days later and they're still together.Summary:
Summarize: Two of my friends and I were playing Smash Brothers in one of our basements in high school, while his mother hosted a book club meeting upstairs. A few of the book club members had brought their children, who had found their way into the basement and were playing ping-pong nearby. One of my friends had something awful befall him in the game, which happened fairly often as he was awful at it, and yelled out, "GOD-FUCKING DAMMIT!!" He then looked over at the children playing ping-pong, who were all under the age of ten, and said, "I mean...SHUCKS DARNSY!"Summary:
Summarize: Think of it! The first thing that may come to mind may be extra battery life, which is what most people think of when they think of a solar panel but there is so much more to it. It could tie in with 'Find My iPhone' so the phone may never be powered off in lost mode. I know you are thinking, "what if the criminal just covers the panel?" Well if the phone was in lost mode and detects the panel is covered then it should go into a prolonged standby and send its location every so often...Which lead me to thinking... If the phone is in lost mode shouldn't we allow the crook to turn the phone off (in lost mode) which would put the phone into a false off state, but would also be the same prolonged standby if the solar panel was covered. Whew glad I got that off my chest... Okay so the iPhone is really thin, but with wireless charging and solar panels imagine all those _ you could be charging? Apple could put mobile chargers out of business. Oh and those new bluetooth wireless headphones and wireless charging? Yeah, you got it big boy. This was just a Shower thought, I'd thought you guys would appreciate it more than /r/ShowerThoughts It came along out of my Tombstone idea where you pre-record a video for anyone in life who comes to your grave so you can tell them things.

Summarize: So this happened the other day actually, but friday was my birthday (dancing queen, young and sweet, only 17), and I planned on having a pretty cool birthday party on Saturday. Pizza, cake, video games, the works. The thing is, most of my friends graduated last june, so i dont have much for friends, except my Youth Group that i attend after school. So me being the lonely little shit that I am, invite my Youth Group friends, about 10-13 16 and 17 year olds, a good party. Except, as I was handing out invitations, a few kids said they had to work that weekend, but "they'd try to make it." Another thing to mention is that these kids all live in town, and I live out in the country, and its about a half hour drive. I drive it twice a day 4 times a week, shouldnt be a problem for these guys. Anyways, as the week before my birthday went on, I was getting increasingly nervous, and anxious, and scared, because what if they dont want to come? what if they cant come? what if no one shows up? So finally wednesday rolls around, after youth group, driving a girl to her house afterwards. I casually ask if her and her brother, another invitee, will be showing up friday night, and she says maybe. Her and her friend that drives her everywhere were "fighting" at the time, so she didnt know if she could get a ride. I say okay, say I'd talk to her tomorrow, drive away and lose. My. Shit. I'm driving, I'm bawling my eyes out, I'm yelling at myself and hitting myself and asking myself why I'm so dumb and why i would even consider having a party when I'm stupid and gross and nobody likes me anyways. I get home, snapchat everyone "partys cancelled", get drunk, ask God why i'm such a fuckup, and cry myself to sleep. Skip school on thursday, lay in bed all day crying and feeling like crap, mother is kind and makes a good supper as an "early birthday supper" because i felt bad and we had to work the next day. Worked friday, was better, still upset about me being stupid, everyone texting me "happy birthday" and facebook posts whatever. Saturday, do fuck all, clock strikes 6 pm, sad because i dont have a party, so parents take me out for supper. Nice. While we're at supper, my stomach starts hurting. Come home, go to the bathroom. A fucking slaughterhouse has opened up shop in my panties jesus christ. I look in the mirror and just say "oh."Summary:
Summarize: So, askreddit asked me what advice I had for the younger crowd and this was my contribution. I was too late to the party and nobody will see it, so I'm shamelessly copying it here. Not only does venting feel that much better when someone actually reads it, but I WISH I read a post like this two years ago. So here it goes; I'm not really old, but I'm sad to say that when it comes to buying a house I've grown old out of a bad experience. So, I'll give you; "How to buy a house" . Option 1 : You're buying a new house with all the warranty that comes with it. Well, it's going to cost you, but it's great. Good choice. Make sure the company is a serious one because if it goes belly up during your warranty period you might get fucked. There's not much else that can go wrong here. Spend the extra dollars of having a professional go through the house before the warranty expires just to be sure. No problem Option 2: You're buying a really old house, it looks like shit, and your getting it dirt cheep. Hey, you got a big job ahead, or money set aside to pay someone to fix it up. Either way, that's not a problem because you know this place is a shithole and that's what you're paying for. Option 3: You're buying a old house, but it's partly or completely renovated. Who cares if it's old right? It looks so great, and even though your paying a lot for that newly renovated standard it's still a tad cheaper than a new place right? Great deal right? NO, WRONG . Now is the time to be fucking careful my friend. Anyone can pick up dog shit, wrap it in foil and put a nice little ribbon on it. Looks like fine Belgian chocolate now does it not? Well, it's fucking dog shit. Anyone can paint old rotten wood, and it will look great for about six months. Then you can enjoy the sweet taste of dog shit as it seeps through the tin foil and between your stupid teeth. Anyone can put down some fine ass tiles on a old bathroom, but you won't know if it's really well done until a year later when the bedroom downstairs is either dry or wet as fuck with Winnie the poo and all kinds of shit living in a moldy forest between your floors. But Warcraft MD are you saying I should just stick with option 1 or 2? That really limits available houses. Yeah, it does. But a moldy fuck forest behind your bedroom walls will really limit your lungs, and your wallet if you ever wish to try and resell the godforsaken peace of shit house, that is. So if you HAVE to go with option 3, here's what you do: You can't see the important parts of the house, so be really up tight about the parts you can see. Is there a piece of missing paint at the bottom of the wall by the corner? Who cares right? You can pick up a paint brush and fix that shit up in no time. Probably just some old damage from a kid or a dog or something right? Does not matter, right? FUCKING WRONG . It means the people who live here do not care about details, if they could not pick up a paint brush before selling their newly renovated house they sure as hell did not do a proper job on all the other shit they did either. Is one fucking tile slightly miss-aligned? Don't buy that fucking house or that tile will forever stare you down while your sitting on your throne trying to force out a shit into your shitty house with shitty pipes knowing that you will forever be in a shitty place economically because of he shitty decision you made when you bought a shitty ass house with a shitty ass tile that tried to warn you about how shitty your life could become.Summary:
Summarize: Honestly... I don't want to jump on the "Assholes always get the women" bandwagon because it's a cheap excuse for why you didn't- "Nice guys" need to take some ownership here. Let me break this down: So you're a "nice guy". You are attentive, unoffensive, and act like a true gentlemen. You hold the door, listen, let her speak, and generally make sure she is ok. You know who else does that? Her grandmother. Don't go all in on the first hand. Leave something to be desired. An asshole (player, whatever you want to call it) won't because they just don't care. How can she tell the difference right away? If she asks what you do for a living- tell her your job title- nothing else. Don't fucking rant every goddamn detail like "It's a great job, I'm 5 years vested in the 401k, and the senior partners are really nice. My clients are mostly HVAC, and a few distributors as well.... GAH!" Don't fucking offer up information until she asks- if her interest is piqued, you will have the opportunity, and will help the conversation. And listen to her- but don't fucking stare at her. Don't be creepy and intense. This is difficult- you need to act like you're not into her (Hey- another easy proposition if you're an asshole and actually don't care). She's not revealing the Harry Potter ending- she's just telling you about something that she wants you to know. Posture is key. Don't clasp your hands with elbows on the table. Don't fidget and let your hands play with the glass/silverware. It's fine to lean back- I always find the least defensive posture is to lean to one side, elbow on the chair rail, and the other hand loosely holding your drink. Don't lean back and cross your arms. Pro-tip: Watch talk show hosts- they are very good at being interested but not too intense. To me, the above is why people say "assholes always get the girl". They might be an asshole- but that's not relevant. No woman actually wants to date an asshole- but they want someone who is confident and intriguing- not overbearing, clingy, or too forward. Unfortunately a lot of assholes have these great traits when dating. You can't feign confidence, and if you truly don't give a shit it is almost indistinguishable if it's confidence or not giving a shit. So assholes have a leg up there- not giving a shit about someone's feelings and playing them superficially is indistinguishable from just being confident and happy. It's all about being calm- you don't get overly attentive when your aunt tells you about her new Boston Terrier- bring that attitude on the date. Women (and men) prefer a relaxed environment where the conversation flows, and you will know it's going well when your date starts asking you more questions. If they don't ask questions- you've either scared them by staring into their soul while they told you about their path to a teaching degree, of you already told them everything they were going to ask.Summary:
Summarize: I know this from personal experience, it is difficult but not impossible. My ex-so had pulled the same thing on me. I did not take it quite as well as you did and I got quite mad at her. It was not until these past weeks that my kid sister, who had loved my ex got back in contact with her that we started talking again. It was awkward and it still is but we are now getting used to the idea of seeing each other as mostly friends and it gets easier by the minute. However, the first months were a bitch and things went down hill fast. There was arguing and cursing out and we both said things we regret. I still cannot trust her but I am getting more used to the idea. It was her initial desire to be just friends and I am the one who caused the difficulties. I think op has a much better situation than I did and he will probably be better off than me seeing how it has already working towards the goal of becoming friends. Good luck mateSummary:
Summarize: Summary: Branch swinging is embedded in the female DNA. There's no getting rid of it. Even if she marries you, the hypergamy reins supreme and she will always, ALWAYS be looking for a better man. [Full article here.]( I didn't know whether to laugh or cry after reading this article, which first caught my eye on Yahoo News' frontpage. Laugh because it proves every damn thing we say on TRP, or cry because society has devolved to the point where female hypergamy is just seen as a cutsey little thing that men have to shrug, accept and live with. An article celebrating cheating and hypergamy on the front page, for Christ's sake. Anyway, I digress. Let's dissect it... >We think it's fair to say that every married gal gets a little antsy on occasion and Robin Rinaldi, author The Wild Oats Project, is no exception. But unlike those of us who simply wonder what it would be like to take a break from our husbands — Rachel and Ross style — Rinaldi actually acted on it. >After being hitched to her spouse, Scott Mansfield, for 18 years, she made the critical decision to enter into a year-long open marriage so that she could experience life (and by life we mean sex) with other people. And by open marriage, I assume you mean banging Chads around the world while hubby gets to stay home and water the lawn and cook dinner. Is my assumption correct? Let's read on. >Rinaldi, 51, who lives in San Francisco, says that she and Mansfield, a brewer and wine-maker, were "stuck in a rut." She told the New York Post, "Our once-a-week sex life was loving, but lacked spontaneity and passion." I.e. life with a beta. The woman will sigh and spread her legs out for him once a week or so just because its her wifely duty, but beta males don't arouse any passion or excitement. Women love uncertainty. They love danger. A doting husband is the opposite of that. >But, unimaginative sex isn't what convinced Rinaldi to try her experiment, and ultimately write a book about it. She says that she finally reached a breaking point in her early thirties when she realized that despite years of pleading, Mansfield would never be willing to have a child with her. >She wrote in The Wild Oats Project, "I refuse to go to my grave with no children and only four lovers ... If I can't have one, I must have the other." She had her beta husband but couldn't put the ultimate lockdown on him - kids. Growing frustrated, she realized that she had made a huge mistake settling for this subpar male while her body was going baby-crazy and needed an alpha to impregnate her. >"I reached a point that a lot of us face in midlife where I was about to have an affair. I knew I was going to cheat, or we were going to get a divorce and something had to change. And I figured if I was going to do it, I was going to be fair and give him the freedom. I knew it was a long shot," she explains. Bolded emphasis mine. Observe the brutally honest female, admitting that all of her girlfriends have thought the same thing. It's almost refreshing that this woman is so open about the fact that women cheat and lie. Usually the feminist-types try to hide this fact. >And now for the terms: Rinaldi rented an apartment where she lived from Monday through Friday. There she was allowed to court as many suitors as she liked. On the weekends, she returned to her husband and they lived like a happily married couple without asking each other what or who they did during the week. >"It wasn't as strange as you might imagine. I liked it. It was the perfect balance, living on my own during the week and then returning home," she writes. "We had sex as always and the open marriage spiced things up — at least at first." >The few conditions were that they had to practice safe sex, could't sleep with mutual friends, and had to avoid "serious" relationships. Perfectly reasonable clauses, though they were all violated. >Rinaldi, who had been off the market for awhile, began her exploits by posting an ad on nerve.com. Within one day, she had 23 offers. >Her first paramour was a 40-year-old lawyer but she quickly moved on to younger men. She recalls texting her hubby goodnight from a Las Vegas hotel room immediately after a 23-year-old guy left her bed. >Over all, she had 12 encounters. Two were with women, one of them was a threesome. >After her trial year of condoned dalliances was up, however, Rinaldi and her husband struggled to make their marriage work. "Moving back home full time proved more difficult than I had thought. After you open up a marriage and experience a whole range of sexual variety and aspects of yourself you've never had before, it's hard to put everything back in the box. You're changed." >"Suddenly I found an updated version of myself. The person I was at 44 was so much different than the woman I'd been when I was last single at 26. She was less shy, more confident, wilder." >Mansfield, had changed too. For nearly six months he had been exclusively seeing one woman, who happened to be younger than Rinaldi but she says that didn't bother her. Okay, let's take a breather and compare the two. The woman slept with 12 other people. The husband slept with 1. THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT REDPILL LESSON ON THIS THREAD. Women always have more options than men in the dating world, so an open marriage is inherently skewed. By agreeing to one, you're agreeing to a built-in handicap. >She wrote: 'The turning point was hearing from Alden [one of the men she had slept with]. He sent me an e-mail, out of the blue, several months after the project had come to an end. Before long, we were having sex again. Being with him was exquisite. After reconnecting with Alden and falling deeply in love with him, there was no going back." >Robin says she's grateful for the experience of being married to Mansfield. "But for now," she continues, "For for this part of my life, I believe being with someone who is the most temperamentally like me is where I can learn more." I'm just gonna let this article sink in without any more analysis. Put simply, if you read this article and haven't decided to reject the concept of marriage, you are stupid. There is no benefit - none - for men that outweighs the risks. If your wife of 20 years one day decides she needs fresh cock, she can coerce you into an open marriage, sleep with 12 guys in Vegas, and then divorce your ass while leaving you with nothing but empty memories and half your wealth. How can you look in the mirror and call yourself a man after that? You get only one life. Do not waste it legally shackled to a female. Hypergamy and branch swinging is too powerful for men to control.Summary:
Summarize: Basically, I want to be more sure of what I say. I'm always questioning what I say long after I've said it. It's really irritating, and I know that the other person probably aren't focusing on what I've said as much as I have. But it still makes me self-conscious whether or not something I might have said could have changed that person's opinion of me in some way. I have trouble conveying my thoughts to people in public, and I think this has a lot to do with self-confidence or something (of which I'm sorely lacking at the moment, trying to work on it though). But basically, whenever I say something, I always worry that I'm going to say something stupid that will make the other person/people not like me.Summary:
Summarize: Let's start out with the boyfriend from two or so years ago who took photos of me and posted them on an adult website without my knowledge or consent. I discovered them a year ago today to the date. So that was major turning point in my trusting of men. Flash forward to Feb. I moved back to the city I used to live in to finish out my Masters (I graduate in December) and run into my friend that I have been friends with for 8 years (we have hung out on and off throughout those years while I lived in another state). He and I start dating that month. Then right before Memorial Day he disconnects, I don't hear from him pretty much since right before the holiday saying he needs a "break" makes me think of this [text message breakup]( so you can say I am just a little jaded. So start my month long writing class this June, new guy from class starts to really get into me. We hung out on Sunday to help him work on his paper, then he starts hitting on me, telling me he loves me, wants to date me. I have told him that I am really messed up from the past two relationships and explained I have black and white thinking. I really think he wants a booty call, though I am kind of down for it. I just think my emotions are a little screwed up right now. The weekend before we hung out I was a crying ball of hysteria. Part of me wants fun, but, I also don't want to fall into a 'rebound' and I am pretty much jaded with the last two relationships, the last boyfriend put the nail in the coffin for me. New guy it feels like there is some red flags. Our mutual friend tells me that he is one of the nicest guys he knows, only one mutual friend we had on Facebook. I have known this friend for 13 or so years, so I do trust his opinion. Just very confused and don't really want to rush it.Summary:
Summarize: So my roommate, we'll call her Hayley, has been dating this guy Trevor on and off for about a year. From the beginning, I got bad vibes from him because of his age, but I refrained from saying anything because he seemed to make her happy. (we've lived together about a year, but been friends since elementary school.) As time has gone on, I haven't felt any better about him. He's into "party" drugs ranging from weed (not worrisome) to class 2 narcotics (very worrisome) and recently was arrested for allegedly driving under the influence. Trevor tells Hayley he was just tired, but he had drugs in his pocket. He crashed his car, which is the second car crash he's had since they started dating. He lives in a similarly sized city to us about 2 hours away. So he calls Hayley all the time. We are close friends and roommates, so I am typically around when he calls. If we are out doing something, he complains that she doesn't love him enough if she tries to say she'll call him when we get home. Usually when she does convince him, he calls again in half an hour complaining that she hasn't called back yet. We often haven't finished our meal or shopping trip before he calls. He probably calls 8 times each waking day. Overall, I feel like he's manipulating her. One week he says he wants to be engaged within 6 months, then the next he says he cannot imagine being married within 5 years. Those sorts of things. I think it's bad news, and I don't know how to make her see how bad he is for her. I love her like a sister, and I'm worried she's setting herself up for a life of misery. He might be going to prison and she doesn't even see why she should break up with him if he goes to prison for half a year.Summary:
Summarize: Really good breakdown. One can only imagine how hard is to explain this in SoloQ or even to a 5v5 team made of friends. I often see this strategies in my head while the game is moving yet people always say shit like "Yeah, right. The Silver League Strategist!" and totally disregard my objections. There is more than one strategy to win this game, however the vast majority of players are not aware of this. They have a mindset, almost like a meta of a way a match is won. If I could change one thing in LoL e-sports, it would be the coach position; making it somewhat similar to soccer teams coaches. They are in the game and they are watching the game and they can make decisions while the game is in progress. How to apply it to LoL? Have a 5th player than can watch the players play on their computers (not the spectator stream with vision of all players, just his team) and make him a shot caller.Summary:
Summarize: I was 19, with two friends, and we decided to go smoke pot at a nearby park. I believe I had only smoked once before in my life, a few weeks earlier. I happened to be driving on this occasion, and was not too keen about smoking in my car. We got out, and each smoked enough, probably lucky that we were by a smelly trash pile. We were wondering where to put the weed, and I had my friend stash it in his pocket. Just then, a squad car pulls up. I guess we were there after the park was closed. We played it cool, and just at that point a second squad pulls up. They stand at their cars, with there headlights shining on us, for what seemed like 20 minutes. Meanwhile, we're standing there, pretending to have a conversation with animated gestures to show that we weren't nervous. Finally they came to my car, shined the flashlight around inside it, told us we were free to go. The one officer leaves, the second backs up and just waits for me. I had never driven a car stoned at this point, so I was scared as fuck, but pulled it off like a pro.Summary:

Summarize: The reason why he is coming back to earth is because he knows the Toronto Maple Leafs will win Game 6 today, and he needs to be on earth to witness them come all the way back and beat the Boston Bruins in Game 7. As one of Leafs Nation's most famous members, he has a job to do, and certain precedents to set. Leafs fandom trumps everything, including doing ground-breaking experiments and important research in space that could potentially benefit all mankind.

Summarize: _- I live a normal life and have the same beliefs of any other muslim. So I was right about generalizing. You admit that your argument was bullshit and your downvotes unjustified. > Second, you are still trying to stereotype muslims as murderers No, nobody here even remotely did that. That's a straw man. Good job proving how fulll of shit you are and everyone supporting your position. >Mohammad (peace be with him) would not approve of any of the current day extremists that exist. No true scotsman. Hey, guess what: Other people think Mohammad would not approve of your shitty face and cut your head off. And considering Islam's history that is the more realistic assumption considering Mohammad was a child-fucking warlord that ordered people's death throughout his life. And no, that is not a biased and unfair interpretation that's literally what he was and you can read it in your little holy book. It's sad that you are delusional enough to ignore all the shitty parts of your religion. But guess what: If you don't believe fully in the Quran you are not a Muslim. Quite obviously you disagree with what's written in the Quran, so why call yourself Muslim? You are simply not. I'm pretty sure many of the things you do are contradicting the Quran. For example: Do you treat women as equals? Because the Quran tells you not to. The Quran explicitly and undeniably tells you to command them and hit them if they disobey you. > If you want to talk about Muslims learn something about them that isn't in the news, and isn't a biased, anti-religion source. You mean the Quran? You mean history? >That is where you will get the correct information, and not contorted, taken out of context quotes. I think you are the one who has incorrect and distorted information. You are the one cherrypicking. If you actually thought critically about your religion you would abandon it because it's vile filth. It's sad that non-Muslims often are more informed about Islam than Muslims. Usually because they actually figured out that it's bullshit and therefore choose never to become Muslims.Summary:
Summarize: Those who frequent RDD on indiaspeaks will know what this post is about but still allow me to fill you in about what went down last night. There i was in RDD where hyodo wrote something about prophecies and fortune tellers, so i commented "whats my future in this sub?" to which another user asked for a pic of my palms. Now pls to note, i didn't know this user has the mental capacity of a retarded 3 year old who will get so so so offended by a pic of jizz in someone's hand that he will go and cry to the mods about how its "sexual harassment". WHAT THE FUCK! You're terming a pic which i posted just to elicit some laughs with no malice in my heart towards you as sexual harassment? The pic was taken down within 5 minutes of me posting it and i also apologised to the mod as well for not tagging it as NSFW. Still nothing to lose my shit over even though this guy accused me of sexual harassment . But then this assole instigates me by telling another user what a loser i am. So its not just enough that he accuses me of a serious crime like sexual harassment but he also wants to bash me on the thread as well,main chutiya toh hun nahi ki iski sunnunga so i hit back at him all the while trying to be a a little civil(at first) but ofcourse like the child he is, he retorts back with "randi madarchod..feed your jizz to your mom" Umm, so this is not as offensive as the pic i shared? Considering its not r/bakchodi. So fast forward a few minutes and this guy goes on to write one long ass para basically telling me that my parents hate me,my friends dont like me, how im a "piece if shit" punk teenager blah blah, but what really got his goat was that he failed to rile me up and even got called out on his remarks by another user. This fucker goes to town about how he was "offended",how it was sexual harassment, how it was some user who uses different alts to harass him etc etc. and he not only messages all the mods but also keeps telling all other users this through PM. Pls to note while all of this is going on, im still clueless about it. Its only this morning when a mod messaged me that i got to know the whole story. And if it hadn't been for this mod, i would've already got banned without so much as hearing my side of the story. Pls to note again,the pic was taken down within 5 minutes so majority of the people have no idea what it was and this fucker(crybaby) takes full advantage of this and tells everyone that it was a self taken pic(implying i jerked off,took a pic and then posted here) and everyone just laps it up. Pitch forks were out and they wanted to ban me all based on hearsay and what this "offended" little fucker told them. Isko toh randia ka mod bnao bhaiyio, apt hain. Gets offended easily, is quick in reporting to mods and obviously a chutiya.Summary:
Summarize: It seems like people really don't give a fuck about pulling their bright ass phones out anymore. People have no shame. Story time. I was seeing G R A V I T Y in an AMC which I paid like $16 to see in Ultimate IMAX Ultra-High-Def Real2D Whatever, and there was a guy who was on his phone for about 60% of the film. He's sitting in the front section so just about everybody can see him. Now, I can't say I never use my phone in a movie theater. But I'll only pull it out when it's really important (RunPee is awesome), when I have [Lux]( running so my screen is super dim, the phone is angled toward my body so nobody behind me can see it, and even then I'll only use it for 10 seconds max because I feel guilty, because I'm a human with human feelings and empathy and whatnot. Anyway, this dude kept pulling out his phone which I swear was designed to compete with a supernova, texting and surfing the web and whatever else. And kept it out for prolonged periods of time. About 1/3rd into the movie, a girl goes down and talks to him. I can't hear what they say, but she comes back up and the guy still has his goddamn phone out. When the movie ends he's still on his phone, so I go down to talk to him. I can't say I remember the exact conversation but I basically said "so you just pissed off a theater full of people who just wanted to see a movie, are you proud of yourself?" And his response was "yeah whatever dog".Summary:
Summarize: True, snow tires suck when it's cold, even without snow or ice, but if you don't deal with those (like if you live in a desert), just cold weather, then all-seasons would be a much more reasonable purchase than winter tires. On dry or wet, but not icy, 40 degree roads all-seasons will have more grip than winter tires.Summary:
Summarize: I started SS a week ago. I'm 6'5, 185lbs and I've always fucking hated squats; however, I'm going whole hog into SS and I've spent a lot of time on the wiki researching form. Being 6'5, I have alotta back and, since getting a desk job, it's gotten pretty weak: I definitely want to strengthen it to prevent injury later on. My first day, I worked out to find a 3x5 baseline and only got to 100lbs squatting (but 115lbs bench). The next 2 workouts were wonderful: I was doing great, lower back was tight and hip drive was good, worked up to 150lbs (following suggested 10-15lbs additions). However, on friday, I stopped feeling sore in a "hurts so good" kinda way and more of a "hold up" kinda way. I go to the gym today and same story, but it definitely impacted my form in a bad way. I've been looking around and I'm pretty sure I have Anterior Pelvic Tilt. How should I go about this? I feel like a good hip drive with APT makes things worse. Should I lower my weight, or stop squatting and address APT directly? Exercise ball over office chair? I'm all sorts of confused for this one. What should I do?Summary:
Summarize: So I've been in brave before back when you lived in lowsec. I joined up with bovril briefly but didn't get along too well (grr bubbles) but gave it a little go. I kind of miss you guys and I'd like to give it another try. Due to time constraints over the next few weeks I'm holding off applying until after Christmas. This should give me enough time to get a laid back market thing going on an alt to give me some income. The question is, is there anything I should be skilling into in the mean while? Is it possible to make a few isk to replace ships outside of srp? And what should I do with the dominix currently sat in hisec when I do join? I don't know if I want to go back to null because bubbles, is there any way around them?Summary:
Summarize: The difference is that here, tannuki have human intelligence, can take human form, and on numerous occasions have been shown to have no qualms with fighting. But then when a human tries to eat them, not only do they roll over and take it, but none of the humans except for one even know they are intelligent creatures. Even if they didn't want to fight, and god knows it wouldn't even be much of a fight, any one of them at any point could have simply barged in there and said "I am a tannuki. I own a house and vote and shit. Stop eating us, you assholes" and that could have been the end of it.Summary:
Summarize: How am I insulting them? I am stating clearly that their philosophy is suboptimal and even simple logic proves it. Balance for the masses: Makes the balance for competitive play bad (unstable, strict meta, boring, loopsided, plagued by the same issues again and again), makes the balance for all other demographics... Also bad. The demographics - how many million players, again? - are so numerous, different, their wants and "needs" so volatile, change day to day... You can't balance specifically with them in mind. It's a self-defeating task. Balance for competitive play/the pros: Makes the balance for competitive play good, makes the balance for all other demographics... Also good. How? Simple, everyone else adapts. They don't know any better. Some will still bitch and complain, but still play. Some won't even notice that the balance is being aimed at the pros, they will merely keep playing, not notice anything different and just "adapt". Meanwhile the pros get a more stable yet less constricted playing field to work with, more viable Champions... Speaking of which, funny that you mention J4 possibly being too strong (I don't even want to entertain the notion that Vi is too strong) and that they should nerf them, as the outliers . No, of course not. Why the hell would you nerf them?!? J4 isn't oppressive, neither is Vi. They don't deserve nerfs. Useless Junglers with outdated kits deserve buffs. Weak and forgotten Champions require partial or full remakes, some others simply need numerical tweaks. The fact that you think they need nerfs is... Well, it shows that you do think like Riot. "Boo hoo, if we do that, power creep, bla bla" - standard excuse with no justification. No one is saying that, if you buff other junglers now, that you will then buff J4 in the future, then the others again, and thus enter a vicious cycle. That doesn't make sense. It's basically a "slippery slope" fallacy. That would never happen... Some Champs only need a single set of buffs/remakes and that is it. From then on, you tweak them with small nerfs and buffs either way. The myth that this approach - buffing loads of weak Champs instead of constantly nerfing the "outliers" - would cause a power creep is laughable, baseless. It would imply that Riot are morons (which I don't think they are); there is no other scenario bar them being stupid where such an approach would fail. If anything there is a negative power creep going on right now (for ages, really) due to the way they have been balancing, via nerfing the "outliers"; especially with constantly removing/nerfing CC and non-skillshot abilities as well. Not to mention the always present mobility creep. Do they do anything about the mobility creep? Of course not. God forbid they add Cripple (the form of CC originating in Smite) and make other Summoner Spells more powerful to quell the prevalent nature of Flash. That would be too hard, despite the fact that it would improve every aspect of the game without hurting its core identity. Meanwhile - and these are outliers* - they constantly release broken Champions. Azir? Far too strong, despite squishiness. Rek'Sai? Badly designed Champion, simply far too weak... That everyone picked and banned because of her ridiculous damage output that got nerfed within 2 patches. No one notices that though, and, soon, she will fall into obscurity until she (like many others should) receives a minor remake akin to Sejuani's. Kalista? Do I really need to say anything about her? I'm sitting here trying to think of a weakness... But, no, me calling her broken (in the standard OP way) got ignored, got downvoted... And then NA LCS happened. "Oh wow she is so OP".Summary:
Summarize: I've know a few people who this happened too. Their family disowned them and completely broke contact, one kid hadn't seen or herd form any relative for 7 years. I met most of them when I was in college and every signal one of them were fucked up. They were all horrible people that were well on their way to being sociopaths. Their empathy for others feelings where gone or was ignored, even purposely hurt. When they learned that nobody in their family truly loved them and were just broken and now permanently angry at the world. The worst were the ones who joined the military to ensure that they could never act on their "urges".Summary:
Summarize: So today was yet another work day for me, 8 hours of cashiering, hooray! Luckily, today was a Wednesday, and so things were pretty calm. This particular story didn't happen till the last five minutes of my shift, in fact. A female customer came in (I'll call her Annoying Woman, or AW) about five minutes before I needed to pull my cash drawer and clock out. She was carrying a sale ad (that just went out yesterday), and was looking for the American flag that was on sale. I informed her of its location, and also made sure to tell her exactly which flag was on sale to avoid any further confusion. At this point, she was a bit snappy with me, but nothing I'm not used to. I figured she'd just be one of those customers you dread having to ring up, but that it'd be no worse than usual. I was wrong. She came up to my register a minute before I needed to pull my drawer, and informed me that we were out of the flags she wanted. Now, this is partly because the flags are very popular (what with Memorial Day and all) as well as the fact that they were featured front page in our last sale ad as well (so two ads in a row). Now, I didn't know we were out until AW informed me: "You're out of those flags I wanted!" My planned response was: "Oh okay, I'm sorry about that ma'am, can I get you a raincheck for them?" However, all I got out was "Oh, okay." Before she cut me off: "No, it's NOT okay!! I wanted that flag!! Why are you even out anyway?????? The ad just came out yesterday!!" I was pretty startled, because I didn't think she'd be that upset, and I definitely didn't expect her to cut me off before I could even finish my sentence. I felt (and still feel, to be honest) a bit bad because I try really hard to be upbeat, kind, and friendly to every customer, and it sucks that she just assumed I was happy or something about her not being able to get the item she wanted. Anyway, I responded to her with something like, "I'm sorry ma'am, the flags were in the ad before this one, and they're very popular. Can I get you a raincheck?" She wanted to buy something else, and I did get her a raincheck. I wasn't rushing her at all, but I knew I needed to pull my drawer (the owner will get upset if we clock out too far past the scheduled time for our shifts to end), so I was trying to end the transaction as smoothly as possible. And then she grabs one of our magazines. Now, we're a fairly small store, but we partner with a warehouse that has thousands of items. We do not stock all of these items, but we can order them. The magazines show items we don't carry in the store, and I am not very familiar with the contents of the magazines other than knowing what we do and do not have on hand. Anyway, she grabs a magazine and starts asking me questions about a certain bike. We don't stock bikes in the store, other than cutesy display bikes, so at first I thought she was referring to those. I told her this, and then she demanded that I call someone up to answer her questions. I did that while she continued to insist that I was wrong about the bikes in the magazine (I was, but it wasn't as if I'd insisted I was right. I just informed her that we don't stock bikes in the store, she'd have to order it). One of the guys came up to answer her questions, and I quietly pulled my drawer and walked away.Summary:
Summarize: I feel that you guys are giving way too much hate about russians. Everytime I get into a match and a russian opens his mouth, everyone goes bananas and mock him. If he chokes and fails to kill one, everyone put blames on him. Always complain the russians. I've met countless russians who have been very cooperative, some can be ragey and some can be very very ignorant. A couple of weeks ago, I was playing nuke and I had 3 russians and 1 dude(forgot the name of the country). It was 6-0 to the enemy team and this dude was sure angry about the russians because they barely got any kills and they haven't said a single thing, he sure complained a lot to the enemy team, then he asked me how I felt about them, I told him "I don't dislike russians but I dislike people who won't communicate". All the russians started to communicate we won the match easily, the dude never said a single bad word about them. If you guys always complain and put the blame on the russians, of course they will perform super bad, they get frustrated every match and no one is willing to give them a chance. This way they will never improve. It's not only the russians, this whole rage, toxic thing applies to everyone. Some people screams/mock them because they can't speak english. For fuck sake people, give them a fucking chance because they're trying at least. This will only destroy their confident and they will never try to talk in english again.Summary:
Summarize: This is me with tequila. Had been dating a girl for a short spurt of time. Every date we went on she acted more than impressed with my charm and intellect. One night of heavy drinking ended up with me pinching her friends asses, smacking her face into a door frame as I abducted her from the beer pong table. Repeatedly asking her to show my friends her boobs. Along with a list of other regrets I won't go into. Needless to say she wouldn't talk to me for weeks. When I saw her some time later at a party; I apologized for everything and she took me up stairs and slept with me.Summary:
Summarize: Hi, so my gf and I ran into a rough spot today. We've talked about it extensively and found that our problem is two-fold: She has very high expectations of how anyone in her life should behave, which is really "What would I do?" But no one else has her past experiences/upbringing, so her expectations almost are never met, both from me and from her friends. I've never had a lot of common sense. I do things and say things that go against common sense (my fuckup today was answering an unexpected door bell without asking who it was). This can sometimes be innocuous, but other times can lead to dangerous situations that would affect her and I negatively. We are moving to a bigger city, supposedly Atlanta, soon (I go up in August, she joins me after fall semester completes). With this big step in our future looming, she's not sure that I can protect her if I do dumb things that can jeopardize our safety. I fell back on being defensive during our discussion this morning and said she was being paranoid, but she and I both know that erring on the side of caution doesn't make one paranoid. So, my question is: how do we manage her expectations better and how do I get common sense? There's got to be somewhere in the middle. Since we've identified the problem, we just want help identifying the solution(s).Summary:
Summarize: I saw the second one recently and was extremely disappointed, I skipped through some of it because the dialogue was just so so bad, I understand that it's a kind of mick take of action films, but pretty much most lines are cliché 'action film dialogue'. And some of the throw backs to previous films are down right fucking terrible, one that comes to mind is when Arnie states for the 100th time- 'I'll be back', Bruce Willis retorts 'you've been back enough, I'll be back '- that's not too awful, but then Arnie follows it with something ridiculous like 'yeesh yippee ki yay'. I was just shocked at how far it fell from the first one which had some genuinely entertaining dialogue moments- as well as a more interesting story.Summary:
Summarize: So, more happened today... The not understanding owner came in and yelled at me about a blog post. In case I did not say so before: all employees are now required to contribute to the blog. The post he was yelling at me for is in regards to The Last of Us. Someone made a fan film, and my post referenced while referencing and plugging upcoming product releases for the game. It was labeled Not Suitable For Work in the blog entry. I had sent the entry a day earlier to someone at our secondary location to examine and post if it was found to be suitable. The Walking Dead Season 4 trailer had been posted a week before, and there was no tag for that. Lol He accused me of making jokes about the incident and how he handled it and of making light of a settled situation, despite the fact that it is not settled. He then went into the back room. He came out later and asked me about the printed copies if the e-mail the manager had sent. Now, these e-mails had been inside my personal lunch bag. I believe that by going into my lunch bag, he violated my personal privacy. He brought my status as a Christian into play and accused me of being nitpicky about the manager's behavior, as he is human and allowed to be cold and unprofessional to me after what he did. He asked me if I was considering litigation, and I DID lie about that. I did not like doing it, but I did not want to throw my lawyer under the bus. He left after stating that both the manager and myself would be receiving warnings, and he said there would be a meeting tomorrow at noon between him, the other owner, the manager, and myself. I cannot attend this meeting. It is at the start of my shift, and I view this as an intimidation tactic. I have called and left a message with my lawyer and am praying for the best.Summary:

Summarize: Summary: Branch swinging is embedded in the female DNA. There's no getting rid of it. Even if she marries you, the hypergamy reins supreme and she will always, ALWAYS be looking for a better man. [Full article here.]( I didn't know whether to laugh or cry after reading this article, which first caught my eye on Yahoo News' frontpage. Laugh because it proves every damn thing we say on TRP, or cry because society has devolved to the point where female hypergamy is just seen as a cutsey little thing that men have to shrug, accept and live with. An article celebrating cheating and hypergamy on the front page, for Christ's sake. Anyway, I digress. Let's dissect it... >We think it's fair to say that every married gal gets a little antsy on occasion and Robin Rinaldi, author The Wild Oats Project, is no exception. But unlike those of us who simply wonder what it would be like to take a break from our husbands — Rachel and Ross style — Rinaldi actually acted on it. >After being hitched to her spouse, Scott Mansfield, for 18 years, she made the critical decision to enter into a year-long open marriage so that she could experience life (and by life we mean sex) with other people. And by open marriage, I assume you mean banging Chads around the world while hubby gets to stay home and water the lawn and cook dinner. Is my assumption correct? Let's read on. >Rinaldi, 51, who lives in San Francisco, says that she and Mansfield, a brewer and wine-maker, were "stuck in a rut." She told the New York Post, "Our once-a-week sex life was loving, but lacked spontaneity and passion." I.e. life with a beta. The woman will sigh and spread her legs out for him once a week or so just because its her wifely duty, but beta males don't arouse any passion or excitement. Women love uncertainty. They love danger. A doting husband is the opposite of that. >But, unimaginative sex isn't what convinced Rinaldi to try her experiment, and ultimately write a book about it. She says that she finally reached a breaking point in her early thirties when she realized that despite years of pleading, Mansfield would never be willing to have a child with her. >She wrote in The Wild Oats Project, "I refuse to go to my grave with no children and only four lovers ... If I can't have one, I must have the other." She had her beta husband but couldn't put the ultimate lockdown on him - kids. Growing frustrated, she realized that she had made a huge mistake settling for this subpar male while her body was going baby-crazy and needed an alpha to impregnate her. >"I reached a point that a lot of us face in midlife where I was about to have an affair. I knew I was going to cheat, or we were going to get a divorce and something had to change. And I figured if I was going to do it, I was going to be fair and give him the freedom. I knew it was a long shot," she explains. Bolded emphasis mine. Observe the brutally honest female, admitting that all of her girlfriends have thought the same thing. It's almost refreshing that this woman is so open about the fact that women cheat and lie. Usually the feminist-types try to hide this fact. >And now for the terms: Rinaldi rented an apartment where she lived from Monday through Friday. There she was allowed to court as many suitors as she liked. On the weekends, she returned to her husband and they lived like a happily married couple without asking each other what or who they did during the week. >"It wasn't as strange as you might imagine. I liked it. It was the perfect balance, living on my own during the week and then returning home," she writes. "We had sex as always and the open marriage spiced things up — at least at first." >The few conditions were that they had to practice safe sex, could't sleep with mutual friends, and had to avoid "serious" relationships. Perfectly reasonable clauses, though they were all violated. >Rinaldi, who had been off the market for awhile, began her exploits by posting an ad on nerve.com. Within one day, she had 23 offers. >Her first paramour was a 40-year-old lawyer but she quickly moved on to younger men. She recalls texting her hubby goodnight from a Las Vegas hotel room immediately after a 23-year-old guy left her bed. >Over all, she had 12 encounters. Two were with women, one of them was a threesome. >After her trial year of condoned dalliances was up, however, Rinaldi and her husband struggled to make their marriage work. "Moving back home full time proved more difficult than I had thought. After you open up a marriage and experience a whole range of sexual variety and aspects of yourself you've never had before, it's hard to put everything back in the box. You're changed." >"Suddenly I found an updated version of myself. The person I was at 44 was so much different than the woman I'd been when I was last single at 26. She was less shy, more confident, wilder." >Mansfield, had changed too. For nearly six months he had been exclusively seeing one woman, who happened to be younger than Rinaldi but she says that didn't bother her. Okay, let's take a breather and compare the two. The woman slept with 12 other people. The husband slept with 1. THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT REDPILL LESSON ON THIS THREAD. Women always have more options than men in the dating world, so an open marriage is inherently skewed. By agreeing to one, you're agreeing to a built-in handicap. >She wrote: 'The turning point was hearing from Alden [one of the men she had slept with]. He sent me an e-mail, out of the blue, several months after the project had come to an end. Before long, we were having sex again. Being with him was exquisite. After reconnecting with Alden and falling deeply in love with him, there was no going back." >Robin says she's grateful for the experience of being married to Mansfield. "But for now," she continues, "For for this part of my life, I believe being with someone who is the most temperamentally like me is where I can learn more." I'm just gonna let this article sink in without any more analysis. Put simply, if you read this article and haven't decided to reject the concept of marriage, you are stupid. There is no benefit - none - for men that outweighs the risks. If your wife of 20 years one day decides she needs fresh cock, she can coerce you into an open marriage, sleep with 12 guys in Vegas, and then divorce your ass while leaving you with nothing but empty memories and half your wealth. How can you look in the mirror and call yourself a man after that? You get only one life. Do not waste it legally shackled to a female. Hypergamy and branch swinging is too powerful for men to control.Summary:
Summarize: Try to keep this as short as possible... I met my boyfriend, John, when he came to my small private school in the 7th grade. We immediately clicked (both came from poor/ broken families in a pool of rich kids) and became great friends, even flirting sometimes. Over the course of the year he asked me to be his girlfriend twice (I said no both times- he was kind of dorky and didn't want to get made fun of by my friends- also I had dated the popular guy for all of 6th grade, named Ryan). Still, we hung out outside of school, going to movies, etc. He stopped talking to me once it became Summer. In 8th grade he became much cooler, and had a lot of friends (friends i used to be friends with). I was a bit jealous. I heard he had "felt up" this girl, Aby, that I used to be good friends with. The rest of the year went by and I think he noticed me / had some interest in me but nothing like before. So begins 9th grade, and he asked out another one of my good/ best friends. They "dated" for just a few days... it was more just a stupid high school thing than anything. Months later, me and John became very close again. I had a lot of pursuers and got asked out by 3 guys. John finally asked me out again in January 2010. I said yes, very happy. He said "third time's the charm". Everything seemed perfect. We made love for the first time (each other's first everything) in the summer of 2010. He had gotten kicked out of my small private school, and was going to school for 10th grade an hour away from my house. We made it work till I got my license (I'm 9 months older). I believe the distance improved our relationship. High school went well together, but he was getting high from weed every single day (which i don't care about anymore since I do). But started molly, cocaine, acid, etc. This was a sporadic issue throughout. Fast forward to senior year. We were in a bit of a situation... I think we were both anxious about college and during spring break we went on a (kind of mutual) "break". I was still very depressed. We hadn't gone a day without talking in years. I hooked up with a few different guys (just kissing) that i knew from my small school. I just wanted to get out, etc after only being with one guy. After 2 weeks, I broke and texted him to meet up. We did. It was dramatic. I told him about 1 of the guys that I saw (couldn't muster up the courage for the rest) and told him we just kissed. He was insanely mad/ jealous. He was always crazy possessive jealous. Also, i told him that his best friend from my school (he hung with him every weekend of high school) and also my 6th grade fling Ryan, had texted me asking to come over and hook up. He went CRAZY. It almost ruined their friendship. About a month after our break, I found a picture of him cuddling with the girl, Aby, on a dark couch. I used to be friends with her they hooked up in 8th grade. When questioned he just insisted that he never did anything with anyone. Even though it was basically evidence right there. I was insane with anger but just put it aside. **Also- there was a girl he worked with whom I loathed. She was known as the town slut. Once when visiting colleges that year I saw some texts she sent to him "Hey sexy man" etc. I never did anything because I was so depressed/ crazy/ jealous/ didn't want to believe it. The break ended up making us stronger. He went to umass amherst in the fall, a party school. And I went to a small private girls school in boston for nursing.. Our first year was perfect. The distance/ recent break made us realize we were inexplicably in love. He drove to me (3 hours) every weekend. He even proposed to me drunk at a party and went ring viewing half heartedly one day. Also, this was the year that his mother's cancer came back. (She was very ill our whole relationship). We visited her at the hospital all the time. I knew things were not going to go well. At the end of freshman year in May, she passed away. My own mother died when I was young, so this was a tough time for both of us. We went home for the summer. Worked at the same restaurant. He decided to go to a community college in the Fall to stay home with Step dad and younger sister (whose father, not John's, abuses her). The year went ok for us. We have always fought a lot. Him not doing enough, etc. Stuff like that. He's always cranky, wants to "chill" and I want to go on dates. He also always burps/ farts infront of me and is just gross. I am health conscious vegan and he eats 5,000 calories of the worst food ever all day every day, which gets to me. We had a great 5 year anniversary very fancy date. Everything was "ok". This summer, my dad moved in with his girlfriend so i had no place to live so moved in with him since i usually stay at his place at home anyways. This is where things went bad. The first 2 months (may and june) were great. Then.. in july he started working 50-60 hours a week at a pizza place and loves it. (i don't get it. he doesn't need that much money at all and I don't work anywhere near that much). I just never see him. THEN, our friend Ryan came home from the army for 2 weeks. Our house was like a party frat house (even his step dad did coke with him and his friends) . One night... we got really drunk (I blacked out) and he had done a ton of adderall and was really drunk too. I woke up in our bed... and all of a sudden our friend Ryan was in our bed with another guy Fred (who also was long time friend from middle/ high school)... Fred started massaging my back playfully. I was naked but he covered me. My bf must have been getting turned on... because he started touching me / trying to fuck with his two friends in the bed.. I was still wicked drunk and went with it. THEN, all of a sudden he's like "suck their dicks" and i was like... what? But... being drunk and everything I hesitated and then did... with kissing/ other stuff... I woke Ryan up and had him join in too. I was so confused. But went with it... Then my bf started saying stuff the whole time (Next time there will be girls, etc...) And I was like No. (I'm jealous AF). but it went on. I had sex with Ryan. It was amazing. Made me realize how terrible sex with my bf was. He was kinda horrified and didn't realize the reason for the orgy with his basically married friends.... but it happened. And my bf watched and then fucked me after they were done. I was ashamed after this. All my friends told me to dump him. I tried breaking up with him 2 times... but was not strong enough. We talked about it a lot, and he said it was just a one time thing and that he didn't want to again..... But like... wtf? I even called a therapist I didn't know for an emergency phone session because I was going so crazy... Does he even love/ care for me anymore? The therapist said she wasn't even sure if he "ever did". I am going off to school in an accelerated nursing grad program and he is going back to umass in the fall. I have clinical on weekend and will see him sparingly. I am moving into an apartment in a crazy party area with my best friend (who hates John). *Also- the girl that he was on the couch with from the incriminating pic from 12th grade posted a photo of him on Instagram at a get together/ going away party for Ryan the army friend. I went ballistic but he said I was over reacting and that nothing ever ever happened. I love him, I really do... but I just don't know. I might just be young and blind... Our relationship hasn't even been good since then. All of his friends/ family say that I'm PERFECT and that he's beyond lucky to have me. Even at parties everyone asks "why are you dating that guy" ...I don't know. Also the drugs (mostly cocaine) have becoming more of an issue and I do know he has some addiction problems. I only do that stuff once in a wile. We have so much history.. do I really need to throw it all away? I don't know.Summary:

Summarize: Never posted before, using throwaway, posting from mobile. Until recently I was in a 4 year LDR with a wonderful girl I loved very much. Everything was fine until she got this new job about a year ago. It's a very demanding and consuming job, she had to move away from friends and family and live alone for it. Brutal hours, and impossible to take more than a couple days off at a time until, as she put it, she "works for several years to earn that much time off". She no longer had any time for me, and we had a fight. We didn't speak for two weeks, not even a text, and at that point I decided enough was enough. She had put zero effort in for a long while and that was the last straw. I ended things via text (our timezones/her work schedule made calling very difficult) and she read them but never replied. I figured she'd never talk to me again. Over the last year of my LDR I became close with a female coworker, but it was strictly friendship. I'll call her Jen. My ex was the jealous type and I knew it'd upset her so I never told her. I even never hung out with this girl outside of work until my relationship ended. I found out very quickly that Jen wasn't looking for a relationship, but did want to be friends with benefits. Aside from all of that she's also just a fantastic friend, and helped me to deal with my breakup in alot of ways. 6 weeks after breaking off with my ex, she texts me. She admitted she ignored our problems and neglected me, and realized her mistake after so many weeks of no contact. She said she missed me, her best friend, and said she didn't want to lose me as part of her life. She also said that maybe we could talk out our problems. I believe everything she said to be true. Later that same day, Jen invited me to come over to her place for sex later in the week (she's always been very upfront) and being single I of course said yes. I find Jen extremely attractive sexually, and am a virgin to boot, which she likes apparently (my LDR was sexually starved. Despite 4 years, we hadn't seen each other since she left for home and we never went all the way before that). Jen knows I had contact with my ex, but pointed out that I'm single and free to do as I please. Having talked to my ex over a few days it became clear that despite breaking up we still held strong feelings for each other. I told her about the dates I tried to go on and she said it was fine because we are not a couple... but eventually I got her to admit that, yes, it did bother her. She also thought that my talking about these girls, especially my new friendship with Jen (of which she is extremely jealous), meant I wasn't interested in being with her again. I told her I'd be willing to give it a shot, but only if she made some big changes or it could never work. She said she would seriously think about it. Now the fuckup. Last night I got drunk with the boys and stupidly decided to tell my ex I had sex since we broke up. It was a lie, but I wanted to know how she would react and if, despite what she said about not being a couple, it bothered her. I wanted to know what I was to her. And also, I did still have a fuck date with Jen lined up. Would she be okay with her now single ex fucking someone else? I wanted to know how she really felt. So I tell her this, and she says "she suspected the whole time" (despite it never happening..) and assumed it was Jen. She became upset and I, still drunk, decided that I should tell her the truth, that I'm still a virgin. Figured it'd make her feel better, whoops on my part. She got (rightfully) pissed that I was lying. I fucked that up, and she's thinking about what to do with me. I need advice. I can see myself having a future with my ex, I adore her and it could work if she's willing to make changes. But it is by no means certain that she will, even before I upset her when I was drunk. I'm asking for big changes she wasn't willing to make originally. Jen on the other hand isn't sure if she wants a relationship right now but does want to fuck around. If I decide to ignore the fuck request, it will likely offend Jen and possibly ruin an amazing friendship. But if I go through with it and my ex decides to give it another shot, then it would probably break her heart despite us not being a couple when it happened. Worst case is to not do it, and my ex decides not to try again, ruining both relationships. I'm going to see Jen tomorrow. I need advice.Summary:
Summarize: Details _Vendor: [Top_Gear_UK] _Market: [Agora] _Product: [115ug LSD Tabs] _Shipped from: [UK] _Shipped to: [US] _Required FE: [YES] Rating _Communication: [N/A] (Not Needed) _Stealth: [9] / 10 _Shipping time: [10] / 10 _Price value: [10] / 10 _Aesthetics: [10] / 10 _Quantity: [10] / 10 _Transaction: [10] / 10 _Vendor: [10] / 10 _Drug: [N/A] TOTAL SCORE: [69] / 70 [Will update with quality after sampling] I was somewhat scared to order 50 tabs from a vendor with so much drama surrounding them, but you shouldn't spend money you can't afford to lose on DNMs, especially when dealing internationally. I'd also recently read a thread on here claiming TGUK was selectively scamming. I've also read of him shipping orders short, there was even one guy that claimed he got a single tab in the mail (why would a vendor bother to ship a single tab?). I went in understanding this, but deemed the value worth the risk. BlueViking was on vacation following a sale, and TGUK had awesome prices. He was running a "Get 20% Extra" sale at the time. I read on his FAQ that "Free tabs are ~70ug". So I thought I'd get my 50x 115ug, and then some freebies that were underdosed and he needed to get rid of somehow. In fact I got a full 60x regular 115ug blotters. Stealth is adequate. You're shipping an odorless sheet of paper in the mail... what do people want from a vendor? You don't need 5 layered moisture barrier bags and vac sealing. That would make it more suspicious, not less. I have not sampled this substance, so I cannot speak on potency. Even if the tabs are only dosed at 60ug, then I still got a better $/ug ratio than ordering from some other vendors. If someone else wants to foot half the bill (is bitcoin groupfunding/escrow a thing?) then I'll donate a tab to testing via EnergyControl. Are there any labs that do what EnergyControl does, but cheaper/free? Also, just a side-rant. But why the fuck does everyone rate vendors when they FE? "FE'd for trusted vendor" doesn't help me. Do people not realize you have like 6 weeks afte ordering to review, you don't have to initially review? If no one reviewed until their pack did/didn't land that'd make sorting through Agora reviews a LOT easier...Summary:
Summarize: I'll be honest mate, I have a large penis (7inch and thick) and I gotta say, it isn't all it's cracked up to be. I'll never have anal, getting oral is too big a task for all but the skankiest women (not my cup of tea those gals), and even vaginal intercourse can be too hard for them. I say we are in similar boats, we are both afraid of our dicks. Just do what I do. Be gentle, carress, get her into it. If she is aroused, all the nerve endings down there will be happy with any stimulation.Summary:
Summarize: Freshman year- My Gf and I had been out most if the night at a friends apartment making weed butter and then a bunch of edibles. Between all the butter that had gotten on us while we cooked and all the edibles we ate we are both sky high. We get back to my on campus apartment, nobody's home. My three roommates all stumble in loudly about 30 mins later drunk as hell, they had been a some party. We are sharing the stories of our nights when we suddenly hear a shriek from outside. We are all fucked up so none of us really react until we hear a girl running down our hall screaming "help help!" Me and my four roommates all rush outside, my gf and a couple other girls stay behind in the room. We get in the hall and this panicked girl is just sayin"upstairs upstairs please you guys have to do help!" We are all way too fucked up to know what to do so we all just bolt for the stairs and run up to the third floor. We throw open the door to the hall to just see the walls covered in blood. Like fucking everywhere in HUGE streaks across the walls and big semi-soaked in puddles on the carpet. Despite being high as shit I am the most sober one of the four of us so i took the lead and ran towards this writhing body on the ground, then notice there is a girl crying hysterically nearbye and some shirtless dude holding her. This kid we all knew is just in a heap on the floor, he has this massive gash on his head that is just hemorrhaging blood and there is this huge rock like two feet to his left covered in blood. So I grab the kid and using what training I can remember while I'm so fucked up my roommates and I try to to talk to him and carefully rolled him onto his back. Although the whole time he keeps trying to sit up and grab at the rock while making this just like guttural moan. " Jack (not his real name) what's going on?" "Unnnnnggggg" "Jack come on dude speak to me what the fuck happened." "Unnnnngggggg" roommates:"Steve what do we do?!?" "Shit, well if he can't communicate we don't have a choice call 911" (bear in mind we all liked this kid and new that if we called the paramedics and cops this would be it for him at school) roommates look at me hesitantly but say" alright FUCK" So roommate A runs off to call for help while B,C, and I try to piece together what's happening while stopping the blood from gushing out of jacks head. Shirtless dude" we were watching a movie and suddenly we hear a knock on the door, Girl went to answer it and as soon as she opened the door this crazy fucker just decked her in the face!" Although he didn't elaborate more we were never sure how much of the damage on jacks body was dealt by shirtless guy but I have no doubt it was more than a little. While he is telling this to roommate C I am looking jack over and that's when I look in his eyes to see they were dark red and had pupils the size of dimes" FUCKING SHIT! He's high out of his god damned mind!" Turns out elsewhere on campus earlier that night jack had eaten several candies laced with LSD and was tripping his balls off. So anyway at around that point two cops, one of which I had a bit of a history with suddenly burst into the hallway guns drawn. We all throw our hands up as we are being aimed at and so jacks head starts gushing more blood. "What the fuck is going on?!" Dick cop yells "Don't shoot! We found him like this, he needs attention now! Also I think he's on drugs because he is completely nonresponsive, and keeps trying to hit himself with that rock!" I shouted gesturing to the big bloody stone. The cops thankfully lowered their guns and holstered them but then dick cop pulls out his taser and starts threatening jack with it ordering him to get down and comply or be tased. Roommates B,C,and Start yelling" No STOP! He doesn't understand what your saying let us just hold him down he's fine he just needs medical attention!" "Back away from him NOW!" So we all stood up, pretty well covered in blood, and did as he said. Jack pulled himself towards the wall and leaned against it but roommate B grabbed the rock and moved it away from Jack, who still kept reaching for it and the cop kept threatening to taze him if he kept moving, not that jack understood. Eventually the paramedics arrived and carted away Jack, and treat the girl who got a huge black eye. Never heard from jack again personally but B did and he said that according to Jack he had no recollection of how he wound up in our building or why he punched the Girl, but that he kept hitting himself with the rock because he saw it as his brain and was scared if he didn't get it back into his head he would die. So ya that was the craziest thing I saw in college although I do have some other good stories as well. Always remember kids, drugs can be fun, but they can also be very very VERY dangerous.

Summarize: Final Fantasy XII. Not for the obvious "gambits r dum" argument: I agree with a point that I believe PA's Gabe made back when the game first came out: FF games essentially played themselves anyway. At least when it comes to random encounters / "trash mobs", when I played an FF game I would set the menu system to "remember last selected" and just mash X after the first battle has setup for the enemies in the area. If you rely on gambits for boss battles in FFXII, you will die. You need to take manual control and - for example - start a heal or summon when you see the boss charging up a large spell. Gambits take away the chore of FF games, for me anyway. I could run around and enjoy the areas and lore without having it broken up by random battles every x steps, waiting for the battle transition, mash X for a while, wait for the end battle animations and xp/loot screen, rinse and repeat. It made the game much more fluid and natural-feeling. My large gripe with XII was the story direction. Originally, Square wanted Basch to be the main character but they changed it to Vaan partway through development because of something about effeminate younger male leads selling better. But the story seemed like it was still written as though Basch was really the hero, and I really wish they would have kept him. Vaan (and by extension, you as the player) runs through this world doing things he doesn't really understand the true ramifications of, for reasons that are entirely over his head, and with a truly insipid motivation (GONNA BE A SKY PIRATE HADURR). He never has anything interesting to say - in fact most of his lines are played for comedy of the "kids say the darndest things" variety. He never has any meaningful input as to the progress or direction of the quest. He is, in essence, just tagging along with the real group of heroes. Unlike most other FF games, the game isn't about the main character; in fact, the main character just feels kind of optional, like Yuffie from VII. Like the whole quest could have happened without them having ever existed. XII seems unsure of where it wants to go with this. They could have played up the "naïve kid tagging along with the important people" angle, letting the player piece together the geopolitical conflict from snippets of conversation Vaan overhears. The game does this some of the time: Vaan kind of standing around the group huddle while they decide what to do next. But then it will also focus on conversations that Vaan isn't even a part of. Or the conversations will be about something integral to the plot that was never explained, and will never be explained.Summary:
Summarize: The Elder Scrolls games are all single player RPGs centred around the player character... They're very much about you exploring the world on your own and discovering things while being immersed in said world, feeling like you are the first player to have done so... Not to mention your growth into being the most powerful individual around capable of fucking up everyone else's shit. That does not translate at all into an MMO by virtue of the fact that now you've got thousands of player characters running around. The exploration aspect is watered down because you're not the only player character in the world to discover it, and then everyone else is equally growing in power, so you no longer have that aspect of uniquely being this powerful motherfucker unmatched by anyone else.Summary:
Summarize: Hi Guys! I've been thinking a lot lately because im tired of smurfs in my games. I hate it when smurfs are "ruining" my games, both on the enemy team (obviously), but also on my own team. If you guys have played WoW (World of Warcraft) you will know a system they had with BoA(binds on account) items. You could purchase them in max level, and they gave your alt (like a smurf), a xp boost so that you could level up quicker. I feel like this could be i implemented in LoL. If when you reached max level, you would be able to buy a scroll or something (975 rp, 6300 ip) which made it so you would only get queue up with smurfs, and gave a xp boost, so that smurfs would level up a lot faster, and was bound to only your account. I'm not sure how many percentages it should give, and how much the price should be, but i just thought i would be a great idea. Obviously it would mean a longer queue time, but it would make games fun both for the smurfs, but also for the low level players, who is all new at the game.Summary:
Summarize: My boyfriend and I have been together a good minute now, met last August, instantly clicked. He's amazing and I want things to work out between us and they do! We get along amazingly. I adore every thing about him. Our sex life has become an issue for us both. He has an extremely small penis. NOT THE PROBLEM! I don't even care. Normally, sex is important to me but I am so turned on by everything about who he is that, for once, I can honestly say sex isn't even relevant. Good, bad, or ugly, I still want him. However, it has become more than obvious that he has visible insecurities with his size. His insecurities make me uncomfortable, not his penis. The longer we are together, the more he makes it into an impending issue. I DON'T CARE! I just want intimacy with him but he is so insecure about himself that we can't enjoy each other. I was shocked the first time we had sex, I'll admit, but was relieved and comforted by how okay he was. That put me at ease and we had awesome sex several time.... merely, several. Since god damned August. I googled and read about positions for smaller men, sought advice through the internet from women with similar experience... the whole nine. I never wanted what was noticeably an obstacle to become one. I love him and I want him, completely. As time passes, he is less and less affectionate and extremely rarely willing to be intimate with me. I can't even figure out how to initiate any sort of sexual behavior with him, anymore. It's as if we are only friends. I don't want to be friends. I want him to be comfortable and just be with me. I know he desires me; I feel like I am banging my head against the wall here. He has recently started making self-degrading statements about himself when I try to initiate sex or even messing around together. He'll hardly even make out with me. When I feel hurt by that and kind of back off a little, he goes above and beyond to keep me. So what the fuck? I don't want a completely sexless relationship. I can't be happy with that. Penetration isn't a huge deal; there are endless ways two people can find pleasure together. I really care about him and want us to have a nice relationship WITH sexual activity.... I feel like we are just becoming friends and I hate it. What the hell can I do/say to make him comfortable??? f-27 m-31 Please help me reddit.Summary:
Summarize: She talked to me a few months ago and I told her I was newly atheist when she asked if I believed in god. Today she approached me while I was eating lunch, with her friend by her side. She told me she had been worried about me and wanted to talk to me about jesus, so we talked for about ten minutes and then her friend (who hadn't said anything or even looked at me until this point) started to take over. He debated me for an hour and constantly brought up that strange "what are the chances that we even exist? there must be god" argument and I kept saying that the chances were RIDICULOUSLY HIGH. During this whole ordeal, the girl grew this look on her face like she wanted to cry. She thought I was going to hell and there was nothing she could do about it. She thought that I was denying the only true happiness in the world and she had failed to save me. I asked her if she was ok, and she could barely say no, I could hear the tears in her throat. I haven't told my parents that I am atheist for the same reason. I want her to be ok, I mean, she is seriously pretty. She cared about me enough to do something that obviously SCARED THE SHIT out of her, because it took her months, and I had to give her an experience that made her almost cry. What do you guys have to say about this? I feel like an asshole.Summary:
Summarize: Hello AskWomenAdvice. I've messed up, and I would appreciate some perspective on it. I'm going to change a couple of details so it's not too obvious who I am, and apologies for the wall-of-text, but I'm desperate. I (19m) have been seeing my girlfriend (20f) for about a year and a half now, and things have always been great. Like, really great. She's my best friend, and I can honestly say that not only have I never been happier in my life, but, as a deeply good individual, she's honestly made me a better person. We've been abroad together, we've been there for each other when we've been ill, we've laughed and cried with each other, we've met each others families, and nothing worse has happened before now than a few minor spats. Now, the fuck up. I went for a night out with my housemate (my other bestfriend), a female friend and a guy from work. We all got incredibly drunk, to the point I don't remember large portions of the night. Someone suggested we go to the strip club. I'd never been before this point, and I'm very uncomfortable as stripclubs (or, accurately, stripteases) was a major grey area in our relationships. We'd made jokes about it previously, but really I never expected to end up in this situation. So, I get in, buy a couple of drinks, and resolve not to do anything stupid. After a while, I notice my friends alternating between talking to one of the girls working there and pointing at me. I can't work out what is going on. Next thing I know, I'm being grabbed by the hand and pulled off, the girl insisting that, as it's my first time, I had to have a dance. I don't particularly want one, but I'm already being pulled away, and frankly I felt pressured into paying $20 for a 3 minute dance. It was deeply uncomfortable, but I'm not going to pretend I couldn't have out my foot down and stopped it. It gets worse. My girlfriend was going through some incredibly tough times at her work, to the point that she was one step from bursting into tears on me when I saw her the next day. I'd resolved to tell her about the night before, but I couldn't bring myself to do it. It honestly would've crushed her at a time she really needed support. So, I told myself I'd tell her at the next best opportunity. The next day, she was even more stressed with deadlines, and people hounding her to do this and that. Another case of turning to me for support. I couldn't tell her when she was already crying into my chest. She told me she'd feel fine after her deadline in two weeks time for a big project, but until then she'd be seriously struggling. And she wanted to have sex with me. Rock and a hard place. Do I tell her now and crush her when she's already under severe pressure? Or act as if nothing is wrong for the time being and tell her when she has less on her shoulders, even if it means some shady behaviour? I went for the latter option. I'm ashamed to say I slept with her during this time period. Yeah, I know, it's fucking horrible what I did. So, after this two week period, she invites me over. We chill out, have a chat, and I tell myself that now is the best time. I handled it badly - I wanted to get it off my chest and shoehorned it into the conversation. Worse, I panicked, and said some things I really regretted - I wanted to express that there was absolutely no desire or attraction to the dancer throughout, and that I couldn't even remember what she looked like. When she asked if the girl was better looking in a bit if dark humour, I repeated what I had heard from the others the morning after - that she was 'butters' and 'flat-chested'. Again, I panicked, and this is extremely out of character for me - enough that my girlfriend (an ardent feminist) now isn't sure that I'm the same person she thought I was, on top of not knowing if she can trust me. This is probably the thing I'm most ashamed of. Somehow she let me stay the night, and I agreed to attend her production the day after. I did, we met up afterwards, had dinner, and went out for a bit afterwards. It honestly felt like we were back to normal. She said she forgave me - albeit she didn't entirely trust me, or love me quite as much (more dark humour). We laughed a lot, joked, smiled, kissed, and said goodbye before heading home for a few days. Our messages went back to normal. Now, as of the last day or so, her messages have suddenly changed back to being short, sparse, and she's told me that she is still hurting (fair enough, I expected as much) and implied that she still isn't sure if she's ready to keep seeing me. This blind-sided me as I thought we were back on at least talking terms. I understand that she hadn't had much time to process the info, but it was quite a shock to see such a turn around. Here's the thing - I fucked up awfully. I. I acted badly, I handled it badly, and I followed through with it badly. My girlfriend means the world to me, and I'd give anything - literally anything - to turn back the clock a couple of weeks, put my foot down and say no. I guess I'm a lot weaker than I thought. I've made it very clear to her that I am deeply sorry, and that I'm willing to do whatever it takes to make our relationship work, including giving her plenty of time to think about what she wants to do. If she wants to break up with me, then fair enough; as she's a wonderful person who does not deserve such behaviour. But at the very least, I want her to know that, deep down, I'm a good person who made an awful mistake; the same person she's been in love with for the last year and a half, and that this monumental fuck up will never, ever happen again.Summary:
Summarize: About exactly a week ago I had sex and made out with someone I know, and just recently (in the last few days) they felt ill and went to the doctor because they thought they had the flu. The doctor told them they have mono. Obviously if I've never been exposed to mono, I might have definitely been infected. However, as far as I'm aware, I have not been infected in youth. Then again I wouldn't know. So what the fuck do I do? I can't afford to be taking off work at all because I recently took off a few days because I had the flu, and I'm new to the job. They'll kill me if I take any more days off. Also, i don't want mono! FmlSummary:
Summarize: Ok guys, so first I want to say thank you and big props for making this site. Even though I'm overwhelmed by the amount of information I'm really grateful. The thing is, I should be able to find stuff out on my own, I regard myself as tech savvy and my google fu is pretty decent BUT I'm stuck right now. Now english is not my primary language and even though I am pretty confident in a day to day setting I kinda need some guidance. I made this longer than neccessary. Anyways, my pokebag is full (350) and right now I don't have any money to upgrade it and with all the posts about max IV's and move sets going around I am afraid to transfer pokemon. Now to my question: With 350 Pokemon how do you efficiently decide what to transfer and what to keep? Do you just transfer the lowest CP? At what point do you regard a mon to have low CP? Second question, theres multiple resources and links about IV's and move sets and what not but are there 2-3 resources explaining IV's, movesets and so on from the very basics? Like what I'm trying to say is, is there a step by step basic guide about all the data that is available? Hope you guys get what I'm saying and sorry if I'm being a bit lazy, I really am not but I can't organize anything and I'm overwhelmed by the links. Thank you guys!Summary:

Summarize: Kind of not so funny story: I had to get a physical in high school to do sports, so I went to the big one we held once a year at the gym, where the majority of students went to get their physical. Basically they ask you a bunch of questions, pinch your skin, make you lie down, blah blah. Well, I was a skinny lass, so as I lay down on a hard counter so the lady could do I'm-not-sure-what by pressing on my abdomen, she frowned. She pushed deeper and deeper and asked me if I was constipated in front of a bunch of pretty blonde volleyball players without pants or shorts because they were in line for a nearby station. I told her no, so she asked more questions about my shitting and urinary schedules. She told me I had a hard ball inside. By this point, I'm burning red: I had never done sports before, but here I was trying to get cleared to do swim and water polo in front of these popular girls judging me as I talked about poop. The lady then told me to see a doctor to check out what was going on. We emailed my doctor, and she asked what side the ball was on. Well, it's on my lower left! And she replies that it's my back and that it's completely normal, I was just very skinny. (The reason she could feel my back from the left side of my body is because at the time I had moderately-severe scoliosis, but because to everybody's surprise it didn't affect my hips and shoulders too much, no one could tell unless I bent over.)Summary:
Summarize: I started SS a week ago. I'm 6'5, 185lbs and I've always fucking hated squats; however, I'm going whole hog into SS and I've spent a lot of time on the wiki researching form. Being 6'5, I have alotta back and, since getting a desk job, it's gotten pretty weak: I definitely want to strengthen it to prevent injury later on. My first day, I worked out to find a 3x5 baseline and only got to 100lbs squatting (but 115lbs bench). The next 2 workouts were wonderful: I was doing great, lower back was tight and hip drive was good, worked up to 150lbs (following suggested 10-15lbs additions). However, on friday, I stopped feeling sore in a "hurts so good" kinda way and more of a "hold up" kinda way. I go to the gym today and same story, but it definitely impacted my form in a bad way. I've been looking around and I'm pretty sure I have Anterior Pelvic Tilt. How should I go about this? I feel like a good hip drive with APT makes things worse. Should I lower my weight, or stop squatting and address APT directly? Exercise ball over office chair? I'm all sorts of confused for this one. What should I do?Summary:
Summarize: Last night was... wow. It's hard to even put it into words. My memory is all jumbled and there are certainly parts I'm forgetting, but here we go. So, basics: it's my first trip ever I made a tea with 1.75 g of cubes by using lemon juice and a strainer I haven't done any other drug except marijuana and even then very occasionally I hadn't had a meal for 6 hours beforehand my boyfriend who has tripped before was my sitter and helped me navigate my trip. We started out by watching an episode of Family Guy. I remember that I started laughing more and more at the jokes. I was waiting patiently for the visuals to happen. After a while, when I glanced at a portion of the wall or ceiling very quickly it shifted a little bit. I thought my mind was playing tricks on me possibly so I didn't pay much attention to it. A few minutes later, I notice that the wallpaper starts swirling around. It was the most beautiful thing I'd ever seen in my life. The ceiling, which is patterned, was moving quickly along the ceiling like a timelapse of a starry night sky. I sat there for the next hour and a half or so feeling incredibly euphoric. There was a permanent smile plastered onto my face. I laughed really hard for minutes at a time for no apparent reason, and I started crying at one point, I was so happy and laughing so hard. The body high felt amazing and it felt like my entire body was buzzing, like if I was laying on a big vibrating bed. I was having great closed eyes visuals of laying in a sunset, getting massaged at a resort, etc. I saw paintings and people in the wallpaper as it spun faster and faster and even glowed. My boyfriend then turned on Netflix and we watched Cosmos. It was amazing. However, my mind is sometimes uncomfortable with being drastically changed within a short amount of time (I had a panic attack the first time I smoked weed). I realized that slowly my mind and identity was slipping away from me. I had little to no knowledge on how to do anything. I attempted to use my computer, check my email, browse the web and look at pictures. My email was full of messages about work and college and things like that, but I felt like I was looking at these trivial human things that made no sense to me. I slowly lost my ability to use the computer at all. At this point, I stopped understanding my body and its signals as well. I didn't understand what hunger or having to pee felt like, and I almost peed the bed until I remembered. I felt like my body was a random vessel that my mind was carting around. My boyfriend escorted me to the bathroom and walking felt like using wobbly stilt legs because I forgot how to walk. I wanted it to end. I hated feeling like I was a little mindless baby or confused senior citizen. I never thought it was going to end. It took me ages to do simple little tasks. The world was spinning around me but I couldn't find beauty in it anymore because I was so confused about where and who I was. My boyfriend cuddled and kissed me when I started to cry out of fear and anxiety. However, after this, I understood that my trip was going to eventually end and that there was no use worrying about it. The rest of the trip was neutral. It felt like I was attempting to re-learn everything about me and my life and that I was navigating the world as a helpless baby. I tried fixing my makeup in the mirror and was fixated on the appearance of the face that I was born with. It didn't seem real that my face belonged to me. I played piano and was amazed at how somehow my memory remembered how to play certain songs. For the rest of the night, I would cry on and off as I realized certain things about my life that I had "forgotten" during my trip. Crying came suddenly and without warning, and I didn't realize how to make it stop when it did. Then, after a while the trip seemed to end as things stopped moving and I felt like I was returning to normal. I went to sleep (weirdly, my mind still felt like it was buzzing) and here I am now. I feel different right now, as if having to re-learn everything last night had some effect on the way I think and do things. The loss of identity was really disconcerting and surprising as I thought I had taken a relatively low dosage, but I guess you can never be sure. I feel like it was a good trip, but definitely not something I would do frequently or just for fun. At the moment I'm simply amazed by the ability of shrooms to completely take away everything you thought you knew. How were your experiences with identity and mushrooms?Summary:
Summarize: I'm currently doing a euro trip with 8 other friends. While we were in Amsterdam one of the girls had her drink spiked and was abducted. It was the most stressful experience of my life. I ended up bursting into tears with my best friend, and yelling out how disgusting the human race can be. Luckily a local got in contact with the abductees and convinced them to let her go. The police were fucking no hope at all.Summary:
Summarize: I'm a male, raised from dope house to dope house by an addict mother and a series of violent addict step-fathers. That wasn't traumatic enough I guess, so being a combat medic (I was told I would be a non-combatant, wouldn't have to carry a gun: perhaps there is some moral injury to my trauma as well) in the US Army sounded like a good idea (enlisted pre-Iraq war). Then Operation Iraqi Freedom kicked off and they sent me there. That wasn't traumatic enough (and all of my leadership told me the army was the only place for me and that I would fail in civilian life), so I re-enlisted to go back to Iraq a couple more times. That was finally traumatic enough for the Army at least, so they kicked me out on a pension and I went to college to study photojournalism. I studied photojournalism so that I could take pictures of just how traumatic war is, because I thought that it was important that everyone know just how traumatic war is. Thinking that I couldn't become more traumatized, I returned to Iraq, bouncing between there and Syria as a journalist and humanitarian aid worker. I was finally traumatized enough and decided to take a vacation in lovely Germany... However a working vacation, documenting traumatized refugees of the ongoing civil wars in Iraq and Syria. In Germany I met the woman of my dreams, literally. I'd had an image of what that girl was since I was 12 years old: dark skin, dark hair, and bright, sparkling personality. We fell in love quickly, and I gave up my obsession with constantly re-traumatizing myself, giving up my idea of being a war photographer. I decided to take a sabbatical and re-determine a course of life that could work with hers. During this sabbatical I began taking lots of psychedelic drugs along with her. I felt it was a cool new way of us bonding at first, but it just eventually became my escape from trauma. I would take drugs at every possible interval and would become emotionally volatile, especially to her. We live in a 36 square meter, one room flat on a loud party street. Tensions rose, especially when we couldn't afford drugs and partying. When we could, everything was great. Eventually we decided to marry, and did though we had only known one another and been together for a year and change. Fast forward a few months and a few massive panic attacks later, she convinced me to get off of drugs and seek therapy. I did and just recently received this diagnosis of Post Traumatic Personality Disorder, which from what I have read is supposed to be somewhere between Complex Traumatic Stress Disorder and Borderline Personality Disorder, coming from a lifetime of unchecked trauma. This diagnosis scares the shit out of me, and I'm hoping that I can overcome the supposed BPD portion of it. Every article I've read on BPD in males is so absolutely damning. I'm not looking for a mother. Though I've had a significant number of partners, romances and micro-romances, it is likely because I have been super busy in my life with little time for long-lasting relationships, I am happy with just this one amazing woman who is now my wife. I am guilty of thrill-seeking behavior and drug-abuse. I am impulsive. I am in so many ways way more "all or nothing" than what is within normal boundaries. My wife is driven mad and calls me a drama queen, to which I often sling back insults. I have cheated, as has she in a period where we had a very complicated open relationship. I have a plan for the road ahead at least: stay clear-headed, remain as stress-free yet engaged as possible, psychotherapy, couples therapy, medication as a stop measure for panic attacks and flashbacks, volunteer work until and perhaps even after I get my work permit for here in Germany, actual work, saving for a larger flat with more at least three rooms, structure, schedule, exercise, diet. I've considered also keeping a mood diary, and a log of things that I do that mimic Borderline symptoms. Does anyone have any idea as to what else I could do to iron out my fucked up life, and save my beautiful, fairytale relationship?Summary:

The cutest and smartest girl in class finished the test first and then she asked the teacher if she could draw on the white board.(now that I recall a bit better it was a 4th/5th grade split class and she was in 5th grade)For some odd reason I got really pissed at her and got up and erased what she drew. I remember that it was Jack and the beanstalk and it looked. The teacher and some of the girls friends got mad at me. The girl herself didn't look like she really cared. I got written up. Years after that I saw her in highschool. I recognized her right away and I guess she remembered me too. She walked up to me and asked me if I was the asshole who erased her drawing back then.Summary:
Summarize: I ride also. I am very critical of people being stupid on bikes as it makes us all look bad -- much in the way people abusing firearms makes shooters (like myself) look bad. Be responsible in everything you do ladies/gents! THANK YOU! Any time I have a gripe about either of these topics people GO OFF on me... "Oh, what do you have against bikers/gun owners? What's your fuckin problem? yada yada yada" I have a problem with NEITHER of those things...it's when they are being used by a jack-ass to commit acts of douchebaggery that pisses me off....and I just wish I saw LESS of it. For every responsible gun owner I see, I see some dangerous yahoo who thinks they're toys, and acts like they're an extension of their penis. For every safe/responsible biker I see, I see "Mr. Stunt-rider" poppin wheelies next to me at highway speeds, or "gunning it" through the gap between cars when traffic slows.Summary:
Summarize: We've been together for three years and we have a seven month old son. Please don't comment on our ages/the fact that we have a child, as I feel that it's irrelevant (not to mention that I've heard everything you'd like to say at least 1000x since I've been pregnant). We got engaged two years ago (I hate the word fiancee so I just call him my boyfriend). Our relationship was great when we were younger, but now that we've put all of this responsibility onto ourselves he's starting to show his true colors. We both live with his parents full-time and although the household is civil, I see urgency to move out as I feel it's unfair to everyone involved for us to live in their home scott-free with our child. He sees it differently- he's said to me before "we can just wait till they ask us to leave". He's also a VERY lazy parent. I'd say I do 90% of the work with him doing 10%. His mother and I have had several conversations about his laziness and she insists that it's a part of who he is, that his father is the same way, and that if I really loved him that I would just let it go and accept him for who he is. Since turning 21, ALL he cares about is drinking and gambling. He's only been 21 for 3 months so I'm giving him time to come out of it, but it's super annoying. He's not an angry drunk, and he never drives while inebriated but he spends ALL of his money on alcohol and it gets on my nerves, considering I haven't spent money on myself since our son was born. He also has poor habits in work and at school. For instance, his parents paid for his college IN FULL and he's on the verge of being thrown out. He'd rather play video games than focus on getting his degree. He has a job for the weekends but he gets in trouble there for stupid shit (coming in late, dress code, etc). What do I do, guys? I've talked to him about all of the above too many times to count, I feel as though I'm at the end of my rope.Summary:

Summarize: Each book has it's own theme. Batman is your classic superhero book. Expect big, flashy stories. Detective Comics on the other hand is more grounded. The mystery side of the story is more played up and over all it's a bit more grim. The Dark Knight even more so. It's the more classic, Frank Miller take on Batman but unlike Tec doesn't skip out on the flash and weird. Finally Batman and Robin is the team book. The Dynamic duo at it's finest. On the creative end each has it's own teams as well. Snyder is working on Batman and has had an awesome run on Detective Comics. Meanwhile Tony Daniel's is moving to Tec doing both art and story. His last run was pretty average however his art is top notch. The Dark Knight is being written by Finch as well as doing the art. Again the art is awesome but the story if it's anything like his previous work will be pretty bland. B&R is being done by Tomasi and Gleason who are pretty good. Tomasi had a good run on Nightwing and did an arc on B&R before the reboot.Summary:
Summarize: The house is a basic rectangle, with the long side facing south. The living spaces are on the first floor on the east end, and the garage is on the west end. The second floor is all bedrooms and a library. This way, the garage and its attic act as a buffer in the afternoon during hot weather to block/absorb the heat from getting to the living spaces. That's a big problem here in the late summer when it can be 100 degrees. The house is a concrete slab on grade with radiant floor heat, and has a 95+% efficient modulating/condensing boiler that heats the water for the slab and for domestic use. This cuts down on energy use considerably versus your standard 80% boiler and hot water heater. It's like a really big wall mounted instant hot water heater. That's the only form of heating in the house. Even in winter I don't need to turn the heat on upstairs as it just radiates up through everything. Next, it's well insulated. I exceeded the IECC requirements for R-value in the walls and ceiling. Walls are cor-bond spray foam, 2x6, essentially filled. The ceiling is like r-60, blown in. I used high quality insulating Marvin windows, and the house is set up in 'cells' so that you get cross ventilation through the rooms. This is key in staying cool in summer. I open the windows up and the slab cools down, then close them up and the slab 'absorbs' the heat during the day and keeps the house cool. Same in the garage. The house has deep overhangs on the south that shade almost the entire front from the sun during most of the day in the summer. The west side of the house is covered in vines and sheltered by trees I planted to again mitigate the heat coming in from the afternoon summer sun. I bought all energy star appliances and went for the most efficient ones I could afford. Low flow shower heads, toilets, and CFL's throughout. So, it does require a little active effort with opening and closing windows. As long as it cools down during the night, the house will stay under 70 downstairs and peaks out at about 75 upstairs if the outside temp hits 95+ during the day. I know people whose newer homes that are 'spec homes' that face due west get up into the high 80's inside in the evening as the heat makes it through. I can't even imagine that. Anyway,Summary:
Summarize: Oh my lord. I met a guy online once when my boyfriend and I had broken up for a month or so. We messaged for a while first, then texted...this elevated into phone and Skype calls. He looked attractive, had a sexy irish accent, we got along swimmingly. We made plans for him to spend the weekend in my town three hours away (on his own) to enjoy a night out and the following day together. The instant we met there was a disconnect, but I went through with it. We left his truck at the meeting spot, and rode into the city. He kept trying to put his arm around me or hold my hand, which I would politely evade. Got dinner, during which he wanted to play 20 questions through the entire meal...red flag. Leave the restaurant, to take a romantic stroll through downtown...I am way uncomfortable and play the 'I'm not ready card' (which I really wasn't...) during which he consoles me and I try to talk more about what happened with my boyfriend and why I couldn't possibly start again yet. He then proceeds to show me his WEDDING RING, which he is STILL WEARING from a last minute canceled marriage like two years prior. We get to my car, I start the waterworks, he PETS ME, PICKS ME UP AND CARRIES ME AROUND DANCING IN THE STREET, AND KISSES ME. I am WAY ready to drop off this weirdo and go home, so eventually after about 20 minutes of telling him it isn't going to work, he gets weird. Goes emotional: "Well, you know if we are just friends our conversations have to change, right?" holding my hands in his hands I just, eyes downcast, "Yes." He, squeezing my hands, "Look me in the eyes and tell me that you really understand that." I bristle, snap my head up, and dead in his face: "YES." He gets passively-aggressive, clipped, short, dramatic. I'm freaking out inside. I try to get him into my car and he resists, finally opens my door for me and then proceeds to THROW himself into my passenger's seat, leaning forward and cradling his head in his hands for the majority of the ride back. I literally have my knife at my left thigh, afraid this psycho is going to jerk the wheel and kill us both. We make it back to his truck, and he won't get the fuck out of my car. I finally get him out, and go to hand him his sunglasses that he was sitting on. Him: "No, you keep them." Like a fucking MOMENTO. Tell him to drive safe, slam that bitch in reverse and GTFO of there. Dropped off after a few days later I asked how his day was when he texted me, and he goes "I'd tell you but I don't want you to worry." Nope. I'm good. Nope. Bye.Summary:
Summarize: For the last few months my wife has been acting distant and strange. She has been guarding her phone, working out furiously, and generally seemed unhappy. I chalked it up to a marriage rut. Until recently. A week ago my wife went to a marketing conference in Vegas. She went a couple days early to enjoy the city, I didn't think anything of it really. Also for this to make sense we use facebook messenger alot while she is away to say hi, check in and share pictures of our day. On a Sunday afternoon she happened to bump into a "guy" from X company who she "had met with a few times." I asked who, and she said that it was no one I would no of and this seemed weird to me, because... Generally, my wife talks about every single person she networks with non-stop. There name, who they look like, how many kids they have, etc. etc. etc. And usually she is overly transparent about who she is with, which has really helped me to trust her over the years of these sorts of trips. But this guy from X Co. was a person I literally only new his gender and company that he works for. Something was twisting in my gut, because I got a facebook message that X Co. Guy and her were going to go to a Cirque du Soleil - Zumanity. Basically a sensual sex version of the show. Look up the trailer and tell me what your reaction to this info would have been. Naturally messaged her that it seemed strange to go with him to this show and I was kind uncomfortable, but she was off on her way... with vague reassurances some "other" may meet them there. As she was settling into her seats at the theater I helplessly offered that she have fun, but please call me when she got back to the hotel. Anyways, I was sitting at home uncomfortable and decided to see if I could find out who this X Co. Guy was, I remembered seeing a guy comment on my wife's twitter last fall after a similar trip to vegas. I had no clue who he was at the time, and wasn't threatened, so I forgot all about him. Well, it turns out that he in fact does work for X Co, was calling my wife pet names in a tweet (such as doll), offered to buy her drinks on this current trip to Vegas . . . I guess I should have been paranoidally searching her tweets earlier....... The last twitter straw was this... Apparently sometime last winter my wife sent him a care package for his dog who has gone through surgery. He thanked her for it with a picture of the package, including what I could clearly see as my wife's handwriting telling the dog to get well. PRETTY MUCH FULL BLOWN PANIC. (But it is worth noting that I am not !00% sure that twitter guy is X Co guy, it is possible that they work at the same small marketing company, but how likely is that??) Given what I said before about how much my wife talks about her work and everyone. This care package is def something she would have told me about. At the moment I was spinning. I waited the rest of the time patiently for the show to end, then another 20 min to give her time to get back to the hotel. Then I sent her a FB message >Me: Make it back to the hotel yet babe? >Wife: "Ya I'm at the hotel" FOUR LONG MIN PASS >Me: That’s good. Make it back to your room yet >Wife: Ya but I'm going Back down apparently" >Me: Can we Skype for a min? >Wife: "Fast" >Wife: "Now" What followed was one of the shortest most awkward skype calls ever, she was in the bathroom/doorway, with the lights to the room nearly off, even though she had been in there for 10 min at least and my wife usually is a sleep with the lights on girl. She told me that there were "people in the bar" who wanted her to come hang out and then basically hung up on me. This didn't help my panic. In an effort to shorten this a bit. I eventually decided to pull all the GPS info from our FB Messenger chats through out the weekend. And my fears were strongly confirmed when the GPS locations of 20 message when I knew she was in her room came from one corner of a large Vegas hotel and the above messages from that night (seconds before the awkward hotel room skype call) all came from the opposite end. With heart stopping accuracy. So the one thing I know for sure is, that she Skyped me from someone else's hotel room claiming it was her own. Incidentally, the next message from her after "now" in my inbox was two hours later from the same GPS point telling me that she was "Goin to bed. Love you" at 1:30 in the morning. What should I do now. She hasn't mentioned the night at all since I have been afraid to bring it up so I would love some interpretations of the nights events, along with advice on where to go from here. How to start the conversation about it.Summary:
Summarize: As a lactose intolerant person, I want the bandwagon to roll into anti-lactoseville. Then I will get way more lactose free products. Not fucking soy, not bitch-ass almonds and not motherfucking coconut. I want cow's milk with the fucking lactose removed. There is currently a limited selection but I'm hoping that eventually the bandwagon will come my way and the market will explode giving me delicious dairy treats that don't make my digestive system turn against me.Summary:
Summarize: Dude, it's just high school. Like honestly I went through some shit my sophomore year (I didn't really have friends/was fat/did drugs) and what helped is I got a job. I made friends with people who had nothing to do with hs, this changed my life. I realised ppl treated me like shit at school because THEY HAD NOTHING ELSE IN THEIR LIVES... they literally revolved around school drama. Make friends with older/good influences, you'll realize that high school is like a separate world, and you can limit the amount of thought you give it.Summary:
Summarize: So lately I have been playing a lot of Udyr. And I mean a lot . As in only udyr for the last 3 days now. Mostly my interest was piqued because of his slight rework so I tried a few games out with him. And he was awesome. Udyr is a lot more underrated then he appears, and requires a lot of decision making to play well. But first, I'll give you the basic info on Udyr. No ult Udyr has no ult and this leads to some really unique gameplay and decision making opportunities. All of his skills are able to be leveled up 5 times, which means by 18 one skill will only have 3 points in it. This means he has a lot more decision making that is inherently required to play him well, but also allows him to be one of the more reactive champions out there, being able to level up which skill makes him into what his team needs most pre-rework I'll admit, udyr was pretty weak. He was fun, and on paper his skills looked like they were strong, but in game play they fell short. A move speed boost with a stun? thats great...unless they have an escape. A shield that gives sustain works great on lee sin right? Lee sin has better base stats and is able to apply that shield to a team mate. In short his kit looked like an A+ but felt like a B-. Reworked Udyr Now, I know Riot often tends to want to ballance champs towards the underpowered side, then on the overpowered side, but at first I felt like this rework was uncalled for and honestly, a little bit silly, and honestly, worse. Removing bonus armor/mr for 5 ms? bad. Turtle no longer restores mana? Even poorer sustain. Increase the ms boost from bear is good and all, but decrease the duration? ugh. No more bonus AP/AD from phoenix? You're killing me riot. But I was so wrong. Two skills that give me an AS and MS steroid, plus a stun and a mini leap, synergising with his passive, which is basically a weaker form of those two skills? More powerful then I expected. I'll admit that the last few days his Q and E felt much more powerful then before the rework. I think that actually, he is even more fun now then he was previously, and this was definitely a good rework for him. But he still isn't perfect. At this point if almost feels like because his Q and E have become so much more powerful, and considering the nerfs to W and R, there really isn't much point in taking R after 3 or 4 points in E, and W is pretty useless. He lost that ability to be reactive to the enemies. My solution Each skill has a persistent and an activation effect. The persistent behaving exactly as a passive would as long as that skill is active, and each skill granting an additional effect for the first few seconds it is active. Give each skill a passive, that scales with its level and is active even when the skill is not. For example each level of tiger would give an additional 1% AS per level. Turtle would give an additional 2 armor/mr per level. Bear would give an addition 1-2 MS per level, and Phoenix would give maybe 2% crit chance per level. These are just examples, and they wouldn't need to stack with the persistent effects of having the skills active. I think this would open up a lot more diverse ways to play udyr, since leveling up one skill benefits you even when you don't have it active. Disclaimer I know that its hard to compare udyr's skills with those of other champions because his skills are much more diverse and unique then any other champions, which I love about him. However because of this it is hard to make accurate comparisons to other champs/skills because of this.Summary:
Summarize: None is always the safe bet. No guy has ever complained about a shaved vagina. Some guys "don't mind" pubic hair, but a lot do. Depends on the girl, and on the guy's preferences. Personally, I like skinny girls with nice butts. The size of a girl's boobs don't matter as much as women think it does. We just like boobs. Don't try to be "one of the guys." Guys hate that. It's really cool if you like sports, but don't burp and fart and make dick jokes. We have our friends for that. We just want to put our wieners in them... we don't care much what they look like. It's not like we go back to our friends like "That girl had the sexiest vagina ever!" (Unless it was really amazingly perfect.) SoSummary:
Summarize: The thing about Tomb Raider was that we were to find out Lara's origins - just as you say the game describes them. But we know she turns out badass, because we've seen her being basically the first big badass action girl in video games. So, if we're to learn her origins, and it looks like they include being raped, then this is a very big problem. Because there is a distressing tendency to inflict sexual violence on female characters to "toughen them up," to make women strong and resourceful in response to having been raped and sexually exploited. And it's really disgusting, because a woman does not need "toughening up." A woman can be tough without any horrifying experiences making her so. Yet in most works of fiction, women are made to "pay" for their badassitude with horrifying things that are related to their sexuality, most often rape. Indeed, most of the time it almost looks like they are preemptively punished for it: overstepping the meek boundaries, "entering the man's world" means a woman must suffer. Would you want James Bond to have a backstory of a pedophile adoptive father who raped him, which meant young James got very cunning and good at escaping an unwanted dick up his arse? No, because you would have felt the dignity of the character was taken away. And you would be right.Summary:

Summarize: In my entire life I have had only ONE pair of jeans that I can call truly comfortable to wear. They are a slim fit Tommy Hilfiger jeans and sad to say they are now fading and the knees look like they might split soon. I have to find a new pair. I have three pairs of jeans, Tommy Hilfiger, Jack & Jones Anti-Fit, and a pair of Levi's. My main problem is a few things put together. I cannot stand a skinny cut but I like the pants to be slimmer/tighter below the knees. I have big thighs and a big ass for a man unfortunately so what ends up happening is either tightness in the upper thighs, tightness in the crotch, or the pants hanging off my ass. I dress business casual and I commonly wear dress shirts or sport shirts that aren't tucked in. I can't have the pants sagging off my ass, it just doesn't make for a good look. I can never find a compromise between these three issues: High rise(sit at waist or at least above the hips somewhat), comfortable space in the groin/crotch area, Not tight around upper thighs. Now, I've always been a bargain shopper and shopped at TJ Maxx outlets and other similar outlets getting my brand name clothing for under $30 but I'm fed up and I'm ready to start buying some shit that actually fits comfortably. Is raw denim my only option? Is it even an option? Also, a major thing I should mention as well is I need the material to not be too thick, I sweat a lot and I cannot stand when my legs get hot underneath my jeans (or any pants for that matter). For the record, I seem to have a similar issue with dress pants and khakis where the pants don't sit high at my waist. Thanks for reading and I hope to get some insight into this. I'm not a fashionable guy, I got the hot girl early on in life and I never really had to worry about my looks. Now I finally make enough money to justify spending on my clothing and I'm actually at the point where I am truly fed up with my constant discomfort with my wardrobe. Thank you!Summary:
Summarize: Suppose a bit of back story would help. I was recently promoted to a position of supervision within my current company, coming off the floor I know the woes of the people I am now in charge of watching over. It is a warehouse environment, pulling auto motive parts that range from little fuses and bulbs to heavier items such as full pallets of oil, brake drums, crank shafts, etc. so it is understandable that the turn-over rate would be high as the wear and tear gets to people over time. New employees don't accrue vacation / personal time until being with the company for a full year, benefits after probation period of 90 days or so, however we try to do our best to help folks out with day off requests if the workload is not to bad for that particular day. We tell new hires up front what to expect so there are no surprises (busy season resulting in longer hours / overtime many days) and 90% of the time they agree and say no problem, onward with the hiring process. Now for the ranting. Though many of our new hires have already begun to take advantage of the call off policies, will give an example of one of the more recent hires. Hired a guy a few months back now as a temp / part-time worker, hard working kid with a good attitude, coming to work daily, and not having to micro manage everything he does. Spot becomes available for a permanent position, offer it to him, gladly accepts. No problem. Fast forward a month down the road, begins to have some family issues happening at home, we allow a day here and there for him to take care of business so he can come back focused. Starts to take advantage of the attendance policy, calling in sick on Monday's / Friday's, usually some excuse along the lines of 'I have a headache' or 'I slept on my neck funny'. Anyhow finally reaches the point of having to sit him down and let him know this is not acceptable behavior, and if he continues down this road it could lead to more corrective action all the way to termination. Immediately gets aggressive saying we are asking to much of them, and that the place is a sweatshop, etc. etc. which we discuss for about 10 more minutes before finally letting him decide whether we will be able to rely on him to continue coming to work daily or if he should pursue other interests. He of course says he would like to remain with us. Get home for the day after running errands and check my email, log into Facebook, and lo and behold, the said kid we just sat down with for a discussion is having an all out rant on Facebook about how we are the equivalent to a plantation and the workers our slaves, and how we are unreasonable since we will not move our start / end times around his schedule so he can go back to school. Maybe it's just me and he has valid points, on the other hand I can't help but think he was in a temp / part-time position that would have probably fit his schedule a bit easier, and was under no obligation to come to full time. Personally I can count on one hand the amount of sick time I have had to use in my last 6 years here.Summary:
Summarize: Ahh the age old group bathroom excursion question. I will try to explain to the best of my womanly abilities this strange female habit. I do believe there are two reasons why women travel to the bathroom in groups: firstly, and most prevalently, it happens because it has always happened. Pretty disappointing right? I know it's totally dumb but it's just one of those social pressures that women have to learn and then adhere to in order to get along with other women. For men a similarity might be the internal bathroom etiquette of not talking and spacing in urinals. At some point you had to learn this behavior, because it is expected of you to adhere to it. I could go into my theories for why I think the lady habit began in the first place but this comment is already long enough. Now the second reason, is why I personally adhere to this pack bathroom nonsense. Reason #2: there is safety in numbers. Rape, molestation, harassment are always an issue for women. Everyday you have to be aware that your safety from the opposite sex is not guaranteed and therefore must protect yourself. And the best deterrent from getting caught alone in one of those scary rape trap bathrooms out there is having 3 other friends that are down to kill a muthafucka for you. This is also why I have always only kept athletic female friends, but that's just a personal preference.Summary:
Summarize: First of all, I must say this story isn't exactly about a stranger or anything, but I feel like it fits relatively well in here. So this happened last school year, around September or October of 2012. My parents have been divorced for maybe 6 or 7 years now. When the divorce first happened, I visited both parents fairly equally, however, over time I began visiting my mom less and less (didn't like her apartment/eventual house, and absolutely hated the douchebag she married). By the time this happened, I was only visiting her on holidays. So at the time, I was just getting over a pretty bad case of pneumonia. Now I had noticed before how kinda crazy my mom was (once threatened to throw my sister's phone onto the road because she was texting her fiance during some holiday dinner. Keep in mind my sister was like 22 at the time.) While I was in the hospital, I overheard my mom complaining to some nurses or whatever about the fact that my step mom was the one who took me to the hospital. Like what the hell. I don't see what the problem with that is since she cared enough to take off work and get me to the hospital and everything. As I was saying, getting over pneumonia, so on this Friday night my sisters were going over to my mom's for the weekend, as they do every other weekend. As they are walking out the door, my mom texts me saying that I need to come spend the weekend with her. So I kindly decline since I don't like being over there and don't even have a room at her house. So what does she do? She texts me saying something along the lines of it's not up to me, basically trying to force me (15 at the time) into going with her. So she takes my sisters to her house, then she texts me again saying that she's coming back for me. Now at this point I've locked myself in the room, thinking what the hell is happening right now. Now apparently, I later found out from my dad that she had texted him saying that I was going with her that night. My dad, knowing I never spend the night there, assumed she was just taking me to a baseball game or something and ran out to pick up my prescription, to help me deal with the cough from pneumonia. So now my dad and step mom are basically wondering what the hell is going on as well. So I continue to keep myself locked in my room and tell them that she's trying to force me to go with her. Now at this point, I'm not sure exactly what happened, but I expect my dad basically went outside with one of his guns and scared them off, cause that is definitely something he would do. After maybe 15 minutes my dad came back into my room and basically told me that my mom and step dad were gone and literally said no one would be able to make me go if I didn't want to cause he's a badass. After what happened, I just hated my mom so much. To this day, I have not spoken a word to her or replied to any of her texts. Luckily, she very rarely texts me anymore (the last time was to congratulate me on getting my license) and I just ignore it. She permanently ruined my relationship with her and I don't think it will ever be fixed.Summary:
Summarize: I don't wear a helmet on my commute to class, but I still think this article is bullshit. The whole thing is founded on the idea that when you wear a helmet you ride more recklessly. This notion seems not only ridiculous, but completely unfounded. I would imagine that, even if there was a very small increase in the number of accidents when everyone wore a helmet compared to no one wearing one, the large increase in severity of the accidents would show how stupid this article is.Summary:
Summarize: Honestly this last patch has been the most poorly thought out set of balance changes i've seen in a very long time. after all of the talk of melee being notoriously weaker then ranged in this game (except in the cases of tanks) riot starts nerfing melee assassins who are already performing at an average level in solo queue, and FAR below average in competitive..? what? not only are melee assassins weak in competitive play and are regularly bypassed for ranged mages in the VAST majority of games, but they are also average in solo queue. lets take a look at champions "tweaked" this patch.. Fizz: a champion who's pretty much rarely/never played professionally that literally has ONLY one function (deals damage, no hard cc, no utility, not tanky) and has an average 51% ish win rate in solo queue, gets nerfed into being completely UNPLAYABLE. this is not an exaggeration. fizz is not playable right now. Akali: a champion who is NEVER played competitively and that literally has ONLY one function (deals damage, no hard cc, no utility, not tanky) gets her range nerfed and her bread and butter burst combo outright REMOVED from the game. Zed: arguably the STRONGEST and MOST POPULAR of all the melee assassins in the game (definitely the best competitively) and who was probably deserving of an actual nerf, ends up with the most meaningless nerf out of the 3... a minor attack speed nerf, resulting in slightly less turret killing power and slightly less dps in extended fights Ahri: a RANGED champion who is REGULARLY and CONSISTANTLY played in competitive, who has a solid above average solo queue winrate, and the most options in terms of playing in any style she chooses (passive/safe wave clearing, roaming, dueling, aggressive, poking, etc) gets MULTIPLE buffs. presumably under the guise of "compensation for the removal of DFG", an item which PLENTY of champions can effectively use, and yet only ahri gets a "compensation" buff for it, as if the champion wasn't functional without it. we've all seen people use DFG and make it work on tons of champs. ahri, leblanc, syndra, fizz, katarina, lissandra, etc. now, i want to make a very clear point on this entire concept of "counterplay" that riot has been obsessed with recently. this game is about DECISION MAKING and TEAM PLAY. if you get caught alone by a zed, a fizz, an akali, or another melee assassin, you SHOULD die. there shouldnt BE counterplay unless they make a mistake or your teammates save you. why? because if a melee assassin cant outduel people in 1v1s or do more damage then a ranged champion then there is literally NO advantage/reason to play a melee champion in this game unless you're a tank. ever. as an example to point out how ridiculous the recent "balance" changes are, how does it make sense for an ahri to be able to outduel a fizz and deal similar damage in a 1v1? she has similar damage, access to hard CC, better mana costs, better AND safer wave clear, better teamfighting, a ranged auto attack for csing and harassing, better sustain, ability to siege and NEVER has to risk melee range commitment. almost every ranged mage has these advantages Another point i want to bring up is that when people complain about assassins they have a bad habit of only thinking of games where the assassin gets fed and is running over their team. what if your teammates hadnt fed him? what if he was 0/0/0? would he still be one shotting you or 2v1ing you if you were ready for it? probably not. sure, if he catches you off guard 1v1 you'd still die or have to run, but thats the whole purpose of assassins.. 9/10 times the reason an assassin is snowballing is because you have a bad teammate who misplayed and fed him. thats how this game works. it has nothing to do with the champions involved. your teammate fed someone, so that person is stronger then he should be and he takes over the game, it happens all the time, not just with assassins. you just "feel" it more when you get caught by a fed assassin because you die quickly anyway, im getting pretty tired of all of these balance changes that have been happening under the guise of "counterplay", because the majority of them dont seem to have anything to do with counterplay. it just seems to be trying to appease bad solo queue players who never group in this TEAM game and constantly get caught out alone, then blame the champions involved instead of their bad decision to be alone at the 25 min mark. also, random side note, build paths for melee damage dealers SUCK. they are almost always less efficient then the typical morello/raba/void combo that ranged mages use, or the paths ADCs use. its annoying how streamlined tank/adc/mage build paths are, while melee carry build paths are sloppy and scatteredSummary:
Summarize: This will probably get buried at this point but whatever. here you go but I think I was most influenced in my teen years by bands like Venom, Bathory and Burzum. I didnt get along with anyone else in school and was just like "fuck it" and I think I started dressing that way to annoy everyone as much as possible because they were all a bag of small town dicks. THEN as you get a bit older and you see all of the 40 year old women trying to desperately cling to their gothic youth with their piercings that are now sagging and their stupid pyramid stud belts you wake up and think "I dont want to be that creepy old bitch hanging out with teenage goth kids" and you get your shit together. I took the metal out of my face and the ring in my septum big enough to fit a golf tee through, bleached my hair to white and enrolled in university. You just GROW OUT of it. If you dont grow out of it theres something wrong with you. unless youre a big black metal fan in which case fuck it, you can pull that shit off forever. Still love black metal, but now I enrich my life and step out there with glorious tunes by bands like passenger of shit and in a few more years Ill be rocking a PHD.Summary:
Summarize: I'm a 5th year HoH student and I don't sign at all. I can hear/speak pretty well and I don't hang out with other deaf people because of the stereotypes. I work at crossroads and people constantly come up to me and sign or just give me some wavy arm motion to try to indicate what they want because they assume that I sign, or they assume that I won't hear them if they try to speak, which really annoys me. Deaf people complain that hearing people think they are retarded. Some do and there is a good reason for it. All people learn to speak by mimicking what they hear, so you have deaf and hoh kids who don't hear anything, or they just hear stuff differently, so when they talk they have a deaf accent, or they just make loud hooting grunting sounds, to a hearing person, it sounds similar to the sounds retarded people make. True, it is the fault of hearing people for believing this sterotype, but it would be really nice if deaf and hoh kids would stop perpetuating this stereotype too. Personally, I stereotype hearing people based on the way I've seen deaf people treated. I may ask you to repeat yourself once or twice (or maybe more than that) but you don't need to shot at me.Summary:
Summarize: I do not really get along with my sister, because she is the original scumbag Stacy. We couldn't live more opposite lives. But most recently her housing (Section 8) was in jeopardy of being taken away. Due to the fact that her boyfriend was living with her and the 3 kids. He is an ex-convict, does not have a job. Has a drug problem, no money, no car and what food stamps the government gives him goes to his parents. (Because they need them..yea right) Not the place where you eat 3 meals a day and the state only gives her enough for her and the 3 kids. Anyways. Housing, so she was going to get kicked off of housing if she didn't come up with 275$. She told the family that we needed to pay for it or she could be homeless. She has a job, gets child support, ssi for the kids. She had more than a month to come up with the money. Says she can't come up with it. So my Nmom decides to offer her 2 of the spare rooms in her house, pretty much giving them half of the house to themselves with the exception of no boyfriend and no dogs. Also my sister was to not have any company over. She would of been charged $500 a month and out of that $300 of would be put away for her in a savings account to help her get a place. Buttttttttt Noooo! "I can't live without my boyfriend, we want to be a family. I will have to make my kids live in the car and become homeless if you don't let my boyfriend stay with me." So she would rather become homeless and live in her car, instead of putting a roof over her kids head. Are you fucking dumb. Did you have a bowl of dumb for breakfast? I wish I could say that it stops there, but sadly it does not. 2 of her kids birthdays were this week, so I sent her a text last week saying I would like to wish the kids a Happy Birthday. No response, talked to her daughter at her fathers house. And guess what? She never had told the kids I wished them a happy Birthday.Summary:
Summarize: I'll be graduating this May and I have had several negative experiences when applying to jobs, interviewing, and communicating with HR. I interviewed for a job in early February and was offered the job two weeks later. Three weeks after receiving a verbal offer, I have yet to receive my offer letter or any indication of when I can expect to start, my salary, etc. I had this same experience with a different company this time last year when interviewing for an internship. In that instance, the company forgot to tell me that I even got the job. I feel like I'm being taken advantage of. When I talked to my interviewer over the phone, I acutely felt like I was being patronized. He said that he doesn't know when the offer letter will be sent to me nor when I can expect to start. It all seems extremely unprofessional.... This company is considered a fortune 500. I strongly expect that they will low ball me on salary and I don't feel like I have room to negotiate. I feel like they don't really care about me.Summary:
Summarize: Dear gunnit: I just bought an sks for $80 and a log of grizzly long cut from a friend, and the only thing wrong with it is some light rusting. I plan on redoing the bluing(love when I rhyme on accident) on it, its got a thin film of rust on pretty much the entire barrel and a few other parts. I'm doing the hot bluing because I just feel like the cold bluing method isn't as good. Any tips, advice, and things to watch out for would be immensely appreciated. Will post before, during, and after pics and hopefully a video of the do it yourself hot bluing process after I've done it all. If anybody has experience with this, I'd appreciate input on the tricky parts that they don't really tell you about in the step by step process.Summary:

Summarize: Can we do away with the word "privilege"? Imagine two (completely hypothetical) scenarios: &nbsp; (1) A person is driving four kilometers over the speed limit on an empty road. Behind him is a police cruiser, which flashes its lights and follows this person's vehicle until they pull over. The officer approaches the driver and asks them for their license and registration. The driver complies. The officer checks that the registration is still in date and hands the paper back to the driver. He tells the driver that they were going 4 over the speed limit and warns them to watch their speed in the future. The individual thanks the officer and has a wonderful day. (2) A person is driving four kilometers an hour over the speed limit on an empty road. Behind him is a police cruiser, which flashes its lights and sirens and follows this person's vehicle until they pull over. The officer approaches the vehicle with his hand on his service weapon, reaches the driver's side door, shines his flashlight in the driver's face, and demands their license and registration. The driver complies. The officer carefully checks their license and registration, returns to his vehicle, and checks for records and outstanding warrants on the driver. He finds none. He returns to the vehicle and asks the driver how much they exceeded the speed limit. The driver isn't certain but estimates 4 or 5. The officer tells them 15. The driver apologizes and assures the officer that they will not exceed the speed limit again. The officer writes them a ticket and asks how much the windows are tinted. The driver says they aren't certain because the vehicle was purchased last month from a used car dealer. The officer suggests that the window tint breaks regulations and temporarily detains the driver and his vehicle while he calls in a K-9 unit. The driver waits 45 minutes for the K-9 unit, which searches the vehicle very carefully. The dog barks. The police open the vehicle and search under the seat, in the trunk, and in the glove compartment. They find $300 cash, but no drugs. Just to be certain, one of the officers rips open the upholstery on the seats. Still, they find no drugs. The officers seize the cash under asset forfeiture and leave. &nbsp; The first situation is not privilege. It's how everyone should be treated. I, as a dude, have been catcalled. It's not fun. But the fact that I can walk around, even in a poor neighbourhood, and have absolutely no expectation that nobody will harass me is not privilege. The fact that the police call me "sir" is not privilege. The fact that I have a right to vote (more or less) is not privilege. Progress is, by definition, progressive, not regressive. Why should we assume that being free from discrimination, hate, and objectification is somehow abnormal? The fact that it's abnormal for some people is horrific, and it should be a priority to change it. That's not to say that privilege does not exist. Someone born wealthy has "privilege". However, someone born black is not trampled by the privilege of the majority, their discriminated against. Can we stop pretending that being miserable, oppressed, hated, victimized, and marginalized is the norm? When the author of this article writes, "It reinforces their sense of privilege, which they then have to work that much harder to dismantle in themselves. It’s that much more difficult to recognize women as human. Humanization—the recognition of the 'other' as equally valuable as oneself—is foundational to giving and receiving love and compassion. Privilege impairs men’s ability to do so." she's creating this backwards fantasy in which reading white, straight, cisgendered, male, often upper or middle class men have been given some sort of gift that they don't deserve, which in turn implies that these gifts, including there being lots of straight, white, males running around the Western Cannon, is somehow a bad thing. It's not. The problem is not that there are too many straight, white, male protagonists and that their books should be burned. The problem is that there aren't enough women, gays, transsexuals, black people, Asians, Latinos, aboriginals, Semitics, Indians, transgendered people, transvestites, etcetera etcetera for time immemorial. Do you know what? That takes time to fix. Nor should the steady flow of cracker characters stop. When a writer writes a book, their main character should be as they imagined them. Injecting a black woman into a white man's story has two outcomes: blackface or whitewashing, both of which exacerbate the race/gender problem and make for a crappy book. &nbsp; Finally, I couldn't help but shake the feeling that the author felt like Tolkien owed her her lifetime guarantee 50%-off strong female character, TM Disney, that delectable trope of only one dimension. Why? Let the man write what he wants. Its his book. Is the Odyssey bad now because Homer didn't think to make Odysseus a Japanese lesbian? Is Hamlet now sub-par because there weren't enough transautistic, genderfluid, pan-African otherkin in Denmark? I don't mean to go full-out /r/tumblrinaction, but the implication is there, and it's slightly ridiculous.Summary:
Summarize: I know this from personal experience, it is difficult but not impossible. My ex-so had pulled the same thing on me. I did not take it quite as well as you did and I got quite mad at her. It was not until these past weeks that my kid sister, who had loved my ex got back in contact with her that we started talking again. It was awkward and it still is but we are now getting used to the idea of seeing each other as mostly friends and it gets easier by the minute. However, the first months were a bitch and things went down hill fast. There was arguing and cursing out and we both said things we regret. I still cannot trust her but I am getting more used to the idea. It was her initial desire to be just friends and I am the one who caused the difficulties. I think op has a much better situation than I did and he will probably be better off than me seeing how it has already working towards the goal of becoming friends. Good luck mateSummary:
Summarize: Learn to build a WPF control with an overridden onrender. WPF is powerful and fantastically extensible. Under it's outer layer of convenience features is a well thought out and powerful engine. You'll save a lot of time just writing it yourself. WPF is a great tool for this job, if you learn to extend it a bit. When in doubt, go deeper. Based on your mockup, I'd use 9 panel .png tiles (only three of which visible in any specific view), and spend a little time learning about cutting up bitmaps programmatically in WPF and applying transforms. Overriding OnRender gives you direct access to draw commands.Summary:
Summarize: I live in an apartment building where internet is included in the rent and provided by one ISP to the whole building. From what I understand, they control a router for the whole building. My setup, which worked from last June to November, was: Wall -> Netgear GS105E ethernet switch -> Netgear WGR614 wireless router -> wirelessly connected to PS3 slim and computer. (the ethernet switch also goes to a Directv box) In November I got Black Ops 2, and after 2 weeks of playing, I lost the ability to connect to multiplayer games, and then eventually the ability to connect to the Zombie mode with my friends. After a few months of trying to troubleshoot, I got multiplayer to work by using a wired connection from the router to the PS3 and having my ISP open the necessary ports for the games I play. This took a long time to get to and playing around with tons of settings. I recently purchased new games (Socom 4, Socom Confrontation) that according to Sony have the same port requirements as my old games but I cannot connect online. I've made sure my ISP has these ports open, and they say they can't assign my PS3 a static ip address or put it in the DMZ. Basically both Sony and my ISP say there's nothing else they can do and it's the others fault. I assume it's a firewall problem with my ISPs router, since if I take my PS3 to a friends place multiplayer works just fine, and I still can't connect if I bypass my router at home. Does anyone know of something else that may be preventing online play? I'm upset because I resigned my lease a few weeks before buying the new games when I though my internet problems had been fixed.Summary:
Summarize: Class setup: (I have 11 different knife classes setup with every perk combination possible, but this was by far my most successful and fun) Specialist: Heat Wave (can't believe I am saying this but I may try Rejack to save the bloodthirstys, plus can finish his Hero gear maybe) Primary: None Secondary: Knife (duh) Explosives: None Tactical: Smoke Screen Perk 1: Sixth Sense & Flak Jacket/Ghost Perk 2: Scavenger & Tracker Perk 3: Tac Mask Playlist: Chaos Moshpit Hardpoint Ground War The knife is all I have left for Dark Matter. Last night in about in an hour got over 100 kills while having a blast. I tried all three of these gamemodes, and I got most kills on Choas while Nuketown Dom was picked almost every game. I was averaging easily 20 kills. Few games I had about 37 kills and 20 some deaths. I only went negative 1 game and that was on a safeguard game (not best option for knife kills). My Tactics: Spawn Run passed the house and throw both smokes in B dom area and middle Run through the smoke cover watching radar for dots and sixth sense and picking up extra smokes See a dot or sixth sense alarm turn and strike Throw more smokes in middle and if you are already in middle then right outside their house Go into their house hardscoping radar and wait (yes I know you have to be "that guy" but if they are going for DM or have gotten DM they will understand) get kills or get killed rinse and repeat It was so much fun just spamming smoke. If I wasn't getting killed much the entire middle was covered the entire time. No one had a clue what to do it was fantastic chaos. And my KD didn't suffer half as much as it did for the pistol's camo challenges. Hell it actually helped it in a few games lol. I am hoping tonight will be the night. Only 3 more bloodthirstys and I am done. The knife is a blast but when you are on 4 kills and panicking and radar shows a fifth victim and you swipe and it doesn't register its a huge nut punch. Like I said before I use heat wave and it is really good, but Rejack may actually be useful for once to keep the bloodthirstys alive since I have died many many times while having 4 kills. Just wanted to share my setup and experience finishing the knife because it was been probably the most fun to finish, especially after finishing the LCAR and RK5 fuck those things. The best part was littering the map with smoke and watching people not have a clue because no one uses smoke, let alone 3-4 cans of it a spawn LOL.Summary:
Summarize: It sounds like you need to make some friends. It's not too difficult, either. There are a lot of venues for social interaction (clubs, discussion groups, gaming), and I know you'd be surprised by how many/much people can relate to you, at least somewhat. My brother's been having some similar issues, but luckily he won't kill himself because he knows I'd be sad. Just get outside, breath fresh air, try to eat fresh foods, and meet some fresh people. If you're unhappy, break the cycle by making a change or two.Summary:
Summarize: a few months ago, i got a letter in the mail from an insurance company saying that i was in an auto accident in a nearby city, which was false. the letter was addressed to a made up first name with the same first initial, and my last name (and obviously to my exact address). i emailed the agent at the insurance company, and cc'd the insurance fraud division in my state. the fraud division never replied to this or any further emails. i eventually heard back from the insurance agent, and she asked for me to scan and email back the letters that SHE had sent me (!). then the DMV sends me a letter saying that my license was about to be suspended because i was not responding to this accident report. well, not me exactly, but the fake me. i replied to the agent with the info, and shortly after, she replied with this: > Hello, Thank you for sending copies of the letters sent to you. We have checked our file and these letters were intended for a XYZ who was a driver involved in an accident with our insured. He provided this address (the ones on the letter) to our policy holder at the time of the accident. You may disregard these letters and we will update our claim file to reflect the address we have is incorrect. Should you have any other questions, please contact us at the number below. i then replied to the dmv and sent them the whole stack of correspondence, saying they had the wrong person, and i was suspecting possible identity / insurance fraud. the dmv sent back a letter in typical bureaucratic fashion, saying they would check their records to make sure they had the right info, and they would contact the other party, and mentioned nothing about the fraud or identity theft. shortly after, they sent another letter saying the party didn't respond, so this thing was off "my" record... for now. here comes the good part: i get a letter from the dmv saying "my" vehicle was not registered, and it included the offending car's license plate, and the DRIVER'S LICENSE NUMBER. i was able to look up the plate, after discovering the smog check lookup in this [thread]( so, what's is going on here??Summary:
Summarize: When I was in grade 10 I drew a big collage of dicks on this girls binder in my foods class. My vice principle came into my programming class holding my magnificent art over her head. After the whole class burst into laughter she ran over grabbed my arm and literally ripped me out of my chair. We half sprinted to her office where she started telling me that I was going to fucking prison for sexual assault/ harassment. Don't worry I'm not stupid, I just started laughing. Apparently the girl who's binder I royally dicked up was her daughter. It gets even better, her mom introduced me to her to apologize for what I did. Three weeks later we had sex.Summary:
Summarize: This is a monster of his own making. He lied about the status of abortion in the bill and then lost control of his own story. From the beginning, the bill never funded abortions. The pro-choice community compromised out of the gate and decided not to fight for federal funding. The pro-lifers did not agree to a neutral stance and saw this as an opportunity to further restrict access to abortion. So Stupak tried to convince people that the bill was pro-abortion, even though it wasn't, so that he could shift the balance to his side. Ultimately he didn't get the votes (although Ben Nelson did, ultimately making the status quo more pro-life than it was before the bill was signed). Stupak didn't want to sink the bill, but had told everyone lies about it, so he looked hypocritical. The idea that voting for an anti-abortion bill makes him a baby killer is ridiculous. But that's what you get, Bart. The GOP wanted to stop this bill by any means necessary so they took your talking points and ran with them. Nobody with any brains believes this bill actually funds abortions, but it gets the winguts all angry so it works. Inorder to muster support, the GOP took the lie and rebroadcast it, making it look like you voted to fund abortions. Had you not been so greedy at the beginning and tried to institute a one-drop rule for federal funding, none of this would have happened. You overreached and lied and made the HCR bill much worse than it otherwise would have been. Had you accepted the neutral compromise, there'd have been a much higher chance of getting a public option with less to negotiate. Good riddance.Summary:
Summarize: I think i get nervous and i get those feelings. But sometimes its not because i feel nervous..... Yea think how i feel.. The only way i can describe it is: Feeling disconnected from my body. Immediat retreat is what i naturally NEED to do (as in leave the current situation. Shaking my hands, forcing a cry/vomiting are what i want to do. I have been having this happen to me since i was 17, i am turning 23 in july. I am a male and have never seen anybody with anxiety as bad as i have it. For the first 6 months i couldn't leave my house. Tried busparone, hated it. Backstory: I smoked alot of pot, and when i mean alot i mean that all i did. One day i smoked some weed and BAM SHIT>FAN. never been right since then. But when i think about it, i had these "feelings" even when i was very young but never thought anything of it. I am an overthinker, i stress over shit way the fuck too much. I understand that but thanks for telling! What can i do? i want an answer. I am in the middle of looking for a better job (i have a college degree), but am so fucking nervous that i will BE nervous that its controlling my life. If my heart rate gets up at all i freak out. I stop skateboarding, smoking, exercising because i couldn't handle it. to top it off i have a fast metabolism that i eventually turned into if im hungry, i panick! I have seen counselors nothing helped... seems like nothing is ever going to help me. I honestly just want to share with you all while i read your stories, i like them. They make me feel like im almost normal.Summary:
Summarize: I've got a similar story. I was in a male pageant in my high school. It wasn't a beauty pageant, per say, but more of a "who is more popular" pageant. Anyway, being the nerdy guy I am, I had to do something that would really put me ahead of the pack. So, when it came time for one of those random questions, mine was about which character (woodsman, lion, or scarecrow) I'd rather be and why. There was already a girl in the audience I wanted to ask out, so I figured I'd ask her out then. It worked in the movies. I remember saying something to the order of "I'd be the lion because I'd like to have the courage to ask out [what's her face]." The crowd loved it. She, on the other hand, did not. She ended up saying no and it made the rest of our time together (we shared a class) completely awkward. I graduated a year before her, so she had to sit through another year in high school as the girl that said no to the guy who asked her out in front of 500 people.Summary:
Summarize: It seems like a lot to pay for a glorified mylar bag. They talk about 45dB reduction, and Volts/Meter and whatnot, but they don't mention the most important thing...at what frequency? There's nothing magical about Faraday cages. The higher the sheet-conductivity, the better the shielding. A couple layers of carefully-folded aluminum foil would give you better protection. This type of conductive-film Faraday shielding only works against high-frequency EM waves. An EM pulse would have low frequency components (<100kHz) that would still penetrate the bag, because the bag simply doesn't have enough capacitance and is not well-grounded. If you truly want to beat an EMP pulse, you need to shield it with mu-metal (look it up). I've used this in physics labs to quash ambient EM low enough to detect individual flux quanta.Summary:
Summarize: A and I have spent most of our lives being best friends. We met in 7th grade and as fate would have it, happened to live in the same neighborhood. All we had to do was cut through two yards to be at the other's doorstep, so we had a habit of popping up at the other's house at all hours of the day and night--especially during summer. One night we were chatting on AIM (younger readers can Google what that is) and around midnight decide we cannot sleep so we'll go for a walk because we're bored 15 year olds and not afraid of the dark. We walk through the empty streets of our neighborhood, talking about boys and school and Harry Potter. I don't know how long we walk, but it was awhile because we eventually canvass the whole neighborhood and came to where the subdivision spills out into a more commercial part of town. There is no one around. I really cannot stress that enough. No late night dog walkers. No cars at the stop lights. Not a whole lot of human presence in terms of background noise either. You can faintly pick up the sound of some traffic from the highway, but other than that there is nothing and no one. Just two teenage girls out on a late summer's night stroll. Which suits us just fine so we keep walking. We round a corner onto one of the larger roads, which is banked by a lower-income neighborhood on the left and a long hill on the right, partially hiding a shopping center. All the shops in the strip are closed but we know the Kroger at the far end of the shopping center is 24 hours so we decide we'll head over there for a pop and some munchies then head home. Looking out over the hill, we see a desert of a parking lot. There are some cars parked sparsely toward the far end (by the grocery store), but it's mostly empty and poorly lit. Rather than take the darker and more direct route through the parking lot, we decide to go back down the hill and continue trekking along the road until we got to the street entrance. And it's a good thing we did too. Back to the road, we see our first fellow nightwalkers at the next stoplight -- a woman carrying some grocery bags and a guy in a white sedan who is not letting her cross the street. A and I are over a hundred yards away, can't really see the guy, but we do see him block her when she tries to cross at the crosswalk and then block her again when she retreats to cross the other way. We see the car and the woman do their dance again....and then A charges towards them like a mama rhino. It takes me two beats to realize what it happening, but I follow after her. A gets between the woman and the sedan and yells directly into the driver's open window, "WHAT THE FUCK IS THE PROBLEM?" The driver blinks, completely dumbstruck. I have caught up and am standing next to the woman, who is obviously frightened. "WHAT THE FUCK IS THE PROBLEM?" A asks again. The driver is the only one in the car, and starts yammering something about trying to talk the woman. Not wanting to get in the middle of a domestic, I ask the woman, "Do you know him?" "I have never seen him before in my life." She said shakily. "She says she doesn't you know, so again, what the FUCK is the problem?" A asks, staring this dude straight in the eye. Now, A and I may have been 15... but A is tall, an athlete, and has a most impressive "Don't-fuck-with-me-I'm-a-goddamn-badass" face. Oh, and by this point I have pulled out my mom's old first generation Nokia...no way he missed that monster. "Bitches." He muttered before speeding off into the night. The three of us stood there for a few moments, to make sure he was gone, and then hightailed it to another location in case he decided to come back. "Thank you, thank you, thank you," the woman said as we escorted her to her neighborhood. "I was so scared, I don't know what I would have done. Thank you." A and I bashfully accept her thanks and we part ways shortly there after and head home. Once A and I get back to our own neighborhood and the adrenaline has decidedly subsided, I stop her, "That could have ended soooooo badly. Oh my god." "I know, but if that were me, I would hope someone would do the same thing." We all talk about what we hope we would do in a situation like that, and truthfully I don't know what I would have done if A hadn't led the charge. But lucky for all, A was and is a total badass.Summary:
Summarize: Damn, got here pretty late. Well once at some point between kindergarden and 4th grade (I forget, we had recess still is the point though). Well a girl I liked wanted someone to push her on the tire swing (looked like this . Well apparently this worked really well because she flew off a good ways, and started crying. I just noped the fuck out of there.Summary:
Summarize: I once got into an argument with my mom. I had homework to 'send a letter ordering an item from a catalog'. Being a total fucking nerd, I thought 'Great! I was going to order new lead figures for D&D anyway, I'll just kill two birds with one stone'. So, I write out 'Please send me 1 each of item #XXXX, #YYYY, and so on. My mother decides she's going to 'check my homework', and starts going nuts. She tells me I'm doing it wrong because the example we were given was for ordering sweatshirts or some shit, and had colors and all that. It got ugly. She's yelling 'You're supposed to say you want Item X in Yellow, with Red stitching!', and I'm saying 'Mom, you're a fucking retard! They're lead! They only come in one color, you're just ruining my fucking homework! Leave me alone you stupid bitch, you barely got your GED!' She tore up my homework. I never turned it in, or ordered the lead figures. I also never did homework in front of her again, and never showed her my report cards again. She was literally shocked to learn I'd been accepted to college, since she'd assumed I was failing all through school, and too ashamed to show her my report cards from 6th to 12th grade.Summary:
Summarize: Worms. I don't think you understand how deeply rooted this phobia is. I will go out of my way to change sidewalks if I see a worm in the street. If there is a worm in the room (or somewhere I can see) I MUST flee. I would miss a test, a job interview, a lottery prize if there was a worm near. I hate the beach because I could touch a worm when I'm barefoot in the sand. I literally cannot sleep if I think about a worm. I feel them creeping in my skin and must find something else to do. I cringe when I type or read the very word "worm". When the Yu-Gi-Oh! fad started, some of my friends gave me a deck for some secret santa, and I got the standard, basic Yugi deck. There was a worm warrior card with a very graphic image of a worm, which I immediately threw on the floor, picked it up in such a way that it would face against me so I could not see the drawing, and took it to the bathroom and burned it with a friend's lighter. I refused to give it away in the slim chance someone would use it in a game with me. In the fifth grade, a piece of the roof fell next to me*, and some larvae fell on my desk. Now, larvae aren't really worms, but I hate them all the same. In that same note, centipedes aren't worms either, and again, I hate the fuck out of them. So, this huge nest of larvae (as I remember it, my friends say it was just ONE larva that fell on my desk) fell on my desk, and I must have made some kind of record, because I didn't even know it and I was already outside of the room. The teacher was angry because she didn't know what had made me leave the classroom, but I explained and she calmed down. Which proved to be futile when she was enraged again when I refused to be in that classroom any more, even after they disposed of the larvae and offered me a new seat. They had to call in my parents to pick me up. When I was 13 or around that age, my cousin threw a worm on me. My cousin was a bitch. She knew I didn't like worms, but maybe she was just curious of how much I hated them. I screamed in some ear-breaking frequency, got it off me as if it were AIDS-infected blood on top of an open wound, and ran as fast as I could into the beach house. I had to cross a busy street to get to my house, but I didn't give a fuck about being killed. When I got into the house I found some hose and scrubbed the place it touched me until I drew blood in some sort of obsessive Macbeth-like washing panic. And I only stopped because my parents found me there, hyperventilating and scratching at my torso like a madman.Summary:
Summarize: While the changes also seem a bit excessive to me, I think the intentions are good(Plat 2 ADC main and I FUCKING HATE PANTHEON). Its in line with how they are treating long range ults as a whole(TF, Noc etc.). The problem is 100% the lack of counter play to Pantheons post 6 play. It just too face roll to press R from across the map and double kill bot lane. I think they should remove all changes except the ult range. This will allow lanes to ward appropriately to prevent him from ganking, but still allow him to punish lanes that don't invest the resources in vision.Summary:
Summarize: Those who frequent RDD on indiaspeaks will know what this post is about but still allow me to fill you in about what went down last night. There i was in RDD where hyodo wrote something about prophecies and fortune tellers, so i commented "whats my future in this sub?" to which another user asked for a pic of my palms. Now pls to note, i didn't know this user has the mental capacity of a retarded 3 year old who will get so so so offended by a pic of jizz in someone's hand that he will go and cry to the mods about how its "sexual harassment". WHAT THE FUCK! You're terming a pic which i posted just to elicit some laughs with no malice in my heart towards you as sexual harassment? The pic was taken down within 5 minutes of me posting it and i also apologised to the mod as well for not tagging it as NSFW. Still nothing to lose my shit over even though this guy accused me of sexual harassment . But then this assole instigates me by telling another user what a loser i am. So its not just enough that he accuses me of a serious crime like sexual harassment but he also wants to bash me on the thread as well,main chutiya toh hun nahi ki iski sunnunga so i hit back at him all the while trying to be a a little civil(at first) but ofcourse like the child he is, he retorts back with "randi madarchod..feed your jizz to your mom" Umm, so this is not as offensive as the pic i shared? Considering its not r/bakchodi. So fast forward a few minutes and this guy goes on to write one long ass para basically telling me that my parents hate me,my friends dont like me, how im a "piece if shit" punk teenager blah blah, but what really got his goat was that he failed to rile me up and even got called out on his remarks by another user. This fucker goes to town about how he was "offended",how it was sexual harassment, how it was some user who uses different alts to harass him etc etc. and he not only messages all the mods but also keeps telling all other users this through PM. Pls to note while all of this is going on, im still clueless about it. Its only this morning when a mod messaged me that i got to know the whole story. And if it hadn't been for this mod, i would've already got banned without so much as hearing my side of the story. Pls to note again,the pic was taken down within 5 minutes so majority of the people have no idea what it was and this fucker(crybaby) takes full advantage of this and tells everyone that it was a self taken pic(implying i jerked off,took a pic and then posted here) and everyone just laps it up. Pitch forks were out and they wanted to ban me all based on hearsay and what this "offended" little fucker told them. Isko toh randia ka mod bnao bhaiyio, apt hain. Gets offended easily, is quick in reporting to mods and obviously a chutiya.Summary:
Summarize: I've been waiting to share this story since I joined Reddit. It's a bit of a novel but to this day my words and actions are checked because of this event. All having to do with an event that happened back in the 5th grade day... I had come home from school one day and overheard one of my friends using the word prostitute (I think it was a South Park episode that he had watched). So I, being the naive sheltered kid started using the word and soon enough it had become an integrated part of my vocab. I was at a golf camp that summer for kids ages 8-14. I was playing a match against my friends little 8 year old brother and when something would not go my way I would say "Wow... what a gay prostitute." I had called him a "gay prostitute" a bunch of times throughout the course of the round, not really thinking anything of it because hey, I had no idea what it meant and they were just words. Fast forward two days later... I'm in my room building the Imperial Tie Fighter lego kit and I hear my mom SCREAM my name from downstairs telling me to get downstairs immediately. The usage of the middle name was the dead giveaway that I was FUCKED, but I digress. I see both of my parents at the foot of the stairs and my Dad looks me dead in the eyes and says: "So you think you're a big tough guy huh?" I replied with a shaky "What?" to which he responded "Don't give me that 'What' shit" (my parents don't swear so this was a huge 'this is how I die' moment). My mom was crying and told me to get in the car. She told me she had received a call from my friends dad who told me the little brother had been brooding in his room since that day. His dad asked him what was wrong and he asked his dad what a "gay prostitute" was. They had to have a family meeting to discuss what had happened, decided to notify the golf course of the event, and notify my parents. We drove 4 minutes down the road to his house where his entire family were outside waiting for me. I have never been so sorry about anything in my whole life. Those two words had ruined his innocence. I cried in front of his whole family and my mom and begged them to forgive me. Which they did. I also got a call from the Head Pro saying she wanted to have a meeting with me and told me that her initial reaction was she wanted to bar me from playing in the rest of the camp but his family kindly said that was a little extreme. Looking back on this event it I know this 100% changed me and helped make me who I am today. I've bumped into them a couple of times since (no longer living by me) and I feel so awkward and awful many years later. I wish I could take those words back but younger me needed a reality intervention quick.Summary:
Summarize: That's an indicator on your enemy that shows you that they are currently stunned. Not one that shows when your bear stance can stun that same target again. Apparently they something of that sort for Yasuo's E. At the moment you have to either get a feel for the cooldown, randomly guess, or count 6 seconds to switch back to bear stance and auto them again. And you obviously lose a shit ton of DPS if you happen to fuck up the timing on stance switching and aa to get the stun off a second time.Summary:
Summarize: Hot or ugly? Yeah, you definitely came out on the good end of that one, no contest. Even without makeup you're better looking than most people.Summary:
Summarize: That most people are in the relationship for personal gains and that people run from good things. First gf was fucking awesome. Up until she dropped me. Went from hanging out everyday and being madly in love to two text conversations and ultimately her pulling all the way out of my life. A few of the reasons she did this was because she had (self-diagnosed) chronic stress and when we got 'intimate' she would feel sick (is this a symptom?) Also because I didn't have a job and was unsure I would ever get one..we were fucking sophomores, you can't expect me to have my life planned out ahead of me Lauren!Summary:
Summarize: Sharing things on Reddit (and the internet in general) can be hard. Some people react so strongly and negatively, like the people calling your family a piece of shit. They are your family. You've eloquently spoken of your unconditional love for your dad. You might not do things the same way he does, but you accept him for who he is. There are some people who post, who legitimately dislike their families. Those people probably agree with the comments that their families are shit or whatever. Then there are posters like you, who commented that your dad was quirky, gave a description of part of his personality that fit in context with the question being asked, and made it clear that you love your family very much. Those people, the ones who love their families, don't want to hear the judgment of others who have a small piece of a big picture. The cruelty and judgment is hurtful and makes it difficult to post openly, seriously, and honestly in the future. I admire your unconditional love and acceptance of your father for who he is. I don't think he sounds like a piece of shit. He sounds quirky and free-spirited. He sounds like the kind of guy you could have an interesting conversation with or someone you could watch and see a different world view than your own. I don't think your step-mom or whatever you call her sounds like a doormat. She sounds like an amazing, loving, open-minded individual. You are lucky to have people like that in your life from whom you can learn so much. They might not do things the way you do, but they give you a different perspective on life.Summary:
Summarize: I'll never see any real reward for my work. I don't like women, so I'm never getting married or having a family of my mine. Literally nothing I accomplish will ever mean anything to anyone. In 50 years, everyone who knows me will likely be dead. Thus, I see zero reason to put myself through the bullshit of 'making something of myself', or 'earning a living' or whatever other bullshit society says I'm 'supposed' to do. So, I'm probably going to kill myself. Society can burn in hell. People are free to believe in the bullshit notion that hard work is meaningful and that you have to work to live. At the same time, I'm free to choose to kill myself, and there's not a damn thing anyone can do about it.Summary:
Summarize: Hey everyone. Okay. Here's the short of it. I was in a MMF poly triad until about two months ago. They were and established couple and I joined. This was a little less than two years ago. About two months ago, one of the partners broke up with me, and we changed to a V formation. Now, the same partner who broke up with me is telling our boyfriend that he's never been poly, that he feels awful all the time, and that I'm a threat. Keep in mind, they live together, have joint finances, and are engaged. I almost never see my boyfriend unless his boyfriend is at work or gone. I'm not much of a threat. So, now our boyfriend is basically being given the ultimatum by his boyfriend. He's forcing him to choose between us. This is the one major thing I've been afraid of the entire time we've been dating, because there is no question about who my boyfriend will choose. He will choose his boyfriend, not me. So, r/polyamory, what do I do? Do I hope that somehow this will all work out? Or do I cut and run, since I'm not sure that even if we managed to patch this all up that I could ever trust that I have some measure of security, or that there's any chance I'd be allowed to see my boyfriend? I feel like their relationship is unhealthy, and have for a while. My head's telling me to leave this hot mess, but my heart's been in love with this man for two years now. Any advice?Summary:

Summarize: Okay this article is full of misleading, agenda-packed, political crap. Here's why. The article describes how automated exchanges like NASDAQ encourage liquidity, and they do this by interpolating volume a little, and in this particular case, the market demand for some symbol. If the demand is interpolated as "increasing", it starts ramping up the buying of said symbol from the ask queue in order to have inventory to sell to expected high bid volume. As hard as this is to believe, this is actually necessary and smart, and if done efficiently, isn't even that big of a deal, which is why it amounts to 0.56% difference for a $1.4M volume.Summary:
Summarize: As someone who has 25 hours on mercy i have to say that most soloq teams are just fine as long as you know how to play mercy. You died? 80% of the time that's just bad positioning on your part. Yes, there is the occasional horrible team out there, but lets be honest, most of them aren't half bad. Instead of thinking about how horrible your team is, try thinking about what you're doing wrong that's getting you killed a lot. Also remember that your pistol ^^Deals ^^a ^^surprising ^^amount ^^of ^^damage isn't completely useless, and you can usually kill that tracer/genji if your aim isnt horrible. A widow is constantly asking you to heal her? Well how about, I dont know, healing her? Just because someone is asking you to do your job, doesn't mean they're being jerks.Summary:
Summarize: My [now ex]girlfriend I was dating (for about a year and a half) would tell her dad about us having sex. One night while we were eating dinner with her family, someone said something along the lines of being exhausted from work. She then blurts out word for word "Yeah, I couldn't even move this morning cause Zach (me) was really rough with me last night"...Her dad pulled me aside later on and told me he was going to blow my fucking head off if he found out about us screwing again. Needless to say, I broke it off about a week after.Summary:
Summarize: well sup this is my first post so yeah if it sucks sorry in advance Well I'm going to get straight into this i'm 13 at the time and my friend ( changed name ) ''john'' is about the same ages one day i was really sad and depressed and said fuck this i'm going out for a cycle then about a few mins down the road i see my friend john he is out playing football nothing different or strange about him at that point so i went up to him said hi ect talked about metal gear you know friend stuff ? and I told him how i was feeling and he was like ''bro bro bro bro '' my brother ( about 16 at the time ) got this stuff that could help you out man I thought about it for a second and said .. um okay so i went inside and played some ps3 as I was waiting for him when he came back he had rolled joint and i said fuck no i'm not gona smoke that man no way. so at that point another friend ''bob'' enters and then bob and john pass it back and forth,back and forth ( they didn't pressure me into it ) and when i saw how happy the two of them where and I was feeling really shity I thought to my self I don't want to feel shit so i took it and bam it hit me and i coughed and then passed it hit it again and nothing happened so the next day I was also down in the dumps so I hit it again we where listening to music and i could FEEL it like a visualizer ? and everything seemed different taste, touch and sight was a lot different but I swallowed some and when I burped smoke came out i guess its cool but i got sick so that wasn't any fun (and btw it did make me feel better i have read if you feel depressed and smoke it makes it worse but not for me i guess im lucky :L ) i don't do it all the time only when i'm feeling really shity ( messed up family ) i don't do it much for the sake of it but the feeling of ''been high'' but yeah the experience is good i guess, all my senses are enhanced witch is a good feeling my friend ''john'' is the person who gives it to me for free now (i'm now 15 ) anyway yeah sorry if that sucked it was my first post so yeah xDSummary:
Summarize: How DARE gay people not want straight people in gay spaces that they feel safe in all the time! Most gay folks are more than happy to have straight people come in as the OP of the thread said, but the nasty truth is, sometimes gay people just want to be around other gay people. It's not really a sex thing (although that's part of it) - its a culture thing. I mean, think of it this way: for the sake of example, let's say you're a member of Faith A, and you've been invited to visit your Faith B friend's house of worship. You're welcome to come as a guest, listen, observe, be polite, etc. In fact, most places will welcome you with open arms. But let's say that you start inviting more and more of your Faith A friends to this Faith B house of worship, because you enjoy it so much. At what point does it cease to be a space for Faith B people? There are no gay houses of worship, and the cultural centers are few and far between and usually only in major cities. For gay folks, gay bars serve this purpose - as a community center, as a place to be themselves in their culture, and yes, as a place to meet like-minded people. They're really vital. And having a drunk bachelorette party there to gawk at the sideshow really dehumanizes gays in their own space.Summary:
Summarize: Hey there everyone :) My name is Maeve, I'm 17 and MTF. For the past 11 years, I've known I was trans, and the feelings have only grown stronger and stronger. I still live with my parents, but I'm getting to that point of suppressing my emotions that I'm starting to feel like I can't keep on living like this. My mom won't allow anything of any kind until I'm done with college in 4 years [including name changes, clothing, hormones, the whole bit] I just dont know what to do anymore. I've talked with her countless times but she just won't listen. Any and all advice would mean the world. Thank youSummary:
Summarize: First of all those are very shitty Vape devices, if your gonna vape get something that will last a while and provide a good vape experience like the Aspire Premium Kit or something, or and Aspire Atlantis with a mech mod. Second do you smoke? if so the best argument is that you will be doing a far more healthy activity then smoking and it will generally cost less. If you do not smoke then why are you trying to get into vaping? Why can't you wait until you are 18? I am not against kids who are hooked on smokes switching to vape but if your not already a nicotine addict there is really no good reason to start especially when you won't be able to leave the house with it without getting crap from cops and random people when you use it in public.Summary:
Summarize: A quasi manager at a callcenter I'd worked at needed the phone number of a fellow employee, my ex. I'm lazy so I threw the ex on the to: field so I could type the number without having to remember it. I also included a statement to not inform her where he got the number from because she was being an unruly bitch. I forgot to delete her from the to: field.Summary:
Summarize: I can't really comment on your style and which toe is better, but hopefully I can explain their weird sizing. On the US Standard (same as Allen Edmonds) size chart, I'm a 9.5E. My 9.5 in Clarks fit well, but do seem to be cut pretty wide. My Thorogoods at a 8.5EE are just about right, I was considering going down to a 8EE, but worried they'll be too short. Thorogood does have a size chart and they fit like clown shoes, easily an inch and a half extra in the toe box.Summary:
Summarize: destitute steal... No. Destitute people will find a church or shelter, work odd jobs, or sit on a corner taking handouts from charitable passersby. People who think society has somehow harmed them, and who feel the urge to retaliate, steal. The decision to steal is often aided by cultural factors. If the people one looks up to act like it's okay to steal, that person is probably far more likely to perform said act. Additionally, if a person is constantly told that society is at fault for his or her plight (in this case, destitution) and that society has a duty to make reparations for said offense, that person will soon begin to agree. And when there is not enough compensation to support a desired lifestyle, the payee may become resentful and resort to things like stealing to make up the difference. ... Now, since you see no pattern, I shall point out an example of why some people (though not nearly as many as I think people believe) might clutch their purses a little tighter when they see a black person approaching. Skin color obviously has no incidence on any of those things you mentioned. However, as I pointed out, culture can. One particularly prevalent modern American subculture happens to be populated largely by black people. This section of society likes to produce a type of music--we'll call it "rap music"--that is well known for its anti-authoritarian skew. Phrases like "don't snitch" and "fuck tha police" are bandied about almost as frequently as references to "niggas" and "hos." Sadly, people like this are role models for a vast portion of America's youth, especially those who are black. Their brand of music has become quite mainstream and receives countless laurels from the most popular music awards shows. Now I understand there are plenty of exceptions to this anecdote. Perhaps most rappers don't partake in suggestions of violence and glamorization of life as a "gangsta." The most successful ones certainly do. In other music genres there are occasional violent performers (Rage Against the Machine, for instance), but they are generally not all that mainstream. They don't get the same following the big (and Lil) rappers do, so the chance that one of their listeners taking their lyrics seriously is significantly smaller. There is also the occasional successful white rapper or white rap music listener, but the majority are not. All of these coincidences involving black majorities can come together to form a rather scary picture for the person who sees his or herself as helpless against violent people. The point is, there is a definite pattern that is amply demonstrated outside of the bounds of statistical noise. Using past observations and forming assumptions about stereotypes has likely been a major evolutionary advantage in our recent past. For example, if a newly encountered creature has features previously observed on a large hungry cat, it is probably also a cat and probably also wants to eat you. Other animals do it too. Sharks sometimes mistake people for tasty, tasty seals because they appear to have the stereotypical features of a seal. ... I might come back to this tomorrow, but right now I forget what I was typing every time my head hits the desk (I'm tired). My critical thinking skills are kaput.Summary:
Summarize: Been there. Take it as a positive. Personally, i do not think that i would be willing to marry someone after 6 months, and it would be a fault of my character if i did so. The way i look it is: You have a 50:50 shot of marrying the person you truly love (with divorce rates and what not). So before i take that 50:50 bet, i want to be 100% sure that i am willing to make it. (Or i am prepared for the consequences if it does not work out)Summary:
Summarize: So today started off with a trip to a local B&M to pick up some juices and a drip tip. I went with my "friend" who the day before had "accidentally" taken my igo-l, a bottle of vermillion river e-juice and a few other things. I called him and he said "oh yeah I have those, my bad" and i picked them up last night. I also noticed that I was missing an igo-w deck and my RSST. today when he came over I gave him a chance to "find" my rsst and stuck my head under my bed to "look" for it. (the whole area under my bed is filled with boxes so I was acting like a mime) Lo and behold, he finds the RSST. He had also traded me a Nimbus for an AGA-T (he got it in a 10 pack deal for $30) The thing is, I am in recovery and work at a drug and alcohol treatment center, and the nimbus deck had some weed resin left in there and it had made it's way under the center post. I told him (because he had purchased 2 nimbus') that I'd love it if we could switch out the bottoms, and he agreed. so that night he gave me the new bottom cap and of course! it doesn't fit! the nimbus top cap was too loose. turns out it was an igo-w bottom, which if you recall I was also missing. So now I have everything he stole from me and today we go to the B&M. The guy confirmed it was an igo-w bottom, and my buddy said "oh okay dude I'll get you the other nimbus bottom" and we proceed to drip some juices (standard g35 and space jam omega are delicious on an igo-w) I buy the juice in 6mg for dripping and 18mg for everything else (i'm trying to quit smoking and 12mg leaves me craving analogs) I also buy my buddy some juice. on the way back home, I ask my "friend" to grab the nimbus cap and he says it's at his house, so I get to his place and I ask him to go grab it for me and he starts coming up with excuses ("my roommate is asleep and she's a bitch", "i have it in a tackle box but also literally all over the apartment") I tell him I think it's shady and he's like "bro, i'll totally get it for you tonight by 7" So i get home and take a 3 hour nap and it's 7. no call. 8. no call. 9. no call. 10. no call. 10:15 he hops on facebook and says he's gonna look for it and i can swing by and grab it. He signs off and I still havent heard from him. I'm at work right now, and the ekowool i just bought for my drippers isn't tasting good. the protank2 I just bought has a metallic smell and taste that the original protank did not. Every juice i put in it is horrible. my igo-w is shot, and now i'm left here with a pack of reds (which i love right now, more than ever.) I'm in a mood where I'm over vaping altogether and I fucking hate it. I just needed to vent, say what you will, anything is appreciated.Summary:
Summarize: edit: Holy shit, this isn't a "little something." This is a damn essay! Just little something I wanted to add, even though I'm not from outside America. I'm from New Jersey. (Yes, get all those "NJ is ass!" jokes out of your system.) I realize you all will have a skewed perspective of our state, given the shit like Jersey Sore, but try and keep an open mind about what I'm about to say. Like a lot of the other comments here, the stuff I love about living in America are the incredible friendly people, the complete craziness of the lengths we go to show each other a good time, all the food, the ability of us to melt together as one people despite our international origins, and Costco. No, seriously, Costco's a big one. I'll get to that at the end. I live in Edison, NJ. We're pretty big, a lot of Asians, Indians, Hispanics, African Americans, EVERYONE. Take a look around town and you're just as liable to see a Russian as a Filipino. Just a decade ago most schools in the area were predominantly Caucasian. Today? The vast majority of students are from Asian countries like China or Korea, as well as Indians and Filipinos. African Americans and Caucasians are still a big part of our community, despite being from different places. I know there's a lot of supposed "racial profiling" and "discrimination" because of skin color, but here in the tri-state area? (NJ, NY, PA) There's almost nothing. Everywhere I've gone to, people accept you for who you are. They don't care if you're straight, bi, gay, black, white, yellow, female, male transgender, WHATEVER. They look you straight in your eye with a smile on their face and ask you, "Hi! How are you doing?" It brings a smile to my face. The sincerity, the simple gesture of goodwill. It really helps a grey, rainy day. I've gone to conventions in NYC where people just wave you over and start talking and laughing with you. I've bumped into other photographers and, instead of simply nodding and walking away, actually put down our cameras and shake hands, taking a moment to enjoy each others' company. Of course, having some common ground helps, but the way they explore your personality without getting too personal is amazing. Of course there's tons of drama between people, over boyfriends stolen and personality conflicts, but these get resolved, and the friendships repair themselves. Americans forgive. They may not always forget, but they do forgive. This is a major part of what makes life here good. If you apologize to someone, most of the time they'll give you a smile and tell you, "It's okay. It was only an accident!" You both smile big grins and share a laugh, and go on with your day a bit brighter than before. It astounds me that Americans can be friendly even in the wee hours of the morning. I was on a return trip from Taiwan when we stopped in Anchorage for a layover. We waited on line for customs, when we heard laughter. The customs officers were joking around with the people at their stalls. (Keep in mind this was 2:00 AM, and we were all tired and cranky from a 17 hour plane ride.) The line shortened, and when it was my turn and I walked up to the desk, my customs officer - big, burly, with a kick-ass mustache - did something I wouldn't forget. He made a weed joke. No, seriously, a weed joke. I don't know why but he did, and the two of us just cracked up laughing. He asked the usual "Business or Pleasure" and I told him I was back for a wedding, he grinned a big one and started chatting with me about the beauty of weddings and the fun we have at them. It's moments like these I'm glad I live in America and not somewhere else where queuing is a necessary, joyless act. Another great part about Americans is our attitude towards life. I have an older brother who, by all intents and purposes, is smart. REALLY smart. He went to Rutgers Pharmacy, came out with a PharmD in 6 years, turned DOWN a $100,000 job to do a $75,000 job at a medical advertising company doing something he loves. (I know 75,000 is still a lot, but keep in mind that for a pharmacist, this is low.) If he were in Taiwan, for example, he would've gone to the more profitable job even if it meant mindless work and simple tasks that he hated and despised. In America, we learn to think differently. We don't always do things for the money; rather, we do things that we love. Recently, the director of Restrepo was killed. It's a terrible tragedy, but notice he was doing something he loved. I know this isn't just restricted to Americans, but it is a major defining point. We chase our dreams, our goals; that is what drives us. Oh, I mentioned Costco, too, right? Well, that's because Costco helped put my brother through college by offering him a job while he went to school for about three-times the minimum wage ($22.00/hour!) and helped schedule him around his classes. I know this is a regional thing, but still, it's a good thing to point out. The incredible quality of good, almost ridiculous return policies, and the amazing Food Court help, too.Summary:
Summarize: Started off drinking with my best friend in the corner of the room. Shots were had. Ended up in a bedroom kissing a chick who was definitely DTF. Best friend comes in and says my ride home has arrived. Kiss goodbye and the very drunk me falls down the stairs. Best friend tells me it's a joke. Puked in my stairs outside, haven't seen my frozen puke yet.Summary:
Summarize: I'm not denying that the world is warming. I'm just not freaking out like you idiots. bigot: one obstinately and irrationally, often intolerantly, devoted to his own church, party, belief, or opinion That would be you.

Summarize: It is a pejorative for selling that which should not be sold, selling to those that should not be sold to, and going to lengths to make oneself attractive specifically to those that should not be attracted. This applies to male prostitutes as well. "Whore" is usually used synonymously with "slut." Whatever else the words mean, they are widely held to be a way of "shaming" assertive women, particularly those who are sexually assertive. I appreciate that this is what you mean when you say, "whore," it is not what the majority of people will think when they read it. Combined with her level of sexual activity and whatever she may or may not get in return for it being completely irrelevant to her appalling crime, it sounds like you're not just "slut-shaming" (god I hate that phrase but it's appropriate here, in that I'm pointing out what others, especially women, will infer) but piling on as well. >And you mean to tell me you'd not have called me out for calling her that?! I don't believe that for a microsecond. Probably. But I think the part you're missing here is that I'm not trying to "call you out"-- I personally took no offense. I'm trying to call your attention to how your words come across. >it is horribly offensive for you to reduce this cause to that of a PR campaign. I didn't mean to "reduce" it to anything. Everything you just mentioned will only be gotten through winning hearts and minds, both of men and women who have been fed this kind of thing so long that the men's rights stances on these issues, as sane and rational as they are, seem like extremist anti-women positions. You guys need to get more men on your side than just the ones who have been through the hell of a false rape accusation, losing their kids, or being taken to the cleaners in divorce court.Summary:
Summarize: Several faculty members quit last semester because of her. Another (whose been there since the schools start) is retiring after this semester because of the way she's treated him and others. The Dean is, for lack of a better term, a pussy. He will believe whoever is standing in front of him at the moment and typically doesn't have anyone's back. The Department Chair is an idiot. There's really no way around it. She absolutely cannot do her job, and everyone knows it. So, I don't think she'll be Department Chair next school year. As far as professional goes, no, I do t think she'd have any impact on either of us. For me, this is really only a job and not a career. I like teach there, but I also have my own theatrical performance troupe, and do secretarial work at a local church. I love those jobs as well. My career is being a Mom. I just need some jobs to cover our bills. For my husband, he's not particularly career oriented either, though working there is much more a career for him than me. He's also been there since the school's beginning and he is a favorite both of students, faculty, and staff. He's working on his doctoral degree from the local University and basically gets free tuition since he teaches at the college. But, he's ready to move on. Frankly, our college is a terrible place to work, with or without the Department Chair. He's never had a raise and makes barely enough to support himself, let alone a family. Anyway, sorry for the diatribe/rant!Summary:
Summarize: I was lying in bed one morning, naked. I knew my period was coming up pretty soon, but since I'd gone off of the pill a couple of months before, I didn't know exactly when. I got up to use the washroom, and as I was walking, I felt it. My period was here. I started running, which in hindsight was the worst thing I could've done, since the motion caused the blood to "shoot" out of me in a huge red streak across my carpet. I managed to get to the bathroom and tampon up, and then quickly started to scrub the carpet. All while completely naked.Summary:
Summarize: You'd be surprised how easy it is to accidentally show nudes of yourself to family members. Occasionally I cut my own hair. I'm black so I have that kinky hair and when I cut it I usually buzz off 99% of it. But when you're cutting it that short, it's very noticeable if one spot isn't as even as another. Think of it like shading with a pencil and pressing harder in one area than another. Being a stereotypical young dude, the only mirror I had was the mirror on my wall. So getting the back even was a little more difficult. I'd just use my phone and either snap pictures of myself, or the back of my head through the mirror just so I could see everything looked normal. This would also be done naked so I could just hop in the shower when I'm done to wash off any hair bits. One time... I forgot to delete these photos. Fast-forward to some arbitrary time in the future. I'm out with my family + aunt, uncle and some cousins. I'm showing my aunt, who is a fairly proper quietish person, some photos on my phone and just give her my phone to go through them. She got quiet and just gave my phone back rather quickly and I thought nothing about it. A few weeks later, I'm going through my phone and I come across these photos of me taking photos of myself naked in front of a mirror and burst out laughing. The leading one was taken from up behind my head so you got to see my whole backside, and the reflection of my front side in the mirror. Now it's a funny family story.Summary:
Summarize: As we are yes, I can see corruption soiling even the best system that could possibly exist overtime. But a battle without end, is one still worth fighting. Like the war on drugs and the war on terrorism? :P My original point was that any alternative we come up with will be corrupted. Sure, the human population has domesticated itself quite a bit and restrained those darker tendancies, but they will always be there and we can barely control them. There are quite a few atheists here who would outright destroy all religion if they had the chance. They weigh their own opinions more than the rights of millions of people. That's the same dark tendancies we despise in religion.Summary:
Summarize: In our first year we were having sex a few times a day, steadily declined to once or twice a month recently. I know my GF is really hot but I'm just hardly ever aroused by her and actually have to try hard to get in the mood, most of the time I'm imagining she is someone else anyway, I feel bad if I can't get an erection when she's obviously interested but I'm not feeling it. We love each other so much and are great friends, but we just aren't getting the sex that I know we both really crave, so the other night she suggested an open relationship. My initial reaction was that we should just split up if she wants to be with other guys, but after a couple of days of going over the idea in my mind I'm thinking it might not be such a bad idea. I'm not a super jealous person and If it is only about sex then I think i'd be ok with it. A few questions to those that have been in or are currently in open relationships: Do you allow sex between friends or people you already know such as friends from hobbies. Do you strictly keep it as 1 nighters or allow casual fuck buddies. How do you manage the locations, such as do you ever bring someone else home or is it always kept out of your own house. Basically we get along like a house on fire and are very loving and cuddly, but we are just missing sex in our lives. Any other suggestions, comments, questions welcome.Summary:
Summarize: My girlfriend broke up with me earlier today. We both still have feelings for each other and I'm fairly sure she will come back. But I am going no contact. So if she texts "are you okay?" Should I respond? I don't want to give in but I don't want her to worry if I'm dead or something you know?Summary:
Summarize: So, as the title says, this fall I will be relocating to Durham, NH to attend UNH as an incoming freshman. However, my girlfriend will be attending Plymouth State this fall. Both of us have full intentions to visit each other over the semester. The problem is, neither of us will have a car to drive to each other at any time during the semester. So, I am wondering what routes are possible for either of us to take when visiting each other. I already know about buses, etc., but UNH doesn't have a way to get to Concord, NH, which makes things very difficult. So, I'm wondering if any of you locals might know of a possible route that both of us could travel on to get to each other. We're open to all possibilities, and seeing as we will be broke college students, the cheaper the better!Summary:
Summarize: I was in a long distance relationship with a guy from England. He took advantage of my naivety and kind heart and would go dark on me for a few days/weeks at a time always apologizing when he came back. I cried every single day we were together because I felt I wasn't enough. He told me he was going through a hard time and I was finally able to get him to see a therapist. About a year and a half into our relationship, my family splurged and we went on a European vacation. My ex waiting until I was enroute to England and spending the night in Paris to break up with me via Skype. He said that he wasn't in the right state for a relationship but we could work at it and get there. Four months after that he fell off the face of the earth. I know that he wasn't the right guy for me and that I'm happier outside of the relationship than I was inside of it. But still...a year later a picture of him popped up and my anxiety level shot right up to where it used to be. I'm making myself sick with worry--about what, I'm not sure. I haven't had a serious relationship since and whenever I get close I start comparing. My ex was my first real relationship, first everything. How do I get away from this toxic memory and into a relationship of mutual care and respect?Summary:

Summarize: Okay, so I'm not trying to be a bitch here. I'm genuinely interested to know the reasons. Pretty much all of the engineers I've met at U of I are just so arrogant about it, and no offense, but you guys (as in the r/uiuc community) kinda come off that way too. It's like people who aren't engineers are just worthless. I know we're a great engineering school and all, but face it, the whole world can't be engineers. 1)We would die out because nobody would be getting laid and 2)There are more roles to be filled in society than engineering ones. Sorry for this. Just wanted to hear some other opinions. Also, kinda drunk.Summary:
Summarize: I actually had a gay porn scout try to recruit me once. Bad news, he's not going to get paid more than $500 to jerk off on camera. Guy on guy is $5000+ Girl on guy, the guy makes 0 dollars. My guess is they're really lowballing him for guy on guy, either that or he has a 12 inch cock, because that's the only way he'd make that kind of money for jacking off or as they call it "a sneeze shot". It's a very horrible business to get into. They fly you out of state, and once you get there, you're the porn companies slave until they send you home. You can't leave early, as they won't pay for the plane ticket. They try to make it sound like it's all fun and games... Kindof like a military recruiter. From what I hear, when you actually get there it's a nightmare. Ever seen those videos of pornstars having absolute breakdowns on camera? Well if you haven't, there's plenty of them out there. I have to stress the fact, that you're boyfriend is going to be tortured the whole time he's there. It's borderline rape. Kind of like "if you don't want to walk home from California to Florida put this dick your mouth". I will personally talk your boyfriend out of it if you want me to. It's a fucking nightmare in a half and I don't want those stupid ass gay porn people making money off of torturing someone. If he does decide to go through with it tell him DO NOT LISTEN TO ANYTHING THE RECRUITER SAYS.Summary:

I get home and as soon as I open the door I start taking my pants and my boxers off. I run to the hallway and then I notice my mother and father grabbing their TV I had borrowed. My penis hanging out them looking at me with TV in hand I run to my kitchen while they leave and I don't know if I should talk to them.Summary:

Summarize: Worst one I ever did: I was working for a Jersey Mike's Subs. I jumped the ranks really quickly and got put into a shift leader position so I could run the night crews (about one month after being hired). One night, one of the other leaders called and asked if I could cover a shift for him. I didn't have anything going, so I said yes. Turns out that was the shift from hell. We ended up getting literally twice as many customers as usual and the crew just barely kept their heads above water. The shift ends and everyone cleaned and closed quickly. We left the store and sat outside for the usual cigarette and bullshit session to help us come down from the day. Everyone kept telling me that Matt (the shift leader for whom I covered) owed me for this shift. I pulled out my phone and, being all stupid and macho, I texted him "You owe me your first born child and left testicle for that shift." It wasn't until I was on the road when I got curious as to why he hadn't replied that I checked the text (at a red light, of course....). I had everyone in my phone from work as "[first name] Jersey Mike's". I had meant to send the text to "Matt Jersey Mike's". Instead I sent it to "Mark Jersey Mike's". Mark happened to be the owner of a few local franchises, not the least of which was the one I worked at. I was mortified and texted him back immediately apologizing and explaining what happened. He laughed it off later and when I went off to school he reminded me that I owed him my left nut and first born child for hiring me and recommending me to the J-Mike's where I am now going to school.Summary:
Summarize: There is no public harm to vaccinated children This is so wrong I'm a bit flabbergasted if I'm being honest. Some people can't get vaccinated due to weakened immune systems and other diseases. Those people rely on what's known as "** herd immunity . Not only that, there are already cases of whooping cough outbreaks. Get this; the number of whooping cough cases in the United States back in 1991 was 2719. Do you know what it was in 2012? Nearly 50,000 . It's a direct result of the anti-vaccination surge that has occurred within this past decade or so. [Source.]( > I think the issue is with the poor and uninsured. The poor get their vaccinations at a significantly reduced cost thanks to obamacare and other other subsidies. In many states, they are free to the poor.Summary:
Summarize: HAHAHAHA, guys this was the most fucking pathetic thing that has ever happened. So I've got one of these urges right, like fuck. Somehow, my monkey brain convinces me to go look at some pictures, which obviously led to a video, then I'm like "just a couple strokes bro", don't worry nothing will happen < the biggest deception ever. Then I get aroused so quickly I'm like fuck, ok stop now, now now now. I stop and then its like OH SHIT man OH SHIT I can't hold this in, I'm gonna fucking premature ejaculate after like 20 seconds man, never have ever I ever felt so demasculated, nor have I lost this quickly. As it came out, I was just watching my dick unload itself, and started laughing hysterically, like almost dying. It was just like that, streak was broken. No war, no battle, just boom, I lost so quickly. It's like I lost to my monkey brain in chess through scholar's mate. It was sadly hilarious. All in the span of like 5 minutes, from the urge to the orgasm (wouldn't call it that, more like cum-release). Anyways bros, that monkey talking will try to convince you somehow that looking at 'the latest porn', 'just to be reminded', and all that rationalization is pure bullshit and a trick by your mind. You are your own worst enemy. This hilarious mistake tonight is probably one of the best experiences I could of asked for, I will never trust my mind with any of this bullshit again, I've gotten away with it a couple times but your mind is always out to get you. The best route to take after an experience like this is laugh, as you were fooled but you will not be fooled again! Feeling bad about relapsing is absolutely useless, no need to feel bad, you fucked up. Now you know, you regret doing it but you're better off now. Regret over remorse. This is all a process of learning bros, a process of learning about how your mind is out to get you. It's not just about the streak, it's about the discipline you have after you relapse. Do not relapse multiple times, this is the worst thing and its your monkey brain trying to drag you back into the darkness. Your mind WILL rationalize that 'since you already did it once, what difference does it make if I do it 8 more times today, I'll start the streak again tomorrow, what's the difference anyways'. This is DANGEROUS, you must realize that every single time you PMO you are fading to black. We all make mistakes, but continously making those mistakes is a sure-fire way to lose all motivation and all momentum. Anyways, best of luck and keep fighting bros. This isn't just about NoFap but about discipline. You are subconsciously disciplining your monkey mind each day that passes.Summary:

Summarize: I'm a 5th year HoH student and I don't sign at all. I can hear/speak pretty well and I don't hang out with other deaf people because of the stereotypes. I work at crossroads and people constantly come up to me and sign or just give me some wavy arm motion to try to indicate what they want because they assume that I sign, or they assume that I won't hear them if they try to speak, which really annoys me. Deaf people complain that hearing people think they are retarded. Some do and there is a good reason for it. All people learn to speak by mimicking what they hear, so you have deaf and hoh kids who don't hear anything, or they just hear stuff differently, so when they talk they have a deaf accent, or they just make loud hooting grunting sounds, to a hearing person, it sounds similar to the sounds retarded people make. True, it is the fault of hearing people for believing this sterotype, but it would be really nice if deaf and hoh kids would stop perpetuating this stereotype too. Personally, I stereotype hearing people based on the way I've seen deaf people treated. I may ask you to repeat yourself once or twice (or maybe more than that) but you don't need to shot at me.Summary:
Summarize: Honestly, I wanna contradict you. I am tired of the attitude pandering to people who are incompetent. If someone is new, respect them, if someone is learning, respect them, if someone is lagging, respect them! But for god's sake give no love to the idiots who pull wipe after wipe and still learn nothing. The people who think they are hot stuff and know exactly what to do. Lastly, it's not elitist to say "look up a guide", it's not elitist to say "Can we get this done in less than 2 hours", and it's not elitist to say "no beginners.". There is a good reason the average PUG intelligence is dwindling, and it's because anyone with half an interest in improvement is finding a static group. Sorry to rant, but the whole "Be nice to beginners" thing is slowly grinding closer to "tolerate trolling".Summary:

Summarize: Freshman year- My Gf and I had been out most if the night at a friends apartment making weed butter and then a bunch of edibles. Between all the butter that had gotten on us while we cooked and all the edibles we ate we are both sky high. We get back to my on campus apartment, nobody's home. My three roommates all stumble in loudly about 30 mins later drunk as hell, they had been a some party. We are sharing the stories of our nights when we suddenly hear a shriek from outside. We are all fucked up so none of us really react until we hear a girl running down our hall screaming "help help!" Me and my four roommates all rush outside, my gf and a couple other girls stay behind in the room. We get in the hall and this panicked girl is just sayin"upstairs upstairs please you guys have to do help!" We are all way too fucked up to know what to do so we all just bolt for the stairs and run up to the third floor. We throw open the door to the hall to just see the walls covered in blood. Like fucking everywhere in HUGE streaks across the walls and big semi-soaked in puddles on the carpet. Despite being high as shit I am the most sober one of the four of us so i took the lead and ran towards this writhing body on the ground, then notice there is a girl crying hysterically nearbye and some shirtless dude holding her. This kid we all knew is just in a heap on the floor, he has this massive gash on his head that is just hemorrhaging blood and there is this huge rock like two feet to his left covered in blood. So I grab the kid and using what training I can remember while I'm so fucked up my roommates and I try to to talk to him and carefully rolled him onto his back. Although the whole time he keeps trying to sit up and grab at the rock while making this just like guttural moan. " Jack (not his real name) what's going on?" "Unnnnnggggg" "Jack come on dude speak to me what the fuck happened." "Unnnnngggggg" roommates:"Steve what do we do?!?" "Shit, well if he can't communicate we don't have a choice call 911" (bear in mind we all liked this kid and new that if we called the paramedics and cops this would be it for him at school) roommates look at me hesitantly but say" alright FUCK" So roommate A runs off to call for help while B,C, and I try to piece together what's happening while stopping the blood from gushing out of jacks head. Shirtless dude" we were watching a movie and suddenly we hear a knock on the door, Girl went to answer it and as soon as she opened the door this crazy fucker just decked her in the face!" Although he didn't elaborate more we were never sure how much of the damage on jacks body was dealt by shirtless guy but I have no doubt it was more than a little. While he is telling this to roommate C I am looking jack over and that's when I look in his eyes to see they were dark red and had pupils the size of dimes" FUCKING SHIT! He's high out of his god damned mind!" Turns out elsewhere on campus earlier that night jack had eaten several candies laced with LSD and was tripping his balls off. So anyway at around that point two cops, one of which I had a bit of a history with suddenly burst into the hallway guns drawn. We all throw our hands up as we are being aimed at and so jacks head starts gushing more blood. "What the fuck is going on?!" Dick cop yells "Don't shoot! We found him like this, he needs attention now! Also I think he's on drugs because he is completely nonresponsive, and keeps trying to hit himself with that rock!" I shouted gesturing to the big bloody stone. The cops thankfully lowered their guns and holstered them but then dick cop pulls out his taser and starts threatening jack with it ordering him to get down and comply or be tased. Roommates B,C,and Start yelling" No STOP! He doesn't understand what your saying let us just hold him down he's fine he just needs medical attention!" "Back away from him NOW!" So we all stood up, pretty well covered in blood, and did as he said. Jack pulled himself towards the wall and leaned against it but roommate B grabbed the rock and moved it away from Jack, who still kept reaching for it and the cop kept threatening to taze him if he kept moving, not that jack understood. Eventually the paramedics arrived and carted away Jack, and treat the girl who got a huge black eye. Never heard from jack again personally but B did and he said that according to Jack he had no recollection of how he wound up in our building or why he punched the Girl, but that he kept hitting himself with the rock because he saw it as his brain and was scared if he didn't get it back into his head he would die. So ya that was the craziest thing I saw in college although I do have some other good stories as well. Always remember kids, drugs can be fun, but they can also be very very VERY dangerous.

Summarize: Class setup: (I have 11 different knife classes setup with every perk combination possible, but this was by far my most successful and fun) Specialist: Heat Wave (can't believe I am saying this but I may try Rejack to save the bloodthirstys, plus can finish his Hero gear maybe) Primary: None Secondary: Knife (duh) Explosives: None Tactical: Smoke Screen Perk 1: Sixth Sense & Flak Jacket/Ghost Perk 2: Scavenger & Tracker Perk 3: Tac Mask Playlist: Chaos Moshpit Hardpoint Ground War The knife is all I have left for Dark Matter. Last night in about in an hour got over 100 kills while having a blast. I tried all three of these gamemodes, and I got most kills on Choas while Nuketown Dom was picked almost every game. I was averaging easily 20 kills. Few games I had about 37 kills and 20 some deaths. I only went negative 1 game and that was on a safeguard game (not best option for knife kills). My Tactics: Spawn Run passed the house and throw both smokes in B dom area and middle Run through the smoke cover watching radar for dots and sixth sense and picking up extra smokes See a dot or sixth sense alarm turn and strike Throw more smokes in middle and if you are already in middle then right outside their house Go into their house hardscoping radar and wait (yes I know you have to be "that guy" but if they are going for DM or have gotten DM they will understand) get kills or get killed rinse and repeat It was so much fun just spamming smoke. If I wasn't getting killed much the entire middle was covered the entire time. No one had a clue what to do it was fantastic chaos. And my KD didn't suffer half as much as it did for the pistol's camo challenges. Hell it actually helped it in a few games lol. I am hoping tonight will be the night. Only 3 more bloodthirstys and I am done. The knife is a blast but when you are on 4 kills and panicking and radar shows a fifth victim and you swipe and it doesn't register its a huge nut punch. Like I said before I use heat wave and it is really good, but Rejack may actually be useful for once to keep the bloodthirstys alive since I have died many many times while having 4 kills. Just wanted to share my setup and experience finishing the knife because it was been probably the most fun to finish, especially after finishing the LCAR and RK5 fuck those things. The best part was littering the map with smoke and watching people not have a clue because no one uses smoke, let alone 3-4 cans of it a spawn LOL.Summary:
Summarize: How to kill a habit:** 1. Go to one of the secure places where you can practice the habit safely or where you get heavy triggers (make sure you're alone). 2. Do the ritual that you usually do right before the habit happens. 3. Stop yourself and scream loudly in your mind "No, No, No, I will never do It" don't use words like "can't/can" use affirmative strong words, "will" will do the trick. Clench your fists hit the bed (pillows, couch etc ..) hit your palms hard, knock hard on the wall, get tight and psyched as if you were going to fight or to do a big lift, repeat these patterns for a good 5 - 10 minutes, show yourself how bad you want to end this habit. 5. After a while repeat the whole process again (including the imitation of the ritual before the habit, that is the most important part , you have to get close to actually giving in). 6. You have to do this in every secure place that you used to/can practice the habit in. 7. The whole thing won't take more than 30 minutes of your time and if done right will rid you of the habit for a lifetime. **Science behind this trick:** - Your subconscious mind runs a series of submissive thoughts when you get triggered/are doing the deed, you can't catch yourself having these thoughts because your brain is flooding you with dopamine and you are busy "pleasuring" yourself. This process' whole purpose is to combat and overwrite this series of underlying thoughts with stronger resistant ones that are attached to strong emotion, the stronger the emotions the better you will remember how bad you want to end this habit later in your life if you fall victim to temptation. -** let yourself go , be mad, destroy things (not litterally but act like it), do fast explosive push ups or pull ups (if u can). The stronger and wilder the stance you take right before that ritual begins the better** your mind will remember this when you are about to do this habit unintentionally. - The reason you have to do this in every place that may potentially trigger desire to do the habit is simple: You have to make sure you overwrite every memory with this strong aggressive stance, that way you clearly remember the stance when your body aches for the dose. - If you can bring yourself to act like a mad man on a silly intuition like this (the notion that this may work), you can surely end this habit and you HAVE the will to do so. - For some reason you didn't do this thoroughly and passionately enough or life simply swallowed, chew and spit you up, and the motive to resist this time is weak. Simply repeat this trick again and strike 2 birds with one stone: -Strengthen the memory and stance you have taken. -Successfully avoid the relapse for one more day. There's noSummary:
Summarize: I had broken up with my ex a few weeks prior to this event. So anyway, I ended up at this party and got completely hammered, the ex was also there and tells me how her brother wants to beat my ass down, her brother was a big buff guy of age 19, when I was 16. I was feeling ballsy and dared her to call him and thought nothing of it for the rest of the party. End up having too much to drink, vomiting in the toilet, and the big brother at the door of the bathroom, I get up from my vomit-induced stupor and shake his hand with the hand I just used to force myself to vomit and apologised profusely to him (for no reason, I guess I go from ballsy to apologetic when I get super super drunk). He looked extremely confused and simply said ''It's alright :)'' with a smile just like that and left (he came to pick up my ex and beat me up)Summary:
Summarize: I think the thing that bugs people the most though is the Brand will be profiting off of his rather worthless commentary (But he's giving the money to charity! Yeah I'm sure he gets absolutely no slice of this whatsoever). The issue is a lot of the solutions people offer to the "Income Gap" just kind of pass the bill along. Not all, but a lot of stuff I see seems to imply that the wealthy need to pick up the bill for everyone. This is imposed through higher taxes on the wealthy (dont see how this will solve shit, now bureaucrats will just have more funds to sling around) and a gov't mandated higher minimum wage which would just cause expenses to go up and a handful of people to lose jobs while the other 80% have marginally better paying gigs. Personally, I'm pretty fiscally conservative, I think it's what makes America great, having the freedom to choose what gets done with our money as opposed to having the government (that hardly any of us trust) choose what to do with it. But I would be all for more available education to low-income families. I'm aware there's already a good amount of funding out there for those in need, and I don't think throwing money at this is necessarily the answer to the problem. But as someone who would be flipping burgers if it were not for my education I think it's an opportunity we should try to give to every american citizen. Fuck raising the minimum wage, fuck only increasing taxes on the wealthy, lets just equip our citizens to give back more to the economy and country. /rant sorry if this looks like it's directed at you /u/truwhtthugSummary:
Summarize: One thing to keep in mind, is that children are just as much beautiful and insightful as they are cruel and vile. Just like adults. Do everything you can to support your daughter's emotional well being. But keep in mind that some kids will be dicks to her because some kids are just dicks. If it wasn't her skin color it would be her clothing or the shape of her nose or sound of her voice. The important thing to keep in mind, IMHO, is that her experiences as a child, good or bad, comforting or painful, will forge her into the woman she will become. And I'm guessing, like most mixed race people I've known, she will grow to be an interesting and thoughtful human as the result of her experiences. Edit:Summary:
Summarize: I see that you are a glass half empty type of person. Suicide rates in Austrailia are around average. Take 2008 for example. In a population of 22 million, ([Source]( there were 2190 suicides ([Source]( By any stretch of the imagination, 2190 out of 22,000,000 is an extremely tiny number. You just need to look at the whole picture to see this. There are not so many people commiting suicide. It's a really small number. This is also not a fucking UNIVERSE OF SORROW. I personally do believe suicide is a tragedy in each and every instance, but don't try to take away from the feel-good nature of this story. Look at it this way: If this guy has saved 160 people over 10 years (lets just assume that it was 2190 per year), thats 160 out of 21,900, or 0.75% - an extremely significant number, especially considering he was doing it part-time, in one location. Don't be so quick to villify my respect for this individual or to feel good about good being done in the world simply because he isn't stopping everything. Edited to fix the links.Summary:

Summarize: Im a 23 year old girl in a big city, and I'm pretty typical. Stable home, cool siblings, modern lifestyle. Nothing about me screams "immoral slut". Except John. I met John in university when I was dating his friend. John and I had an immediate connection and it very quickly took over what I felt for his friend. We would talk for hours about any and everything. The mental and physical connection we have is indescribeable. Emotionally, however, there was never much there. We both realized soon enough that we had a thing for watching each other get off and we shared a mutual love for all things Tantra. I'll make this simple: With all of our other partners, we had to learn how to have an orgasm, ie: actively think about and focus until we came. With each other, it was the opposite. We had to fight to not orgasm a minute or so in. We are two sides of the same coin it seemed, our energy was parallel... even intertwined. Sadly, we lost contact. Fast forward 6 years and we meet up for coffee. Its like not a day went by since we last saw each other. He is now married, and I've been seeing someone for a few months. We know we want each other, there is not getting around this fact. He asks me if I believe there are certain people who are meant to be in your life... I do believe that. He asks me what I would do to keep those people in my life. I can see where he is going with this, we never want to stop being in each others lives. We don't want the conversations to end, the advice to stop, and the incredible moments of ecstacy to be lost. I know I should feel like this is wrong. He's married to a wonderful, beautiful woman. I'm seeing someone really hot (there's not much else to say for him TBH). He loves her, I know this... But I feel like a sociopath in that I cannot see whats so wrong with getting off with someone you feel so connected to and leaving it there. I've never felt any desire to date him or bring him to parties, dinner, etc... In spite of (and considering) all I've said, Reddit, should I stop? It should be noted that we take many precautions to ensure we are both clean (monthly check ups) and we very rarely have any sort of penetration. Safe sex = good sex!!Summary:
Summarize: Fucking asshole, full of himself in every way not full on, but just endless harping, you know? I put up with t for about two years. Then one day he takes my science folder from my locker and empties it. I was doing badly in school (completely unrelated to him) and was stressed out. I smacked his head against the locker and said 'I'm getting enough shit as it is, thank you very much.' I walked away victorious, then turned back realising I still needed to put everything back into my science folder. And lock my locker.Summary:
Summarize: She left me for the second time, saying I don't care. The idea of not caring about her kills me. I think I've accepted that I'm never going to see her again. Honestly, after 5 years, I love her too much to begin another relationship. Most people think that it's stupid to get hung up over a girl that doesn't care about me, as if she were doing fine. I know she's not fine though. I know she's suffering as much as I am. In other news, I'm flunking college again. I've applied to and interviewed for more jobs than I can count, but none of them can get past the idea that I haven't finished college. Even the part-time jobs aren't hiring. I have three days to decide whether to go back to school and I'm beginning to think I'm just going to end up going because I have no other choice. After her and I broke up I started seeing someone else in a non-romantic (not even really sexual) way. I messaged her today and she didn't answer, but I could tell she read it because the program tells me. Maybe I'm too lonely, but I expected a reply. I get it though. She's going through some depression too. I used to cut people off like I wasn't worth it but now that I'm actually reaching out to people, it seems that no one cares. Even when I reach out over the Internet. Tinder and the like offer only douchy gay guys (I'm not homophobic, just these guys are really douchy. I'm actually polysexual.). Reddit has yielded no results, after posting here and the advice column (I wasn't in the advice column for my depression, rather it was about getting into a second relationship with her). My family only wants to talk about getting a job, getting a psychologist, going to school... They don't care about my emotions or anything I need to talk about. They don't ask about my relationships. My stepmom thinks that once I get on medication, I'll magically feel better, because that was her experience, but I'm sick of everyone telling me that they understand. Understanding doesn't make me feel better, and no, they don't understand, otherwise they would know what I need from them. I'm going to talk to one of them about what I need from them today. Last but not least, let me talk about the purpose of this title. When it comes to people I don't feel regular emotions, it feels like. My ex has a point in saying I don't care, because I can see how she sees that. Truth is, I don't worry. People constantly need others to worry about them. I need emotional support, but I wouldn't wish anyone to worry about me. Yet people do it all the time. It's stupid. It's an unnecessary stressor on everyone, and for someone who stresses about everything, it's the least I need in my life, to have to worry about someone as if they're fragile toothpicks. What's more is that everyone worries about me all the time. I don't understand. I'm an adult. I'll be fine. What I need from people is to feel loved and emotionally taken care of, not for someone to pander over me like I'm going to break any second now. Anyway, enough rambling. Thanks for reading.Summary:
Summarize: So this fuck up actually happened a couple years ago, but just came to my mind and I thought I should share. A couple years ago I had just started my sophomore year of college and had finally moved out of the dorms and into a quaint townhouse with my close friend. I was so excited to finally have my own space, and with that space I found it was much easier to smoke the occasional bowl without fear of being reprimanded. Enter me with a nice new bag of ganja. I'm relaxing in my room on the second story of the apartment which happens to have a small balcony I can step out onto. I've managed to roll a pretty impressive joint, so I ask my roommate if he'd like to come smoke this work of art with me. He obliges and we step onto my balcony, making sure to shut the sliding door nice and tight so as to not let excess smoke into the apartment. We carry on talking for a while and decide to go back inside to play some Mario Kart. I turn to open the balcony door and after trying a few times to open it, it dawns on me that we have somehow locked ourselves out of the apartment (I still to this day don't understand how the door locked, as it is one of those latches that flips upwards and slots into a hole to lock. I can only assume I shut the door so hard that the latch flipped itself 180 degrees into its locking position). I immediately decide I will call my father who lives only 30 minutes away and see if he can come open our door for us since he has a spare key. He answers and says he will be right over. Phew, crisis averted. Suddenly I notice out of the corner of my eye the bag of weed sitting on my desk, with rolling papers right next to it. Now I'm freaking out. I can't have my dad see this when he comes into my room to open the balcony door for us. Instantly I call him back and tell him to abort mission as we have managed to jimmy the lock and are back inside. Phew, crisis averted. Shit, now what do we do. It's slowly getting chillier as the sun starts to set and we have not come equipped to deal with anything under 70 degrees. I throw an idea out to my roommate: lets call a locksmith and have him come unlock our door for us and let us in. My roommate then points out the fact that the locksmith will also undoubtedly see the weed on my desk and might not be 420 friendly. Shit. Ok, I'm not very athletic, but maybe I can lower myself off the balcony to the ground and after the locksmith opens the door I'll just come let my roommate in. In our impaired state we determine this to be the best course of action. I start to lower myself off and immediately freak out because the drop is way farther than I had anticipated. I climb back up and tell my roommate there's no fucking way and resign to kick the glass door of the balcony in and just pay the repair costs. He stops me and says he will do it, but agrees that it is definitely too far to fall without hurting himself. We have all but lost hope when a neighbor walks by coming home from work. She's a small girl, maybe 4'5'' at most. I don't pay her much attention, but my roommate sees something in her that I have not. He calls out to her and asks her if she has a ladder. She say's that she might and will be right back. She comes back out of her apartment with a nice fancy BIC lighter and asks "will this work?" Even though I'm quite distressed and starting to freeze my ass off I can see the humor in this miscommunication. My roommate does not and yells back "A LADDER, NOT A LIGHTER". Turns out she doesn't have a ladder. We explain the events that brought us to this point (minus the weed) and ask if she has a boyfriend or some guy living with her that could spot my friend as he drops off the balcony. She does not unfortunately, but she'd be happy to spot him, she was a cheer leader in high school! With the knowledge of this tiny girls cheer leading skills we proceed to lower my roommate off of the balcony. He is now about three feet under the balcony holding onto my arms and his feet are directly above the girl on the ground as he looks me dead in the eyes with fear I have never seen in my life and have yet to see matched and tells me to let him go. He drops rather gracefully and lands on the ground with no incident. The girl looks very confused about what just took place and says something involving 'pretty', 'short' and 'fall'. Her words go in one ear and out the other because all I can hear is the sound of my heart pumping faster than I knew was humanly possible. My friend looks absolutely ecstatic, like he just successfully parachuted out of a plane and stuck a 10/10 landing. I call the locksmith, he arrives, breaks my front door lock trying to get it open, spends about 30 minutes trying to open the broken lock, somehow succeeds by hammering the shit out of the lock and my friend rescues my frozen ass after 2 hours of sitting on the balcony. I pay the locksmith $70 for breaking my lock. The next day I pay the landlord $80 to replace the lock. That night I catch the tiny girl heading to her apartment after work and give her a $50 VISA gift card.Summary:

Summarize: I've been dating my girlfriend (will refer to as Emily) for over a year and a half. In the months of getting to know each other better, we got onto the topic of past partners and of course how many we had. I didn't lose my virginity until college and it was to a 5 year girlfriend I had. After that breakup, I slept with two other girls before Emily, bringing my number of sex partners to 4. Emily lost her virginity in high school and has had her share of boyfriends as well as hookups. She was at first hesitant about telling me her total, but eventually said it was over 20 guys (some of whom she is still in contact with). Not going to lie, I was taken aback by the number and was slightly put off, but didn't pay much mind to it at the time because I was really into her. Lately, it's all I can think about. Not solely based on her number, but how low my number is in comparison to hers. It leaves with me this sense of inferiority which, no matter how much I rationalize it, is overwhelming. It has turned into desires to sleep with other girls just so my number can be somewhat higher and closer to hers, and I feel terribly ashamed/guilty for even thinking this way. How do I learn to get over this meaningless issue and get back to enjoying our relationship together?Summary:
Summarize: I tell my friends at school this. I wear wool socks with sneakers, knit cap, cargo shorts and a few longsleeves and a hoodie until it gets below 25 Fahrenheit. I never understood layering up to walk from your dorm to class just to sweat in class in your long johns. At work I can be dressed like this for pretty extended periods in an unheated warehouse because I am moving furniture. I wouldn't want to sit in 20 degree temps for any amount of time but if I am moving I would much rather wear shorts. Also I have a huge ass and skinny hips so pants squeeze my balls. Shorts dont.Summary:
Summarize: If you don't have medical training, repeating something you read on the Internet or saw on a YouTube video as solid medical advice is not wise. Packing a wound with gauze and applying a pressure bandage along with a lot of direct pressure is how you treat a penetrating wound with non arterial bleeding. For arterial bleeding you apply a tourniquet atleast 2 inches above the wound, but probably up past the elbow or knee so you don't break bones puttin on adequate pressure, and then you pack the wound and apply a pressure bandage. You don't shove a fucking shitty cotton ball on a string into the wound. That's increadably poor advice. Tampons and pads also are not at all made for treating wounds and have lots of chemicals and fillers made to make nasty period blood smell less nasty that you really really don't need in a wound.Summary:
Summarize: I had read somewhere that putting trees in a hookah was a waste and would not work nearly as well as any other method. I tried it a while back and I agreed at the time... Yesterday after work I had this great idea to sit outside on my porch with my hookah and a book. I had taken a 2 week break and decided to sprinkle a little bit o kief (more than I should have I guess) in the middle of the hookah tobacco and mixed it all up, not really expecting much. After about 30 mins outside reading I felt the normal slow onset of the hookah light-headedness and then it hit me like a smack in the face. Perhaps it was the hot sun or the kief or the fact I mixed it so well into the tobacco and then life-lined myself to the hookah, but I felt myself, in a span of 5mins, go from [1] -> [8]. I stumbled getting out of my chair and struggled with the door and then walked inside and face planted on the couch where my roommate found me an hour later when he got home. Was the best nap I'd ever taken, and was still elevated for another two hours or so. Has anyone else experienced this? I was a little shocked... EDIT:Summary:

Summarize: Have a permanent scar on my dick from having too much sex. Not even joking. Here's how it went down. Had sex with my girlfriend. Afterwards, I realized the sides of my dick were kinda sore. This happens a few more times after sex and then I see the sides are a little pink. A few more sexytimes and all of a sudden, there is a tiny hole in my dickskin. After having sex, it starts to get more painful. But then we get horny again, have more sex. Did you know your pain tolerance goes up a lot during sex? The hole gets bigger. AFTER sex, I realize it is really painful. We decide to stop having sex to let it heal. But instead, we have more sex and it gets larger. We try using condoms to help or something. Nothing works. Eventually, it gets to the size of my pinky finger nail. I think eventually the pain overrode wanting to have sex because it healed, but that was a couple years ago so I don't remember. I think it was because she had shaved and had really sharp pubes? Not sure.Summary:
Summarize: Ik vraag me alleen af waar al het geld vandaan moet komen. Er is nu al niet genoeg geld, laat staan wanneer je het hele land een uitkering geeft. Het basisinkomen zou wel een hele rits aan subsidies in één klap kunnen vervangen, maar dan krijg je weer dat het halve land kwaad is omdat ze hun subsidie niet meer krijgen. En last but not least, als je dit invoert, moeten ook meteen de grenzen dicht. Voor iedereen. Zelfs voor andere Europeanen. Anders staat binnen twee jaar de halve wereld in de rij voor het gemeentehuis in Amsterdam, en daar is echt geen geld voor. En omdat mensen dan natuurlijk nog steeds binnenglippen, krijg je dan een onderklasse van illegale migranten die geen recht hebben op basisinkomen. Die je desondanks geen geld mag geven, omdat als je dat doet, morgen hun hele volk er staat.Summary:
Summarize: SJWs have been trying to get people to switch to another tag ever since GamerGate started to weakent he movement. Don't fall for that shit. They kept talking about how the only way GG could have credibility was switching the tag (like they would pretend another one would be any different). There were other retarded arguments for it, I just can't recall them.Summary:
Summarize: I have no desire to use or hear about the use of drugs like weed, coke, meth, etc. I personally want to be sober and present for as much of my life as possible. I plan to never touch said drugs. I do not want to hear about how much any of my friends or acquaintances use drugs, how high they were at any point, or what actions became of their choice to get high. Alcohol is a bit of a different case, seeing as I would actually like to be able to have a beer with someone. Alcohol is okay in my book so long as it is used responsibly and not just as means to get drunk. That means no "party drinking" that would lead to blacking out, but having a beer or two at a family gathering or one bottle with dinner on a Friday or a couple during a game is ok by me. I have no desire to drink to get drunk, and now that my friends are reaching legal drinking age I am making it clear to them that I will not be part of conversations involving how trashed they got last weekend or what became of their drunkenness.Summary:
Summarize: Wow... just wow... Thank you. You have captured almost entirely how I feel. I've also recently been diagnosed, as an adult, with ADHD-PI. I always had issues throughout school and now in university. I was quite capable of doing the work so generally speaking didn't have any problems. But when the work became harder and more involved.. things continually were left to the last minute. I couldn't bring myself to re-read things. Couldn't pay attention and just kept procrastinating. I always just put it down to me not being a good student. Being lazy. I'd have resolutions to 'turn a new leaf', and that would always fall apart. Then I stumbled across information on adult ADHD/ADD, found this subreddit and from then on it was just lightbulbs going off in my head. I read stories that just really fitted in with what I'd experienced, not just in schooling but also at work and at home or socialising. A lot of the textbook symptoms fit. Not being able to concentrate in training at work, not being able to focus on conversations with my partner or with other people, which I found less interesting... I too started to want it to be ADHD. Because suddenly there was an explanation for all these things that I'd just accepted as flaws about myself that I struggled to overcome. It felt like it actually made sense all of a sudden. But then I read other stories on here and some things don't fit. Like you, I'm not distracted by the thought of how a doorknob works, but I am constantly in my own mind and have issues paying attention to what people say. I have issues reading things, books, textbooks. I skim over things or just look at the words without reading them (I actually started replying to this before I fully read your post, had to stop and force myself two or three times to read it properly and entirely). After working out how to even approach getting help I finally was able to see a doctor who referred me to my psychiatrist. He started me on dexamphetamine (dexedrine, though it's unbranded here). Where I live in order to prescribe ongoing treatment with that sort medication the diagnosis must be backed up by another psychiatrist's diagnosis. So you essentially need two psychiatrists to diagnose you and agree. But even with two professional diagnoses, I still have this anxiety in me - constantly self-doubting and making me think the same thoughts you described. Maybe I should just be able to do better. Maybe I'm just exaggerating. Is the medication even helping? Maybe that shows I'm not ADHD I fully respect and have confidence in the professional abilities of both doctors, but the anxiety is there and I just feel like a fraud. I feel like I'm using ADHD as an excuse. I even sometimes getting thoughts like 'maybe you exaggerated things in the sessions to make it seem like you have ADHD', though I don't actually believe that to be true. It doesn't take much for the anxiety to appear: reading another person's experiences or description of ADHD that doesn't fit with mine; when medication isn't working as well as I expected it to, thinking about other people experiencing these issues or other non-ADHD people saying they have similar issues. It's frustrating and upsetting. This has turned into a bit of a long rant sorry. But seeing your post really clicked with me and I was just so excited that it isn't just me that feels like this. I think even that in itself makes me feel more confident. I don't really have any advice other than to suggest raising these feelings with your doctor. I intend to with mine at my next appointment. Looking back this has turned into a huge response despite constant editing and culling - apologies... no doubt if I was someone else reading this I probably wouldn't be able to.Summary:

Summarize: I know what you mean. The last thing I want to do while driving is listen to shitty music on the radio. I don't want to wade in amongst the adds, radio "personalities", and teeny-bopper bullshit that passes as mainstream music these days, praying that the next song that receives airtime, just before I arrive at my destination, is something that I'll like. The main complaints in this thread is how people don't like the music being played by JJJ at the moment and how it was better when they played music you liked. WELL GO FUCK YOURSELF. If there is a certain type of music you like listening to, then go buy/download the albums of your favourite band and stop crying about it. In this day and age when everyone seems to have a device that'll play an mp3, I have no idea why you would bother with the radio. Hate the presenters? Go download a podcast. Hate Aussie Hip Hop? Download the music you actually like. It's not rocket surgery; it's common-fucking-sense.Summary:

Summarize: Honestly this last patch has been the most poorly thought out set of balance changes i've seen in a very long time. after all of the talk of melee being notoriously weaker then ranged in this game (except in the cases of tanks) riot starts nerfing melee assassins who are already performing at an average level in solo queue, and FAR below average in competitive..? what? not only are melee assassins weak in competitive play and are regularly bypassed for ranged mages in the VAST majority of games, but they are also average in solo queue. lets take a look at champions "tweaked" this patch.. Fizz: a champion who's pretty much rarely/never played professionally that literally has ONLY one function (deals damage, no hard cc, no utility, not tanky) and has an average 51% ish win rate in solo queue, gets nerfed into being completely UNPLAYABLE. this is not an exaggeration. fizz is not playable right now. Akali: a champion who is NEVER played competitively and that literally has ONLY one function (deals damage, no hard cc, no utility, not tanky) gets her range nerfed and her bread and butter burst combo outright REMOVED from the game. Zed: arguably the STRONGEST and MOST POPULAR of all the melee assassins in the game (definitely the best competitively) and who was probably deserving of an actual nerf, ends up with the most meaningless nerf out of the 3... a minor attack speed nerf, resulting in slightly less turret killing power and slightly less dps in extended fights Ahri: a RANGED champion who is REGULARLY and CONSISTANTLY played in competitive, who has a solid above average solo queue winrate, and the most options in terms of playing in any style she chooses (passive/safe wave clearing, roaming, dueling, aggressive, poking, etc) gets MULTIPLE buffs. presumably under the guise of "compensation for the removal of DFG", an item which PLENTY of champions can effectively use, and yet only ahri gets a "compensation" buff for it, as if the champion wasn't functional without it. we've all seen people use DFG and make it work on tons of champs. ahri, leblanc, syndra, fizz, katarina, lissandra, etc. now, i want to make a very clear point on this entire concept of "counterplay" that riot has been obsessed with recently. this game is about DECISION MAKING and TEAM PLAY. if you get caught alone by a zed, a fizz, an akali, or another melee assassin, you SHOULD die. there shouldnt BE counterplay unless they make a mistake or your teammates save you. why? because if a melee assassin cant outduel people in 1v1s or do more damage then a ranged champion then there is literally NO advantage/reason to play a melee champion in this game unless you're a tank. ever. as an example to point out how ridiculous the recent "balance" changes are, how does it make sense for an ahri to be able to outduel a fizz and deal similar damage in a 1v1? she has similar damage, access to hard CC, better mana costs, better AND safer wave clear, better teamfighting, a ranged auto attack for csing and harassing, better sustain, ability to siege and NEVER has to risk melee range commitment. almost every ranged mage has these advantages Another point i want to bring up is that when people complain about assassins they have a bad habit of only thinking of games where the assassin gets fed and is running over their team. what if your teammates hadnt fed him? what if he was 0/0/0? would he still be one shotting you or 2v1ing you if you were ready for it? probably not. sure, if he catches you off guard 1v1 you'd still die or have to run, but thats the whole purpose of assassins.. 9/10 times the reason an assassin is snowballing is because you have a bad teammate who misplayed and fed him. thats how this game works. it has nothing to do with the champions involved. your teammate fed someone, so that person is stronger then he should be and he takes over the game, it happens all the time, not just with assassins. you just "feel" it more when you get caught by a fed assassin because you die quickly anyway, im getting pretty tired of all of these balance changes that have been happening under the guise of "counterplay", because the majority of them dont seem to have anything to do with counterplay. it just seems to be trying to appease bad solo queue players who never group in this TEAM game and constantly get caught out alone, then blame the champions involved instead of their bad decision to be alone at the 25 min mark. also, random side note, build paths for melee damage dealers SUCK. they are almost always less efficient then the typical morello/raba/void combo that ranged mages use, or the paths ADCs use. its annoying how streamlined tank/adc/mage build paths are, while melee carry build paths are sloppy and scatteredSummary:
Summarize: My boyfriend is 26, I'm 24F, been together for 3 years and living together for almost the same time. On to the heart of the matter: I think my boyfriend's mom is kind of clingy and intrusive, and when I try to speak to him about it, his response is pretty much "I know she's clingy and intrusive, but you're an asshole for not turning a blind eye like I do". He accuses me of not wanting them to have a relationship because I don't like her. I admit that I don't like her (she jumped to conclusions and called me a bitch, and when confronted about it she switched the story around to make it seem like she was talking about someone else and I misunderstood, and she plays the victim now) but that's neither here nor there. I don't mind if she visits her son at our home, I don't mind them hanging out together. I'm always courteous to her. My issues are: Her dropping her in at 11 p.m. and beyond, dropping in without calling first, and wanting to party with us and our friends. Whenever she intrudes, she makes sure to bring along food or a gift for my boyfriend so that way I'm doubly an asshole for complaining about her just wanting to do something nice for her "baby boy" (by the way, my boyfriend has a younger brother that she NEVER refers to as anything other than his name). My boyfriend doesn't like the partying thing either, but he's too chicken to say anything. All he ever does is farm excuse after excuse to avoid talking to her about ANYTHING. He says he has talked to her about it and she won't change, but he never enforces anything. She keeps doing it because she knows he won't ever hold her to anything. He hardly ever acknowledges my complaints without a "but" attached, in which he shifts all blame on to me and paints me as a cruel jealous bitch that wants him to curse out his mom. I don't expect him to be mean or disrespectful to his mom or cut her out of his life, and I don't understand why he can't/won't talk to her adult to adult. She and my bf used to have a very strained relationship, which they've managed to reverse in the last year and a half or so. I really am happy for them, but I feel like they are both going overboard now. As I said before, my bf has a brother that she leaves completely alone. It's clear my bf is her favorite, and I know he secretly relishes this, as his brother was heavily favored by the rest of the family when he was younger. But I feel like they've gone from one unhealthy extreme to the other. I am going to try one last time to talk to him about this. What do you think, r/relationships? Am I really just not understanding enough? Any suggestions for how I should go about talking to him?Summary:
Summarize: So this happened nearly seven months ago now, I'm starting to see my life in a kind of BC/AD way with regards to this event. So I went interrailing with a couple of friends of mine last summer. For the unaware, "interrailing" is a wonderful system that Europeans such as myself (UK) have enjoyed for half a century now. Essentially you dish out a large amount of cash for a ticket that allows you to board any train in the EU for a month. My mother did it in the seventies and now it was my turn. Many teenage kicks ensued. Towards the end of the trip we found ourselves in Rome, at almost 4am wandering the streets drunkenly realising that we probably weren't going to find any clubs open at this time. So we opted in stead for a peregrination to an establishment bearing the crest of "McDonalds". And it was during this quest for grotesquely processed produce that my lovely fuck-up occurred. Yes, I was very drunk. Not the most drunk I had been that trip, not by far, but certainly very inebriated. Fuelled by near a full month of adolescent romps my ego was concerned that I prove that I was most certainly, a wild one. Yes, I was one of the cool kids. Look, I just climbed to the top of this ladder! Look, I just climbed to the top of this wall! Ah, how do I get down again? The voice of my friend, next to me, who also scaled the fence like a horny squirrel, is now anxiously encouraging me to jump down, quick. I look down. Pavement. Well, I'll have to get over my fear of heights some time, why not now? This is going to hurt, isn't it? Yes. S is convinced I'm just being a massive puss again but calls an ambulance for me just to make sure. C later revealed he, too, thought I was overreacting when he heard the first scream, but then I kept screaming. And screaming. I stopped screaming, they went to get McDonalds. I'm alone. I feel like I'm dying. It hurts like hell, but even more I'm the thirstiest I've ever been. I'm so thirsty. Everything starts spinning. I can't breath. I'm dying, oh shit. I remember some breathing excercises. I practice them. Sanity reasserts itself. The friends return, and soon an ambulance arrives. C forgot to pick up my fuckin water. I didn't care much at the time. I kept thinking how nice all the staff were in spite of being clearly exhausted. Agua, por favore. Grazie. Broken calcaneus. Lover's fracture. I fucked up my heel bone. The rest of my summer was pretty boring after I got home a few days later. It took so fucking long to walk again. All the muscles in my right leg wasted while I was in the cast, they're still not back yet, quite. Life is good, university is cool, if a bit lonely. But the doctor said I might never feel normal again. Walking. I should avoid "high impact training". Like what? Running? Fucking running? I run everywhere. I used to. In secondary school I was that weird kid who runs everywhere. It's a part of me in a big way, I've always done it. I still can't run now, in mid-february. I've mostly got my physical confidence back, I even went to Poland and learnt how to snowboard last week (I know, I'm fucking lucky), but I can't run and I still limp. My life is fucking awesome, objectively, but a piece is missing. It sucks. I don't mind getting arthritis when I'm old so much, but I want to be able to be young. I didn't feel regretful at the time, jumping off that wall felt like an inevitability, but I thought my young body would bounce back in a couple of months. I didn't even consider it could be permanent. I still think I will be able to run again, but I hope you can agree this is fucking annoying. HELLO ALL YOUNG PEOPLE. You are not indestructible. Not only can you die, but your body is actually very fragile. You're probably imagining I jumped off some giant wall. Nope. Dude, it was about eight feet. I really didn't think that height could permanently fuck you up, but yeah, it can. Be careful out there, have fun, be rad and break the rules but don't ever think you have something to prove by jumping off shit. Don't drink and climb. Uhh yeah, love u reddit xxxSummary:
Summarize: Ok so this didn't happen today but happened a few years ago! At the time of the the fuck up I was about 13 or 14 years old! This happened durning the school holidays. And I was stuck at home while my parents were at work. On that day my gran was at the house with me and as with most 13 year olds I got bored of being stuck in the house and decided to go outside and find something to occupy my tiny mind. Being a boy at that age I loved playing with fire and setting things on fire. So I had a magnifying glass and was burning holes into leaves and setting small pieces of paper alight. That soon become unsatisfactory to the arsonist inside me and wanted bigger flames. This is where things start becoming a fuck up. So I sit for a while and think how can I get bigger fires going and then a little light bulb went on. Why not take an aerosol tin of deodorant and a lighter and make a flames by spraying the aerosol onto the open flame. I run inside get my deodorant and take a lighter from the kitchen all while my gran was sleeping in the chair. I go outside and do a few bursts of flames and with the can of spray and lighter and thought it was great. Once again I got bored of it and wanted to up the excitement some more. I wonder around the garden and see and old tree, this tree was semi dead at the time and it was a sort of palm tree. So this tree was standing about 1,5m from the house so it was pretty close and was just taller than the house, if I had to guess the height I'd say about 3,5m or more. The thing about this tree is that it had weird little wooden stick things that stuck out of it. And I thought hmm that will be fun to burn. I proceed to douse one of the little wooden spikes with the deodorant, what I didn't realize about the tree was that it had like this fine "hair" ( like the hair you find on the outside of a coconut) around the trunk that ran all the way up the tree and in the process of covering the stick with the deodorant I got some on this highly flammable hair. Here's where the story heats up ( pun intended ) I set the little stick on fire and of course the flame carries to this hair around the tree and next thing I knew the fire was all the way at the top of the tree. It had climbed the tree so quickly I didn't realize what happened until I saw the smoke. Immediately a wave of panic hits me, what if the fire spreads to the house cause we have wooden fascia boards and if that catches on fire the house will be toast. Luckily the tree was still alive at the top and went leaves weren't really catching on fire but the truck was burning up quickly. So I run around the corner to fetch the hose pipe as I run around the corner with it I realize it's not going to be long enough to reach the tree and I drop it and think of another way. I run into the house with the tree still burning and get out one of my moms big Tupperware bowls and run back to the tree, all while my gran is still fast asleep. By this point the smoke is now rising quickly so I run to the pool and fill the bucket with water run back to the tree and threw the water at the flames, I repeated this action about 3 or 4 times until the fire was out. Once the fire was out I took damage control, I looked around and the house was fine but the tree was black around the back and if it wasn't dead then it would be now. Thinking I got away with this without any serious trouble I went back into the house and watched some tv. Later that evening my dad came home and I was in my room when I heard him at the front door talking to the next door neighbour. Few minutes later he came into my room to question me. Apparently the next door neighbour saw the smoke in the back yard and asked my dad if everything was fine. I came clean to the crime and showed my dad the tree. I got grounded for a month and the next day and for the rest of the week I had to go to work with my dad. Keep in mind that my dad works at a bank. If I was bored before, I was definitely bored then! The tree was removed a few years later removed because I ended up killing it!Summary:
Summarize: When I get too nervous, or distracted, or focused... or a lot of things... I start to walk clumsily. I don't know WHY! I'm actually extremely athletic, typically coordinated, intelligent, and can chew gum while patting my head and rubbing my tummy... but the simple act of walking at a normal pace... for some reason, it's not always something I can pull off correctly. It becomes even more of a problem when, for one reason or another, I start to think about it. Once I'm aware I'm walking oddly, the fact I'm TRYING to walk normally only makes it get so much worse. I don't trip and fall or bump into people or anything like that, I get from point A to point B fine, I just look weird while doing it. Jerky and without rhythm, slightly different stride lengths almost every step. Ever hear of the Uncanny Valley? Robots that look close to human are more appealing, unless they are TOO similar, in which case they seem creepy. I think I might be the only human who exists in the uncanny valley. Anywhoozle... There have been several instances like this, but this one stands out the most. Some guy walking several yards behind me starts laughing and says to his friends, "He walks like a robot!" They all start laughing. I'm dead sure they're talking about me. I turn my head to look back, sure enough they are staring at me with wide-eyed smiles painted across their faces, exceedingly delighted at the curiosity they've discovered. One is even pointing, as though their feeble intellects might cause them to forget what they're laughing about if they don't keep crosshairs on me. Somehow, I don't lose my cool, I don't panic... but now, I've thought about it, I know I'm being watched, and I can't help but try to walk normally... so it starts to get worse, on the very next step I kind of jerk forward a bit. If they thought I looked funny before, they're in for a treat. "Beep! Boop bop! Beep beep beeEEeep!" The laughing starts to build, rather than settle down. Am I really going to just ignore them? Tgey arent even trying to go unnoticed, they're practically begging me to either confront them or join in on the laughs. It's only been ten seconds tops, I can still react without seeming awkward for waiting so long, but what the hell do I say? I turn my head to look back again, and the guy who labeled me a robot makes eye contact as he blurts out his loudest "BEEEEP!" Seeing as this has been the bane of my existence for many years, I know a BIT about it. I know that it's only obvious when someone watches me from behind or the side, from at least ten or so feet away, but from up close or straight ahead I look somewhat normal. But what about walking backward?? Do I look less odd from ahead when walking backward? What do I have to lose? The sidewalk ahead is clear for at least 50 feet, and it's one of the wide sidewalks like in downtown areas. I turn to face them, mid-stride, rather deftly I might add. "I really am a robot." I stare at them coldly. I'm actually pretty proud of myself in this instant, because I'm nailing the backward walking pretty well, at least as fluidly as the average person would. Remember, I'm athletic and for the most part well-coordinated. I just look weird when I walk for some reason. "Why are you walking backward?" "I don't have time to stop and chat, and I don't like talking over my shoulder." "Well, you walk like a retard buddy." One of his friends, a relatively attractive female, smacks his arm lightly and mutters "Don't be mean." He rolls his eyes and adds another, "Beep beep!" for good measure. I sigh and begin to turn back around, glad to at least be nearing my destination and the laughing has subsided. Tgat's when she said it. "Sorry Robot Boy! I tried!" She proceeds to break into laughter, as does everyone else, and they continue to laugh until I enter the book store. That's the part that stuck with me. Not the guy who called me a robot. The girl who pretended to defend me to avoid feeling/looking so guilty. Why bother? You clearly didn't actually care about my feelings, or cared so little that the potential laughs took priority. Does pretending to care matter? Who was it for, me or you? Or maybe you only feigned uninvolvement until you came up with a way to meaningfully participate. I'm not actually sure. All I know is that for a moment, I felt ever so slightly like I had an ally, or at least something less than an enemy... and then you ripped that away from me while laughing. It left more of an impression. Congratulations. EDIT: Never mind, I forgot. I figured this all out a few years ago. I have a gigantic penis which swings around in my pants causing me to walk funny. I have since then quit going commando and the issue went away. Now that I'm of age to take advantage, my large penis brings me so much joy that I don't even think I'd mind walking funny. I'm very happy and worry free. Sorry lady, Robot Boy is no more. Though, to be honest, I still wouldn't mind if you developed a karma limp.Summary:
Summarize: Used my vibrator for the first time by myself! Usually any and all girlplay happens during foreplay with my SO, and normally at his house. Over the past years, masturbation just hasn't done anything for me, because I get too stuck in my own head and start thinking too much about my day or about the possibility of the other people living in my house hearing anything. I far prefer someone else to be playing with me, partly because I know I'm being loved, and partly because when someone else is in control, I don't necessarily know what they're going to do and it can surprise me rather than be boring and predictive. My SO has been really sweet and patient with me when it comes to going outside my comfort zone with sex or masturbation, but he kept urging me to use my vibrator at home and just discover what clicked for me, on my own time (still haven't orgasmed, and not because he isn't fantastic, because trust me, he is). So I picked up my lady balls and just did it. Fan-fricken-tastic! Didn't orgasm, but got really really close about 3 times, which is a record for me because if I start feeling good and stop, I sometimes go a bit numb and can't get that warm-building feeling up again. I'm also adding that I've never posted on Sexual Achievement Sunday, so I'm counting this as two personal achievements!Summary:
Summarize: you're speaking my language. i was discussing with my room mate tonight that, despite the success of andy reid throughout his tenure with the eagles, it may be time for him to go. he asked me if i could really measure what we've done as 'success' under him or if it was mostly due to donovan and the rest of the great players we've had over the years and i honestly don't know any more. the breaking point for me is hearing fucking redskins fans compare this underwhelming, disappointing team to the shitshow they have going on right now. in all honesty, with better playcalling and coaching, we could easily have been a top tier team if not the most obvious contender for a superbowl this year. instead, we're this.Summary:
Summarize: Generally, splitting is done differently in California than elsewhere. In other parts of the world, motorcycles are expected to filter through to the front of traffic for red lights. In California, to my understanding, lane-splitting is mostly done in heavy, but still moving traffic. As far as the statistics go, I'd have to find that study they mentioned, but how often do you hear about a motorcycle sandwiched between the sides of two vehicles as opposed to how often you hear about bikes getting crunched back to front? Though a bit counter-intuitive, in heavy traffic conditions it's safer to be lane-splitting (not always, there is no always in motorcycles) because cars tend to stay in their lanes. In heavy traffic, the most common type of collision is when someone gets rear-ended. Stop-and-go traffic is the worst for this. If you were caught between those cars, you're not in good shape, but if you were lane splitting, you're out of harms way.Summary:
Summarize: Just like an employee who goes from part time, to full time, to management until they reach their point of incompetency, relationships go from short term, to long term, to marriage(or whatever actually goes here) until they reach their point of failure. They are often promoted based off of how good they are in current phase not how well suited they are for the next one. They then stay at this point indefinitely or until they get fired(or relationship is ended).Summary:

(I'm a bit more than the average myself, as you already know) Of course i got my preferences as everybody. What am i expecting from my sub? You will serve me, please me - via text, pictures or (if you're okay with it) via Webcam. We'll start of slowly, to get to know each other and see where it leads us from then. I'd like to get reports about what you've done, what you plan on doing, how you feel. It's a good way for us both to exchange thoughts, find out what bothers us or what we like. You will get tasks, rules and orders to follow during the day. Some will be "instant" some will be during the day - so it won't interfere too much with your regular life. We'll discuss this while we get to know each other, i don't want to rush into this and after a few days one of us or we both realize that it's not working out. Depending on your success or failure, you will be rewarded or punished. Of course i'm aware that you got a personal life that needs to be taken care of. Expect these rules to be strict, we can discuss these when the time is right, what rules we'll set up for you is depending on your kinks, likes and dislikes. What will you gain in exchange? You will gain somebody that listens, that cares about you. Someone you can talk with on a personal level aside being "the sub". We will also communicate on that personal level, so we know about each other, helping us both get a "feel" for each other. You will also get pictures and Stories out of my daily life. I believe that it shall be fun for both, both giving and recieving. Other stuff you should know about: We will start talking with each other, see if we click. After we've done that, i will declare my rules and we will answer open questions. After that done, you will be given an order - where you submit yourself to me. We'll make clear what parts of your life i'm gaining control over, what your limits are and what you want to explore during your sub service for me. Our communication will be via KiK or Skype or various other IM Services - we'll talk about this. Some of my Kinks For this to work out well for the both of us we need to have the same taste in kinks.

Summarize: Yasuo isn't a cancer champ. He is already laughably weak in lane, and doesn't have anywhere near the amount of power that he used to have mid game. On top of this his transition to mid game is even shittier because his Q no longer has a reduced cd per level. This just makes his laning phase literally the worst in the game if the enemy laner has more than two brain cells to rub together.Summary:
Summarize: Oh my lord. I met a guy online once when my boyfriend and I had broken up for a month or so. We messaged for a while first, then texted...this elevated into phone and Skype calls. He looked attractive, had a sexy irish accent, we got along swimmingly. We made plans for him to spend the weekend in my town three hours away (on his own) to enjoy a night out and the following day together. The instant we met there was a disconnect, but I went through with it. We left his truck at the meeting spot, and rode into the city. He kept trying to put his arm around me or hold my hand, which I would politely evade. Got dinner, during which he wanted to play 20 questions through the entire meal...red flag. Leave the restaurant, to take a romantic stroll through downtown...I am way uncomfortable and play the 'I'm not ready card' (which I really wasn't...) during which he consoles me and I try to talk more about what happened with my boyfriend and why I couldn't possibly start again yet. He then proceeds to show me his WEDDING RING, which he is STILL WEARING from a last minute canceled marriage like two years prior. We get to my car, I start the waterworks, he PETS ME, PICKS ME UP AND CARRIES ME AROUND DANCING IN THE STREET, AND KISSES ME. I am WAY ready to drop off this weirdo and go home, so eventually after about 20 minutes of telling him it isn't going to work, he gets weird. Goes emotional: "Well, you know if we are just friends our conversations have to change, right?" holding my hands in his hands I just, eyes downcast, "Yes." He, squeezing my hands, "Look me in the eyes and tell me that you really understand that." I bristle, snap my head up, and dead in his face: "YES." He gets passively-aggressive, clipped, short, dramatic. I'm freaking out inside. I try to get him into my car and he resists, finally opens my door for me and then proceeds to THROW himself into my passenger's seat, leaning forward and cradling his head in his hands for the majority of the ride back. I literally have my knife at my left thigh, afraid this psycho is going to jerk the wheel and kill us both. We make it back to his truck, and he won't get the fuck out of my car. I finally get him out, and go to hand him his sunglasses that he was sitting on. Him: "No, you keep them." Like a fucking MOMENTO. Tell him to drive safe, slam that bitch in reverse and GTFO of there. Dropped off after a few days later I asked how his day was when he texted me, and he goes "I'd tell you but I don't want you to worry." Nope. I'm good. Nope. Bye.Summary:
Summarize: Have you done in-depth research about doing a local high school? It seems preposterous that it would take you 3 additional years to finish high school when you have (I assume) already completed 3 years. There might be some small requirement differences, but I would be shocked if it took more than 1 year over your normal grad date to complete the requirements. I know this part won't be easy to hear, but you're not depressed because you're apart from your BF. You might be sad. He might be sad. Neither of you are depressed. You are young people in "love" and you will be sad while you are apart. Nothing will change that, but there is nothing wrong with you in a clinical psychological sense because of this. If you feel the need to write bad poetry, do so (just please don't submit it here). But you will be fine after a few years cool off your teenage genitals.Summary:
Summarize: A little background story: We were very close friends before we got together. I didn't really like him in that way, but I decided to give us a chance. After a few months, we consummated our relationship. We had a lot of passion during the first few months, and we fell out of the honeymoon phase really quickly. We never really "dated" but just hung around and went out with friends. It's been 4 years and we really care about each other, we really love each other, and we really want to get married in the future. But to be honest, I am really bored. We're both 20 years old and I feel as if we're at that age where we're not old enough to have "adult" fun, but we're too old to have "teenage" fun. And we feel as if we're too young to go on "sophisticated" dinner dates. We both don't make a lot of money, (as a matter of fact, he lost his job almost a year ago severely limiting his ability to act as a boyfriend, which put a lot of stress on me because I felt like I had to be both the boyfriend and girlfriend, if that makes sense), so we can't do anything expensive. And since we're tight with money, I'm very frugal with my gas which makes it harder to go out. We hang out almost every day, and all we really do is eat, sleep, and watch TV. It's hard for us to try to find things we like to do together. He's always asking if I want to try some of his hobbies, like TF2 and League, but I'm just not interested; and I have no hobbies that I could ask him to join into. Most importantly, my sex drive has been really low lately so we don't have sex very often. Because of all this, I feel as if we're no longer a couple. It feels to me that we're just friends that have invested a lot of time into each other and have occasional sex. Is there anything that we can do to spice up our relationship again? Any guides to frugal dating? Is there any way I can try to get my sex drive back to where it was in the beginning? (I'm on birth control pills which can be the cause considering it has a possible side effect of "low sex drive"). Or are there any suggestions to keeping us entertained at home? Here's another thing, which may be an entirely different problem, or it may be related. He was my first and he's been my only. So other than I love him, the fact that we've had sex makes it hard for me to leave him. Sometimes I feel very lucky to have found someone so early in life. But at the same time, is it too soon to settle? A part of me wants to experience actual dating; but the part of me that holds onto the fact he's been my only partner makes it really hard to even consider it. And being bored is making it even more difficult. So I guess my final question is: Reddit, should I salvage our relationship and how? Or should I realize it's time to move on?Summary:

Summarize: Being depressed is a really awful thing. You shut down and stop being so outgoing. If you're already an introvert people don't notice what has happened because its a series of really small changes to your lifestyle. But that's the key. No one notices. And that nasty little voice starts echoing in the back of your mind and you recognize it. But by now you're trapped. you've forgotten how to live without depression and you begin sabotaging your own attempts to beat it. Your failures are the only thing that echo in your mind. "You're worthless" you tell yourself, "You can't succeed at anything." Your hobbies and passions lose their luster and stop being enjoyable. You're filled with despair and crippling sense of loss and defeat with no way out.Summary:
Summarize: I came to terms just how toxic my mother was this past year. I've all but removed her from my life but I won't cut the ties completely for the sake of my siblings and keeping thing cordial for their life events; I'm honestly not sure I want her there for my life events and it hurts to type that but the truth is that she is very much a trigger for me and I don't want anymore lies or forced smiles headed my way. I'm going to work my way backwards a bit a hit the major displays of negative behavior or what I perceive as negative in my personal experience. This does not include what my siblings have gone through because that gets....really personal and it's not my place to say but they certainly cement this view in my mind about her. My college graduation. My mother, father, stepmother, sister, brother, boyfriend, aunt, and 2 of my high school friends all travel to my location for the occasion. My mother's friend decides to invite herself along and my mother turns it around on me when I ask her why this friend is coming that, "Oh YOU invited her with your Facebook event page" - what I did was place an event up on Facebook and invite all my FB friends to the page to say thank you and share the event pictures, I did not invite everyone to actually come as those people received card invitations. Not only does this friend come but my mother leaves with her in the middle of photo taking to go buy shoes....yeah. Now she's angry with me because we don't have many photos together after the ceremony because she left. She also makes the celebration dinner very awkward by bringing a TON of gas station gifts to the table and more gifts back at my place because my father bought me a small bouquet of flowers. Oh, she also leaves to go to Florida with the self-inviting friend and go fishing.. on a trip where she said it would be about us... She went insane and started berating me and cursing me out on Facebook when a group conversation turned into her bashing my father to her sister. I asked her to move it to a private location and she made a snippy comment about my father and I asked her again to do it and mind that he never spoke about her this way in front of us so she should show the same courtesy. It turned into a month long verbal war and she still hasn't apologized. She NEVER apologizes for anything and always takes the victim stance. She once tried to use the "your father cheated on me" card to which I responded that I knew of 2 instances where she did cheat on my dad but I've never seen him show these behaviors. I didn't discredit the accusation I was merely saying that she needed to stop displaying it in front of me and my younger sibling, I'm now the daughter that calls her a whore and her boyfriend chastised me. My mother lives overseas and I don't get over there often (or at all) because of the fare costs. I did go over once, it put me in the red financially and my apartment lease in jeopardy because instead of giving me the money to help with that like she said she would, she spent it on Christmas gifts. This was after I stated that we WON'T be exchanging gifts, the trip is the gift and I just want time with her. I left her house when I was 18, at 26 I still haven't received any of my belongings and she left my cat behind when she moved away..right before I got the money to fly him over and AFTER I got her another cat to keep her company. She still has the cat I got her. High school graduation. I found out my parents were getting a divorce; she had been dating a man for an entire year beforehand (I had no idea how to handle the situation...none) and my father found out they were getting a divorce the same day I did. Throughout my senior year I lived at my friend's house because she was never home and the only way I was getting fed or any social interaction was by the kindness of my friend's mother. This mother is also married to the man my mother tempted to run away with. Nearly destroyed the greatest friendship I had and nearly ruined two families. My mother admitted to me that if she could do it all over again she would never have had children, she would have gone to music school. She took all the cash I had saved up for prom and spent it. It took several arguments to get anything back to pay for the dress, my hair and makeup had to be done by myself (which I had 0 idea on how to do) because she forgot to make the salon appointment. She also left before seeing me and my date off so she could be with her boyfriend. I had to set the camera up on a table with a timer to get a photo. My mother promises that my father will move overseas with us as soon as he finds a job there. He does and she tells him not to come (this was before I found out about the boyfriend) because I'll be graduating soon and need someone in the states to help me for college. My mother sent my away on the weekend's to my friend's house with a bundle of cash. We hardly spent a weekend together. My mother kept taking me out of school and I thought it was great at the time because I had anxiety and depression issues, I came to realize it was to keep her company when she should have helped me overcome it. My mother sat me down and told me she and my Dad were getting divorced when he came back from deployment because it wasn't working out. He came back and the subject was never brought up again. My mother would tell embarrassing stories about me at her workplace that reached my school and she wouldn't stop after several pleas because it helped her career though it killed my social life. She'd forget about picking me up on several occasions so I'd be left waiting until dinner time when the family realized I wasn't at the table. I couldn't call my Dad because his work wouldn't allow personal calls. I felt the need to post this because it's still very much a sore point in my life and she's such a trigger. It's so frustrating because my siblings still maintain a relationship with her so I have to hear about what she did now and I don't want my relationship with them to be fueled by her. It's also so hard because recently she came to me saying that I was "distancing myself from the family" and I explained that I'm not, that I speak almost daily with my one sibling and at least once a week with the other (who has a crazy work schedule). She said that it feels like she's been distanced and I explained that she's doing that to herself by being the only member overseas where it's difficult to visit, expensive to call and she never gets online to chat or if she does she'll spend 2 minutes there then rush off when the conversation gets off of her passion (she ONLY talks about theater and no one else has any relation or interest in it). She won't accept that she's doing it to herself so once again I'm the horrible daughter doing it. I'm done. My relationship with my brother, sister and father are stronger than ever. I spent so much of my childhood trying to keep us altogether, I clung SO TIGHTLY to everyone because I was so alone and they ignored me. Now we've finally come back together and it's not the traditional family structure but it's perfect for us and she tries to destroy it. She's a trigger for me, my brother and my sister and I will be DAMNED if she ruins any of their life events.Summary:
Summarize: There was a house fire in a town near me and they were doing a television appeal for the family involved. They did the interview outside the front of the house (the house only partially burned, the garage segment to the side was mostly untouched). This family is looking all cut and then the reporter/interviewer asks "Is there anything that you would really like someone to donate, something that would make your day?". This woman responds "We'd love some bikes for the kids. The three of them have lost everything and bikes would just be something to play with, something for them to own again". Fair enough right? Except for the fact the people hauling goods out of the unburned garage were taking the untouched perfectly fine bikes outside ON CAMERA! I counted 3 bikes leaving that garage and all of them didn't have a scratch. She obviously thought bikes would have good resale value or something.Summary:
Summarize: I have read the last 3 or 4 “creepy threads” and I have always been hesitant to contribute, mostly out of pure laziness, but more so I am really not the “contributing” type. I also know how ridiculous my story really sounds. Unfortunately this did actually happen to me. I don’t post, so I won’t post after this unless it’s to answer questions, most likely. (assuming this doesn’t get entirely buried). I’m mostly doing this because I realized I have never actually written this down and it might be nice to finally do that. Now for my story. Background details: I live in a semi rural area, in a very small neighborhood on waterfront property. The house I live in is surrounded by water on all sides. I have a large yard, to my front and back there are river banks, and to the right there are piers and water access. The two other houses to the right of mine (near the piers) are unoccupied for most of the year, and also at the time of my incident. I live with my boyfriend. His parents own this house, but they live elsewhere, about an hour away. Approximately 3 years ago, I was 20, home alone and in bed. My boyfriend had been away, helping his parents fix their internet (yes and this shit continues to happen all the time and there never ends up being an actual problem with it btw) and he was going to have dinner with them afterwards. I wasn’t expecting him home until the next morning because he had a late start and his mother has a habit of talking him into staying the night. I am a light sleeper, and I awoke to what sounded like a boat engine. Not really that unusual, there’s a lot of boat activity where I am, and my bedroom faces that part of the water, so I can usually hear everything that goes on out there. I checked my phone and it was roughly 1:30. At that point, I did think someone was just a weird asshole out there at that time of night, but I eventually stopped caring and fell back asleep. I remember waking up to the sound of footsteps on our ground floor. There are hardwood floors, so I can hear the entire route someone travels from one side of the house to the other. I assumed my boyfriend had decided to come home after all, and I listened to him move around the house, waiting for him to come upstairs. I had almost drifted back to sleep when I heard footsteps on the stairs. My room is the first room, directly at the top of the stairs, and I leave the hallway light on, most nights. I heard him open our bedroom door, and I didn’t turn over right away. Our bed faces the door, and I was turned on my right side, facing away. I didn’t even open my eyes for a while, I was groggy and I had no idea what he was doing. Finally I realized he still hadn’t come in, because I could see the light through my eyelids and I finally rolled over to ask him what the hell he was doing. There was a man in my doorway, a man that I immediately realized was not my boyfriend. I noticed his hair immediately. He had really long, scraggly hair, and he was much shorter than my boyfriend. I couldn’t see many details of his face at that point, mostly the silhouette from the hallway light. I panicked. I immediately thought I was going to die and I had to get out of there. I screamed, started crying, the whole deal. I have a remote lightswitch, which I am not sure hurt or helped me really, because I then had to see this disgusting man. He looked dirty, and I mean like, actually covered in dirt. Flannel shirt, puffy vest thing over the top, and his eyes were bulging out of his head. That’s the one thing I will never forget. Those bulging. Fucking. Eyes. I looked at him and then realized why he had been standing there for so long. I was naked. I sleep that way, I imagine most people do. If you don’t, you should, but maybe not after reading this. I had panties on, but I was topless. At the time it was warm and I had no comforter on my bed, only a sheet and I didn’t even have the time to think to cover myself when I notice my potential murderer standing in my doorway. The kicker? When I turned the light on, he continued to stare at me…licking his lips. Literally, smacking his lips. It was obvious at this point what his intentions were originally (to rob the place), and what they had just now become when he saw me(to rape me). I jumped up as fast as I could and backed myself up against the farthest wall. I asked him what he wanted. He grunted. That was all I could get out of him, grunts. I had two weapons at my disposal. 1.) 2 20 lb weights. 2.) An electric guitar. I chose the guitar for it’s swinging power and held it up like a baseball bat. I’m sure I looked really awesome at this point. I begged him to just leave, to take what he wanted and to just leave. He didn’t move for a really long time. It felt like forever. He just stared at me as I cried and begged. Finally, he let out the most disturbing thing I will probably ever hear, “Put down the gee-tar, sweetheart.” I had just about lost it, I honestly thought I was going to faint, vomit, die, something. I knew deep down that I couldn’t move if I even wanted to. What happened next is probably the most unbelievable part of this story, but it’s honestly the only way I was able to eventually make light of the situation, and to tell the story the way I am now able to. Right after he told me to put down the “gee-tar”, he farted. Shit you not, a long, loud and otherwise impressive fart. I remember he kind of looked uncomfortable at what he had just done, but he then decided to take a step forward. All my adrenaline rushed at once and I saw him coming at me and all I could think to do was run. He realized I was going to bolt and he lunged for me and as he did, I lept up onto my bed and dashed over the other side and right out my bedroom door. It was almost too fucking easy. I don’t remember how I got down the stairs, but I got down them quickly enough. It was all a blur after that. The front door had a deadbolt but the door to our garage does not, and I realized that’s how he got in. I’m sure I didn’t leave it unlocked but I do occasionally do the things that stupid girls do. The garage door was still open a crack and that’s where I made my exit. I could hear him fumbling down the stairs but I don’t think he chased me through the rest of the house after that. I got out the garage door and had to run across a bunch of gravel and cut through to my nearest neighbors home. Not only did I nearly get raped by an intruder, but I also had the wonderful experience of banging on my 75 year old neighbor’s door, half-naked. I got in, he called the police, and while we were waiting for them, I heard a boat engine start up and leave. That’s right. A man came and escaped by boat to rob our house. I don’t think he expected me to be there, as there were no cars in our driveway and no lights on, and a lot of people know that several houses in our area are sort of “vacation homes”. The police came and didn’t really do much. I gave them my statement, and I left out the fart, which I honestly now regret but I was not in an amusing mood at the time. They scanned every room in the house but he was obviously long gone, out in the bay, having a laugh probably. They never found him. He didn’t actually get much from our house. He took the cash I had left on the counter, the toolbox from our garage, and oddly I think he stole my passport. I never found my passport after that day, and it had been left on the counter as well. Kind of weird to think about. Truth be told, this whole thing did really screw me up for quite sometime. Needless to say, all of our doors have deadbolts now, and my boyfriend has to come home every single night. I was ultra paranoid about every noise, every boat, every night in alone for at the entire year after that. Now I realize, hell, I got out of it. I’m okay. We have deadbolts now, I’ll probably be fine. In the end, some of what happened was really funny, and I do laugh when I look back on it most of the time. Sometimes I cry, it just depends on the situation. I wasn’t raised to be afraid of anything, (which is highly unnatural) and I realize this all sounds ridiculous, and it absolutely was. Shit was bananas.Summary:
Summarize: First of all, let me say I hope I'm doing this right! I'm probably the oldest person here, but my daughter is a "Redditor" and suggested I get what's on my chest off and maybe hear some different perspectives - so here goes! My ex-husband and I divorced almost four years ago. I've dated a little since then, but nothing too serious. About six or seven months ago I reconnected with an old neighbor (and when I say "old" I mean we were in Jr. High when we lived next to one another!). "Shawn" walked up to me at the airport to re-introduce himself after he heard me paged and recognized the name, we clicked really well, he offered to split a cab home with me and we've been dating ever since. We have quite a lot in common: we both own our own businesses, we are both very into theatre (he acts and so does my son and daughter), our kids are right in the same age range (mid-twenties), and we both love to travel and dine out. My son is gay and (while this had made other men I've dated uncomfortable) Shawn isn't concerned at all. So the issue I'm having is this: Shawn has several women friends, one in particular whom he texts and calls on a frequent basis. We'll call her "Amber." They met through the theatre and dated for a very brief period of time. Shawn doesn't hide that he's still friends with her or that they were together, and when I asked why they broke up he honestly explained they were just at different points in their lives and careers and were incompatible. He says she wasn't "looking for anything serious" with him. I've seen her texts and been in the same room when he's talked to her on the phone - nothing flirtatious really, in fact they mostly discuss theatre and books and business. So no big deal, right? I didn't think so until I was introduced to Amber the other day. Though I had never asked what she looks like or how old she is, I had a picture in my mind that resembled, well, someone a lot more like me in size, shape, and age. Nope. She's barely 30 and looks like she fell off the cover of a magazine! The waitress asked her for ID when she ordered a glass of wine for goodness sakes! I'll admit that while I didn't feel threatened I did feel a little pang of jealousy. That's normal I think and I'm not concerned. What I really couldn't get over though was the fact that Shawn dated someone who's our kids' ages! There's something about it that just makes me feel strange and uncomfortable. She's a very bright girl and mature and accomplished for her age, but I can't shake the case of "heebie jeebies" I got seeing them together. His nickname for her is "BK," and that's also how she appears in his phone. I finally asked what it stood for after we all met and he said, "baby kitten." I know they're both adults but that just made me feel icky inside. Am I the only one who thinks this situation is/was a little creepy or am I overreacting? If I am, how can I look at this to get over it? I really like Shawn and would like a future with him, but this makes me look at him differently. Thanks for reading!Summary:
Summarize: Have you done in-depth research about doing a local high school? It seems preposterous that it would take you 3 additional years to finish high school when you have (I assume) already completed 3 years. There might be some small requirement differences, but I would be shocked if it took more than 1 year over your normal grad date to complete the requirements. I know this part won't be easy to hear, but you're not depressed because you're apart from your BF. You might be sad. He might be sad. Neither of you are depressed. You are young people in "love" and you will be sad while you are apart. Nothing will change that, but there is nothing wrong with you in a clinical psychological sense because of this. If you feel the need to write bad poetry, do so (just please don't submit it here). But you will be fine after a few years cool off your teenage genitals.Summary:

Summarize: So a few hours ago i was in the coldshower. And for some odd reason the coldshower always gives me a higher libido. So i was about 5 min into my ice cold shower and suddenly my mind started to drift towards relapsing. "Hmmm i'm on day 2, theres not really much going so why not fap ?" I actually made the decision to relapse right after my coldshower but i thought let me first bake an egg. I did that, talked to my parents and went upstairs. Checked my phone for any missed calls. Bam ! i see an unknown number. My first reaction was "Don't tell me this is a call from the grocery store that i applied to". Hmmm lets give that person a call. Guess what ? i was right !! I had so much adrenaline in my body because i've been anxiously waiting for an entire week to get an answer . Tomorrow i have my interview ! at 11 AM. I'm so excited !! I applied to the same grocery store for the 3th time and finally i get a phone call ! This really made my day. My nofap lifestyle is still intact. I didn't break my vow. I have an interview tomorrow and next tuesday i'm going on vacation for two weeks to turkey !! 110 days till new years eve. Theres no way that i'm going to watch porn or masturbate ever again. Stay strong, people.Summary:
Summarize: Okay, so I'm having trouble and I don't even know what to think, so I'm just going to start ranting and if you all can help in some way, that's be great. I'm having a hard time enjoying sex right now. My girlfriend (19) and I (20) have been together for several months now and we've been having sex the past 2 months, give or take. Well lately, I've not been enjoying sex that much. I'm still attracted to her, I still get urges, but the sex seems tedious. First off, I've been very stressed recently. I'm an actor at our university and just got done putting up 3 seperate shows. I'm soon to start another 2 as well, then a final show soon as those two are over. It's been extremely stressful and tiring and I just don't have the energy for sex. Second, I feel she's not pulling her weight as much anymore. She's constantly horny (she has the sex drive I should have) and always wants me. However, she usually wants me to do the work. I'm happy to be in charge sometimes, but I'm tired and stressed and can barely focus anyway. Third, and probably the biggest thing. I can't seem to please her any more. Not long ago, I used to be able to rock her consistently. We had a particularly fun day once when I gave her 16 orgasms. But now, I've not given her 1 in weeks. And any time I try, she either stops me from pain or because she wants to "focus on me". Don't get me wrong, I'd be happy with that normally, but I want to give her at least one each time or I feel like a failure. It's no fun if it's just me getting off, I might as well just masturbate. It's getting frustrating and starting to effect our relationship. So please, just some advice would be nice. I getting fed up!Summary:
Summarize: PLEASE DON'T DOWNVOTE BECAUSE THIS IS IN /r/boxing, /r/gaming SAYS SPORTS GAMES SHOULD BE DISCUSSED IN THEIR PROPER SUBREDDITS) Sorry to come here to bitch, but the best boxing game of all time has been completely ruined by a unremovable update. To understand how fucked up this is, you must first understand how awesome the game was before the "patch". The game that was shipped was incredible. It was the absolute closest thing to a boxing simulation ever available. It built upon Fight Night Round 4's incredible leap in a realistic direction. The main way it improved with Fight Night Champion (FNC), was the addition of one punch Knock-outs. This means, no matter how far ahead you were in a fight, no matter how well you were boxing, the whole match could be over with one good shot from your opponent. JUST LIKE IN REAL LIFE!!! They also added a realistic power-punch variant and showed respect for all realistic styles of fighting. Meaning a slick speedy boxer (IE: Amir Khan) would have the same chance in a fight as a slower, strong power punch (IE: Marcos Maidana). Add in the 1-punch KO's, and the video game version of Khan vs. Maidana held the same intensity for the full fight as the real fight. Other fights styles were on equal playing field as well. Now boxers were basically made up of not only their physical attributes but accurate AI tendencies. Custom AI sliders were also added to customize the fighters even further. It was the perfect game. My nights and weekends would be spent playing careers, exhibition dream matchups and occasionally online fights. Just like the last 2 years with FN4. There was so much awesome about the game I could go on forever, but there really is one more thing that needs to be mentioned. The stamina system. The stamina system was fucking awesome! It was groundbreaking and realistic because if you threw more punches in a round than your fighter's conditioning was prepared for, you would drain stamina appropriately. BUT, you could then take a round or 2 to be in survival/conservative mode and basically rest for a couple rounds and get some back! It was incredibly realistic. Fighters throw themselves out sometimes, but rest and come back. I study the shit out of boxing, I watch the same fights over and over, this game was my absolute dream come true. Real strategic plans were needed to fight real match-ups, based on the opponents, speed, power, reach, fighting style and what punches were capable of 1-punch knockout. The more you understood boxing, the better you would be at this game, it provided the rock/paper/scissor qualities of real boxing, calling for adjustments mid-fight and realistic, unpredictable outcomes, just like real life! And then all that changed... You see, online, this system could be exploited in a few small ways. The main being, now that you could actually move around the ring, you could technically punch a guy 3 times in the stomach, back-off and run the rest of the round. Because you landed more punches technically, you could win the rounds. It was frustrating, but most people didn't fight like that and if you weren't a moron, you could adjust and counter them, or beat them at their own game. So instead of EA, changing the judging to detect such fighting styles or applying a fix just to online fighting. They applied a "fix" to the whole game. This changed the game into basically every other fighting game. It also skewed the stamina and other attributes. The realistic boxers and their respective AI now are all messed up. Smart boxers with excellent stamina, capable and known for pacing themselves now keep throwing punches when they are tired and fight completely different now. THE ONE PUNCH KNOCK-OUTS ARE COMPLETELY REMOVED FROM THE GAME!!! Even after EA sold (yes, for real money, on top of what you paid for the game) XP points for your online boxer, that WERE USED TO BUILD UP YOUR OWN ONE PUNCH KO PUNCHES. There is more to this but I know if it's too long no one will read it. But basically on (XBOX360) once you get this update you cannot remove it.Summary:
Summarize: My boss does this crap all the time. He gets payed 30 grand a year to provide desktop support and a further 40 to do app dev work (which he doesn't do at all), but has gotten into the position where a few of us part time students can do all that work for him. Needless to say, we don't cover all hours of the day (which he does and is responsible for)... and are on extremely restricted schedules due to school. He has no idea what is actually going on with desktop support and constantly hounds us about tickets that were closed hours before because he doesn't actually click the refresh button. Lately he has been taking off 9+ days a month to "work from home" where he occasionally sends messages to us about work we've already done to feel like he's still in control. He also goes swimming for an hour or two every day and attends meetings that have nothing to do with his job most of the rest of the time. <3 bosses.Summary:
Summarize: Finally, rain. A metric ton of rain. It's an older property, with a flat roof. The entire property is still generally well kept, but an older building is going to spring a leak. This time, it was the back office window. I dump out a 'trash' can and proceed to catch me some drips. Aww yiss... mitigating further water damage like a Sir. What ho?!?! There be another drip which requires yet another vessel! Thusly, I venture forth to the laundry room. To my alarm, it appears the room had started to flood. Water starts to gush in from a rear door. I immediately jam the bottom of the door with rags, and stomp them in place. Also I relocated any sensitive articles found on the ground to a higher location. As I leave the scene, seemingly victorious, I spy a slow stream of water entering the main lobby. A veritable benjo of a flood, this be! Having depleted my stock of common rags, I retreat to the kitchen for towels to forcibly apply to the rear foyer door. (Alright, I'm tired of psuedo-gilded age talk.) So I've stopped the flooding. The laundry room requires a push brooming, to send water to the drain at a faster rate. The rest is dry mop work. A yard of hallway carpet is soaked. Me do good. The water is almost up to the threshold of the front door. It only enters when a car drives under the awning. Rain stops. Whew. Unfortunately the Southeast portion of the parking lot is under approximately two feet of water. Not enough to screw up cars, but enough to stall one. Early morning comes and I've got shit more or less under control. GM, first shift FDA and HK come in. (I warned them to approach from the North.) GM knows there's a drain I wasn't aware of. They proceed to take off shoes, and socks. Then roll up their pant legs to over the knee. They grab the trusty massive push broom (does one ever not push it?). They wade into the newly-formed pond, and proceed to clear the crap covering the drain. Good job, GM. I didn't even know it was there. It was kind of fun watching it drain. The funnel was about one foot in diameter.Summary:
Summarize: It was kind of a bittersweet meet up honestly. Definitely not anything special or at all what we had discussed, but not exactly a disaster either. I'm not sure how to tell this story so I'm just going to start... My birthday is this month and he had been discussing what he wanted to do for/to me. How he wanted to just make the day all about my pleasure, sort of like the first time we slept together. He told me he got massage oil and and had been telling me he couldn't wait to get his hands on me, to tease me, and to taste me. That he wouldn't let me have his cock until I came for him. On his lips. That plan definitely went out the window. When I walked in he wrapped his arms around me and kissed me. My lips, my ears, my neck, and I was doing the same. Before I knew it he picked me up, my legs were wrapped around him, and he carried me to the desk. My dress was up around my hips and I could feel how hard he was through my thin tights. He pulled each of my legs up to his chest, running his hands the entire length, to remove my shoes as I laid back. I thought he was going to take me right there but we made it to the bed. We barely made it to the bed. He was pulling my tights off and on top of me in seconds. He left my panties on to tease me, letting me feel his hard cock against me. I reached down an pushed my panties aside and with one firm thrust I had all of him. That first moment always feels amazing. I feel so full, so tight around him. He fucked me like that, half of our clothes still on, moaning into my ear and neck, until he came. We relaxed still wrapped up in each other before finally stripping off the rest of our sweaty clothes and having a drink. We had somehow knocked the box of chocolates off the bed and wasted half of them. He laughed about how I ruined his plan and I told him there was still time. As we were talking and laughing and grazing what was left of the candy we we ended up discussing his wife and how jealous she is of one of their single neighbors and an invasion of his privacy that she did recently. I didn't know what to say and half hoped he wasn't making it up because of our communication talk recently (which we came to an agreement on anyway) and half hoped he was because it was a little crazy. Despite that awkward moment he soon had his hands on me again. I was the little spoon and he was caressing my body. Running his fingertips down my side, over my ass, gently kissing the back of my neck and nibbling my shoulder, until his fingers found their way between my thighs. He growled into my ear, mmm, as he does, "you're so wet for me" and I moved my ass against him so he could get inside me. I responded with a soft moan and told him I wanted him. He kept massaging my clit with his figers, his other hand across my chest holding me close, as he slowly but firmly pushed himself into me over and over, sending little waves of pleasure throughout my body. I could hear his breath quicken, even over my own noises, feel it against my neck. I was pushing back against him, my legs trembling, mumbling incoherent "yes"s between moans as he kept his pace. The perfect pace. As I started to cum he forced himself as deep as he could get and held his cock there, his fingers making just the right movements to take me over the edge, the arm over my chest held me tightly as I shook. After enjoying that for a few moments I rolled back against him, throwing a leg on each side, without losing his cock I was riding him backwards. This always makes me laugh a little because it reminds me of the "crab walk" game in elementary school. So, as I can't believe that is sexy, I sat up into reverse cowgirl. He loves looking at my ass and squeezing it and seeing me take him in. After what I believed was a good workout I hopped off and wrapped my mouth around him. I sucked all of my juices off of him. But I could only go so long wothout it and I started riding him again, leaning over to nibble his ears. The way he was grabbing me, the almost grunts I could hear, I knew he wanted it harder so I gave it to him, but before long he had me on my back again, with a pillow underneath me and my legs over his shoulders. He knows I love this, the slow deep thrusts and the way it makes his pelvis rub against my clit. It wasn't long befire my knees were buckling again and he started riding me hard, pushing my body towards the edge of the bed. By the time we finished my head and shoulders were hanging off. We didn't notice this but the clock in the room was an hour ahead so we didn't think we had much time afterward. We layed there relaxing and laughing and snuggling until he got into the shower. I watched him get dressed longingly and he came back to bed. It is always so hard for either of us to leave, and he started teasing me again. He was kissing my neck, which drives me crazy, and I alid his hand between my legs to show him exactly how crazy. Once he felt how badly I wanted him he started using thise fingers. Moaning and writhing he asked "can I make you cum like this?". I had to be honest. The answer was no. No one can, I barely can make it work myself. So he left me like that! All worked up wth no release. . . . . .Summary:
Summarize: My friend has a cabin with a pond next to it. It was basically our school's party spot when there was nowhere to drink. Well, a few of my friends went out there during the summer while my parents were away, so I figured, no problem, I'll go there, pass out, and drive back whenever. I thought we were gonna drink beer, but there were only so many left, only got four. Then someone pulls out a bag of weed, and the cabin kid suggests we go smoke on the rowboat. Weed guy mentions this being some strong shit. We're all just chilling smoking out a bowl. Spoilers: it doesn't tip. When I say this was strong shit, I mean, it was on steroids, possibly literally. Cabin guy suggests it was laced jokingly. He hardly got anything out of his hits. I like to watch smoke in the air, and his were definitely too inadequate to be feeling what I was. I started staring deep into the water, sweating quite a bit. It wasn't just the sun, my heart was racing. Other weed smoking friend says that he definitely thinks it was laced. Told us our source wasn't the regular guy he goes to. Shit starts getting weird for me here. I'm no longer lucid, I'm completely mind blown and out of it. Someone's asking if I'm okay. They sound like a mile away. I start to frown, but I don't know why. I look over at my should which feels red hot. There's a motherfucking horse fly straight up and down biting into my goddamn shoulder. My screams and yells get everyone's attention. Cabin kid yell "HOLY SHIT!" I'm unsure if that's what alerted me to the fly or if it was after, but now he's telling the story of how it landed there moved around a ton, bit a little, then a little more, then the thing was straight up and down practically humping my skins while biting. I could tell I was too high. I remember drinking a ton of juice and water chilling in the cabin for a while then waking up in my bed at 5 pm the next day covered in sweat.Summary:
Summarize: So, I am 26 and have an above-average penis size -- at least from what I have read in various publications. I'm a little over six inches, good girth, never had any problems with my tool. I've been in a relationship for the last eight months, give or take. My girlfriend is great, the love of my life. We get along amazingly and along with that comes the best sex of my life. Really, sex with her just keeps getting better and better -- and we do it a good amount. Some days we will have sex two or three times, but every time we are together (we don't currently share a residence) we usually fornicate at least one time. In the past couple months, my girlfriend keeps saying that my penis is getting bigger. I always say, "Ha ha, yeah right. I wish," but I am not a physiological expert nor am I one to just let things go and not think about it. Her reasoning is that nowadays, I get really hard all the time. My penis is like a cobblestone, or a jackhammer -- whichever you prefer. It's on another level and I am actually wondering, is my penis growing or is it just functioning at a sexual peak? My girlfriend must have a lot to do with this. I honestly don't masturbate all that much (couple times a week), but I have been having sex since I was 18 and I have never been this hard this often. My penis feels like a super penis, at least to me. So, is it crazy to suggest that a penis can grow after 26 years of living? It's almost like one of those things, when you hear it so much for so long, you start to wonder if it could actually be true. If I'm crazy for even thinking that, I would appreciate that feedback as well.Summary:
Summarize: Google Play tried to charge my card at 3am last night but I was short £1 because I'd transferred too much into my savings account. FFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUU! I've now transfered enough money back but fuck knows how long it will be before they try to charge my card again.Summary:
Summarize: I feel that you guys are giving way too much hate about russians. Everytime I get into a match and a russian opens his mouth, everyone goes bananas and mock him. If he chokes and fails to kill one, everyone put blames on him. Always complain the russians. I've met countless russians who have been very cooperative, some can be ragey and some can be very very ignorant. A couple of weeks ago, I was playing nuke and I had 3 russians and 1 dude(forgot the name of the country). It was 6-0 to the enemy team and this dude was sure angry about the russians because they barely got any kills and they haven't said a single thing, he sure complained a lot to the enemy team, then he asked me how I felt about them, I told him "I don't dislike russians but I dislike people who won't communicate". All the russians started to communicate we won the match easily, the dude never said a single bad word about them. If you guys always complain and put the blame on the russians, of course they will perform super bad, they get frustrated every match and no one is willing to give them a chance. This way they will never improve. It's not only the russians, this whole rage, toxic thing applies to everyone. Some people screams/mock them because they can't speak english. For fuck sake people, give them a fucking chance because they're trying at least. This will only destroy their confident and they will never try to talk in english again.Summary:
Summarize: I found a pretty easy way to beat her, but be warned this method is kinda cheap. On the lower-left hand of the room, there's a small area you can stand which is close enough to the left door so that her foot doesn't come down, but it's also too far for her hand to hit you. From there, you can only be damaged by the enemies she spawns. Just continue shooting upwards as she will continue poking her hand/eye/skin out of the door and you'll get free shots off on her. The enemies she spawns is limited to a maximum of 3 in the room at a time. If you're really lucky, you'll get something like flies on the far right side of the room that won't even aggro to you. If that happens, you're basically home free. You can stand there and shoot her while she has no way of hitting you. Also, familiars that do damage upon touch do tons of damage.Summary:
Summarize: When i was a kid (12 or 13 years ago), i loved to play with peruvians. Gunbound, Ragnarok and Neopets were common places to find them, nice and shy ppl almost everytime. > > > > And then came the future, i was a happy person, i swear. A friend said to me: hey, play Dota with me, is a lot of fun but be aware of peruvians. What, i said, peruvians?, but they are nice ppl!, maybe some with which you played were assholes, but we all are assholes sometimes, don't we? Months have passed, and 800 hours later, for the first time, in a match that ended minutes ago, i had to say: DAMN PERUVIANS, WHAT WERE THEY THINKING!! WHY EVERYTIME I PLAY WITH ONE IS ALL "tmr gg, asco, aggg, comentenme, report" WHY, WHYYYY!! I just want to report all of them. > > > > Maybe, after all this matches playing with they, i became a peruvian too. Sorry Reddit. Sorry Perú. > > > >Summary:
Summarize: I asked this a long time ago back on s3. Sejuani was a hard CC tank jungler with great long range initiate with her ultimate. You guys said that Sejuani was not picked in pro play because she doesnt have safe wave clear when helping the top laner in 2v1 lanes. But with s4 champions like Wukong have been in the jungle for weeks now with great success that offers teams great initiates with synergy with Lulu. Right now, season 4, do you think Sejuani has the capability to be picked in the professional scene?Summary:
Summarize: So, askreddit asked me what advice I had for the younger crowd and this was my contribution. I was too late to the party and nobody will see it, so I'm shamelessly copying it here. Not only does venting feel that much better when someone actually reads it, but I WISH I read a post like this two years ago. So here it goes; I'm not really old, but I'm sad to say that when it comes to buying a house I've grown old out of a bad experience. So, I'll give you; "How to buy a house" . Option 1 : You're buying a new house with all the warranty that comes with it. Well, it's going to cost you, but it's great. Good choice. Make sure the company is a serious one because if it goes belly up during your warranty period you might get fucked. There's not much else that can go wrong here. Spend the extra dollars of having a professional go through the house before the warranty expires just to be sure. No problem Option 2: You're buying a really old house, it looks like shit, and your getting it dirt cheep. Hey, you got a big job ahead, or money set aside to pay someone to fix it up. Either way, that's not a problem because you know this place is a shithole and that's what you're paying for. Option 3: You're buying a old house, but it's partly or completely renovated. Who cares if it's old right? It looks so great, and even though your paying a lot for that newly renovated standard it's still a tad cheaper than a new place right? Great deal right? NO, WRONG . Now is the time to be fucking careful my friend. Anyone can pick up dog shit, wrap it in foil and put a nice little ribbon on it. Looks like fine Belgian chocolate now does it not? Well, it's fucking dog shit. Anyone can paint old rotten wood, and it will look great for about six months. Then you can enjoy the sweet taste of dog shit as it seeps through the tin foil and between your stupid teeth. Anyone can put down some fine ass tiles on a old bathroom, but you won't know if it's really well done until a year later when the bedroom downstairs is either dry or wet as fuck with Winnie the poo and all kinds of shit living in a moldy forest between your floors. But Warcraft MD are you saying I should just stick with option 1 or 2? That really limits available houses. Yeah, it does. But a moldy fuck forest behind your bedroom walls will really limit your lungs, and your wallet if you ever wish to try and resell the godforsaken peace of shit house, that is. So if you HAVE to go with option 3, here's what you do: You can't see the important parts of the house, so be really up tight about the parts you can see. Is there a piece of missing paint at the bottom of the wall by the corner? Who cares right? You can pick up a paint brush and fix that shit up in no time. Probably just some old damage from a kid or a dog or something right? Does not matter, right? FUCKING WRONG . It means the people who live here do not care about details, if they could not pick up a paint brush before selling their newly renovated house they sure as hell did not do a proper job on all the other shit they did either. Is one fucking tile slightly miss-aligned? Don't buy that fucking house or that tile will forever stare you down while your sitting on your throne trying to force out a shit into your shitty house with shitty pipes knowing that you will forever be in a shitty place economically because of he shitty decision you made when you bought a shitty ass house with a shitty ass tile that tried to warn you about how shitty your life could become.Summary:
Summarize: As someone who has 25 hours on mercy i have to say that most soloq teams are just fine as long as you know how to play mercy. You died? 80% of the time that's just bad positioning on your part. Yes, there is the occasional horrible team out there, but lets be honest, most of them aren't half bad. Instead of thinking about how horrible your team is, try thinking about what you're doing wrong that's getting you killed a lot. Also remember that your pistol ^^Deals ^^a ^^surprising ^^amount ^^of ^^damage isn't completely useless, and you can usually kill that tracer/genji if your aim isnt horrible. A widow is constantly asking you to heal her? Well how about, I dont know, healing her? Just because someone is asking you to do your job, doesn't mean they're being jerks.Summary:
