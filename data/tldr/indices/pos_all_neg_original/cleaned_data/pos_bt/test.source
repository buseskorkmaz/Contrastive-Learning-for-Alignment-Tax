State of mind is the most important aspect. A rapper commissioned me (for free lol) to make a scary/horror beat so i went and downloaded the entire score from "the cabinet of dr. Caligari," which is an early 20th century german silent horror film. Since its silent, the only sounds are the accompanying orchestra. I sat and listened to the the full hour and a half long score and ended up sampling bits and pieces for the track: I heard that dissonant ode to joy on the bells and the rest is history. TL;DR
Abstract: The state of mind is the most important aspect. A rapper charged me (for free lol) to make a scary/horror rhythm, so I downloaded the entire score from Dr Caligari's cabinet, which is a German silent horror film of the early 20th century. Since his silence, the only sounds are the orchestra that accompanies him. I sat down and listened to it all the time and a half long score and I ended up sampling songs for the track: I heard this ode dissonant to joy on the bells and the rest is the story.
Over the summer I had an internship at an office that upgraded all of their monitors so I was able to take two of the older model for use at school. The model of both of the monitors is HP L2045w. I am trying to use them with my laptop, which is a Dell XPS L702X. The monitors each have a DVI-D and a VGA connection. I am trying to use the DVI connection on each of them to avoid any issues with HDCP and for the simplicity of not having to convert to analog. The laptop has a mini display port and an HDMI port. Either monitor works with this mini display port to DVI-D cable ( and neither monitor works with either of these two HDMI to DVI-D cables that I have tried ( or The computer can obviously handle multiple displays, because it is working with the mini display port cable. I previoulsy checked to make sure it should be able to drive both monitors and its own display all at once and it should, but that should be besides the point since it isn't working even when only one monitor is connected via HDMI to DVI-D. These cables (HDMI to DVI-D) work with a projector I have that also has a DVI-D port and no HDMI input (the projector model is Epson EMP-810UG). It doesn't seem that the monitors are broken, because they are behaving consistently and it seems unlikely that they are both broken identically and the same port on the monitor works when connected to a different port on the computer. The monitors do seem to respond when the cable is connected, but they display a "NO INPUT SIGNAL" message followed quickly by a "MONITOR GOING TO SLEEP" message then they become unresponsive until they are powered off and back on again. I have tried everything I can think of to figure out why this is not working and I have not been able to find a solution. I cannot identify an exact component that is malfunctioning, and I have multiples of every component except the laptop and everything is behaving consistently so it doesn't seem like any one part is broken. Thank you for any insight you can provide and sorry for such a long winded explanation; this issue has become increasingly frustrating over the past several weeks. TL;DR

not sure if this is a vent. it feels odd. 8 weeks ago our pekingese gave birth to 5 puppies fathered by my little shih tzu buddy. 7 from the last sentence. we also had a shih-poo and a cocker spaniel/golden retriever mix. it was arranged to get rid of 2 of the puppies yesterday as they were ready to leave. 9-2=7. she put an ad on craigslist to get rid of the shih-poo and the coggle for free. an hour later a couple showed up to take the shih-poo. in the morning a middle aged single lady comes to pick up the coggle. 7-2=5. I wanted to keep the one puppy [Peanut]( he was cool. being emotionally attached to an entity and it leaving is a feeling I'm not used to, especially since 4 left. shrug. here's the [puppies at my feet]( the one on the very right, and the second from the left departed. [these two left as well]( TL;DR

Forgive me for being a bit general. USE YOUR EAR! A professor once told me ear training is musicianship, and being a jazz guy (among other things) I tend to agree. To me it sounds like you're trying do be a musician in a way that's more suited to engineering or physics. Understanding music in a meaningful way requires being able to master at least some theoretical concepts, and understanding/physical mastery, but also the utilitarian method of using them well and efficiently. So, what I'm saying is force yourself to do things differently. Sit down with your guitar (I assume you don't play another fretted instrument primarily) and play progressions using only inversions. It might sound weird. Or only play Lydian mode over a certain progression, and stick with it. The stuff in your head has to come out of your instrument effortlessly, as an ideal. TL;DR

How am I insulting them? I am stating clearly that their philosophy is suboptimal and even simple logic proves it. Balance for the masses: Makes the balance for competitive play bad (unstable, strict meta, boring, loopsided, plagued by the same issues again and again), makes the balance for all other demographics... Also bad. The demographics - how many million players, again? - are so numerous, different, their wants and "needs" so volatile, change day to day... You can't balance specifically with them in mind. It's a self-defeating task. Balance for competitive play/the pros: Makes the balance for competitive play good, makes the balance for all other demographics... Also good. How? Simple, everyone else adapts. They don't know any better. Some will still bitch and complain, but still play. Some won't even notice that the balance is being aimed at the pros, they will merely keep playing, not notice anything different and just "adapt". Meanwhile the pros get a more stable yet less constricted playing field to work with, more viable Champions... Speaking of which, funny that you mention J4 possibly being too strong (I don't even want to entertain the notion that Vi is too strong) and that they should nerf them, as the outliers . No, of course not. Why the hell would you nerf them?!? J4 isn't oppressive, neither is Vi. They don't deserve nerfs. Useless Junglers with outdated kits deserve buffs. Weak and forgotten Champions require partial or full remakes, some others simply need numerical tweaks. The fact that you think they need nerfs is... Well, it shows that you do think like Riot. "Boo hoo, if we do that, power creep, bla bla" - standard excuse with no justification. No one is saying that, if you buff other junglers now, that you will then buff J4 in the future, then the others again, and thus enter a vicious cycle. That doesn't make sense. It's basically a "slippery slope" fallacy. That would never happen... Some Champs only need a single set of buffs/remakes and that is it. From then on, you tweak them with small nerfs and buffs either way. The myth that this approach - buffing loads of weak Champs instead of constantly nerfing the "outliers" - would cause a power creep is laughable, baseless. It would imply that Riot are morons (which I don't think they are); there is no other scenario bar them being stupid where such an approach would fail. If anything there is a negative power creep going on right now (for ages, really) due to the way they have been balancing, via nerfing the "outliers"; especially with constantly removing/nerfing CC and non-skillshot abilities as well. Not to mention the always present mobility creep. Do they do anything about the mobility creep? Of course not. God forbid they add Cripple (the form of CC originating in Smite) and make other Summoner Spells more powerful to quell the prevalent nature of Flash. That would be too hard, despite the fact that it would improve every aspect of the game without hurting its core identity. Meanwhile - and these are outliers* - they constantly release broken Champions. Azir? Far too strong, despite squishiness. Rek'Sai? Badly designed Champion, simply far too weak... That everyone picked and banned because of her ridiculous damage output that got nerfed within 2 patches. No one notices that though, and, soon, she will fall into obscurity until she (like many others should) receives a minor remake akin to Sejuani's. Kalista? Do I really need to say anything about her? I'm sitting here trying to think of a weakness... But, no, me calling her broken (in the standard OP way) got ignored, got downvoted... And then NA LCS happened. "Oh wow she is so OP". TL;DR

Gather 'round children, it's story time. Basically it was more of a "cyber cheating" thing, but it still counts. Got her into gaming, after we were going out for a little over a year (December) she started a long-distance relationship with a guy she met on Live (through a game I bought her no less). I found out that it started after a few weeks and she swore it was done. I knew who he was because he was in the clan we were both part of (which she got me kicked out of). Time went on, I was still suspicious. Seeing her in video chats for long periods of time, ignoring me when I tried to text, call, etc. But she was pretty and has boobs and can lie really well. I went on like a dumbass still believing it, started playing WoW. At some point she deletes me from her facebook because I was "stalking" her. Not sure if you're able to stalk your girlfriend with anything short of a cell phone/email tap. But come November, 2 year anniversary and still suspicious. Got her Reach at some point, decided to check her play history. SURPRISE! I see the guy's gamertag all over her games. Hours of coop, plenty of other shit too. Her excuse? "Oh it's just his little brother being a dick and trying to piss you off". Dumbass me, still liking boobs, buys that shit. It takes about another month before I finally go "fuck that", check her facebook and see shit all about how much she looooves Tyler. My name is not Tyler. So then I just go drown my sorrows in WoW for the next 6 or 7 months. Now I hear she's run off to the other side of the country to be with that guy, they're married (and she's like 20 years old, left right when she graduated), she got fat, and he's likely cheating on her. I, however, have lost a bunch of weight and am kicking ass at college. TL;DR
I had her in the game, after having released for a little more than a year (December) she started a long distance relationship with a guy she met on Live (through a game I didn't buy her less). I found out that it started after a few weeks and she swore it was over. I knew who he was because he was in the clan that we both called each other (which she got me fired from). The time went by, I saw him in video conversations for long periods, ignoring me when I tried to write him, call him, etc. But she was pretty and had tits and can really lie.
I really hate this sort of approach. Don't get me wrong, I have severe problems with these pesky "MRA's" and generally view them as a proxy used by right wingers as a way to pull people into right wing ideologies that would abuse women based on 2 or 3 valid complaints (more on that later) To be blunt, You are a reactionary, "A reactionary is a person who holds political viewpoints that favor a return to a previous state" ( Statelessness was in fact a previous state of humanity, and you favor a return to it. Unless you think it refers to a political state in which case the "state" that abused women never left, only changed(slightly) I hate HATE these stupid shitty buzzwords that people use. Partriachy, Reactionary, White Privledge These words they mean NOTHING, but they sound stupid White privledge elicits images of every white person sitting around a tea table with monocles, when in fact You mean the Disadvantages faced by people who are perceived "minorities" IE low employment figures and lower wages, this also affects women Regardless of race. Reactionary , Guy's people react to things, Women where treated like shit for huge amounts of time, They REACTED GASP! and started a hugely successful rights movement. Any anarchist in Any area that was previously controlled by anarchist forces is a REACTIONARY because they're trying to re-establish previous political gains. " but wait! it has right wing connotations, " only in 20th century Europe, you fail to realise that generally people don't know WTF you're talking about because Only avid anarchists and marxists Know of the right wing history of the word, Thy usage of Frivolous outdated Words Misleads normal people for no good reason Patriachy I haven't been able to find the actual definition of this one. as far as i can tell Some femenists made it up, and nobody realised that most people have no idea what you're talking about So when ever a feminists uses the word I'm stuck there wondering if i agree with you or not. I can tell you that these MRA's don't get peoples attention by saying "rape is exciting, bitches love it" they lure people in by pointing at / declaring Murderous rants that generalize all men as evil rapists who should die[^1]( Implying that sposual abuse isnt taken seriously when men are the victims ^2 the rape of men is underreported and more servere than you expect(possibly true, TL;DR
I really hate this kind of approach. Don't hurt me, I don't have any serious problems with these "MRA " and usually consider them as a proxy used by right wingers as a way to attract people into right-wing ideologies that would abuse women on the basis of 2 or 3 valid complaints (later) To be blunt, You are reactionary, "A reactionary is a person who holds political views that favor a return to a previous state" (statelessness was actually a previous state of humanity, and you prefer a return to it.

The Commission's proposal for a directive on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the classification, packaging and labelling of dangerous substances and preparations for use in foodstuffs and foodstuffs (COM(2003) 649 final) is based on the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection on the proposal from the Commission to the Council (COM(2003) 747 final) for a directive on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the labelling of dangerous substances and preparations (COM(2003) 747 final).
Street youth can't be considered a "state" that can't be a "state" in which women abuse people, but they can be a "state" in which the "state" in which women abuse never leave, they just change their minds, they hate these stupid shitty words that people actually use. Partriachy, Reactionary, White Privedge These words mean NADA, but they sound like a "state" in which women abuse people never leave, I just like people who are going to listen to people who are going to listen to people who are going to listen to people who are going to listen to people who listen to people who listen to people who listen to people who listen to people who listen to people who listen to people who listen to people who listen to people who listen to people who listen to people who listen to people who listen to people who listen to people who listen to people who listen to people who listen to people who listen to people who listen to people who listen to people who listen to people who listen to people who listen to people who listen to people who listen to people who listen to people who listen to people who listen to people who listen to people who listen to people who listen to people who listen to people who listen to people who listen to people who listen to people who listen to people who listen to people who listen to people who listen to people who listen to people who listen to people who listen to people who listen to people who listen to people who listen to people who listen to people who listen to people who listen to people who listen to people who listen to people who listen to people who listen to people who listen to people who listen to people who listen to people who listen to people who listen to people who listen to people who listen to people who listen to people who listen to people who listen to people who listen to people who listen to people who listen to people who listen to people who listen to people who listen to people who listen to people who listen to people who listen to people who listen to people who listen to people who listen to people who listen to people who listen to people who listen to people who listen to people who listen to people who listen to people who listen to people who listen to people who listen to people who listen to people who listen to people who listen to people who listen to people who listen to people who listen to people who listen to people who listen to people who listen to people who listen to people who listen to people who listen to people who listen to people who
Don't get caught in simply making moves according to a scheme. It's more beneficial to try and play chess and figure things out yourself and make moves for your own reasons. For instance the Botvinnik system with e4/d3/c4 is usually played against a pawn on ..e5 or ..c5 for black. Black made no effort to occupy the center and I am sure you had the opportunity at some point to play the principled d4. TL;DR
That's how it sounds to me, a rotary style with compression and ignition tuned to occur at the wave front. Wave compression tuning is kind of a new thing, there was some talk of using it to ignite and sustain fusion reactions for fusion power.

My girlfriend and I both attend college, and we're on our Christmas break. All but two of her friends from high school have gone to different schools, and she says she has trouble making new friends in college. She still does have people to hang out with though. Over the break, she's been hanging with her friends and blowing me off quite often. Today, she texted me asking what I was doing. She went on to say she was bored. I said let's hang out. She said she wanted something to do, not to just sit around. I suggested the park, she said it was too wet, then told me she was going to hang with her friend and 'maybe' we'd meet later. She ended up bailing on me. We've hung out and had good times this break, but sometimes I feel ignored. I feel like I'm a backup. I understand that she misses her friends and she wants to take advantage of the break to see them, but she hangs out with them almost every day and doesn't seem to want to make time for me. I feel like she only hangs out with me if her friends are unavailable. And when we do hang out, it's often with her family. We have had little alone time. Some supporting information: at school, we hang out almost every day. We've both told each other 'I love you.' The relationship was great ever since this break started. This break is a month long and I'd say 70 percent of it has been spent with her friends; which is why I feel like she could make a little bit of time for me. When I tell her how I feel she says she knows she has the whole school year to spend time with me and that she does miss hanging out with me, but it never seems genuine. ** TL;DR
First off let me say that I really love my OB. She is really nice and I feel comfortable around her. But... when I went to my appointment on Friday something struck me as odd. I've had an U/S in the small exam room before (previous pregnancy that did not survive) and it got cramped with everyone in it. The machine they used worked really well that time and I could see everything clearly. This time they put us in the small exam room at first, but when I came back from the bathroom we were put into a larger room. This room had a really old machine in it. The doctor and nurse even had a hard time figuring out how to use it because it was so old. When they got it "working" (and I say with " " because they couldn't get the doppler working) we couldn't see anything except the flicker of the heartbeat. So my OB says I will have to go to the hospital to get an U/S. I'm confused because they have several machines (I'm not sure how many work or whatever), but now I have to travel all the way to her hospital to get an ultrasound. They won't even take me for another 3 weeks because of how early I am. All these appointments are starting to add up with time off from work for myself and my husband. So I'm just wondering if this is normal or if my OB is trying to squeeze money out of me or what. TL;DR
I've gotten to a point in HL where "carrying" from support, i consider knowing who specifically to heal and keep alive in fights, or keeping everyone alive with a decent amount of health to be carrying for me specifically, is near impossible. Currently at about 2650 mmr on hotslogs, was about 2800 before the losing streak. Was 1 win away from rank 8, but I just lost a few in a row and i've been demoted just about to rank 11. I always try not to just blame my teammates, and I focus on my own play. But I can't figure out too many ways that I personally can improve. Even if I'm partied up, or solo, I'm having lots of problems. So any high elo supports that have climbed or climbing pretty easily that can offer me some actual advice? I do play other roles just fine when another support players pick a support before I do, so that's not really a problem for me. TL;DR

year and 3 months. half of it was online (long distance relationship), the other half we lived together. we had arguments from time to time but infinite number of happy moments. he took me down the road less taken, he showed me the world painted in beautiful colors, he raised me up, he made me invincible and he made me the happiest person on the planet. when he was next to me, I felt like I was on the top of the world. I was far from perfect but I made it clear that I want to change. and I tried, and I did. im still not perfect but so help me god I want to be. he deserves it. I want to see the smile in his eyes, I want to make him feel the same way he makes me feel every day I thought I did a good job, until yesterday when we had a small argument on the phone . we haven't seen eachother for 4 months and he was supposed to come in a week. a week. 4 most painful months of my life . I got a job and I found us an apartment here and he was supposed to come in a week and also get a job, and stay forever. I made lots of little gifts and put them everywhere in the apartment so he would be surprised when he accidentally stumbles upon them. I planned to buy him a new bike today so when he comes, we could go on rides together. I planned a surprise vacation for us when he comes. basically 90% of my thoughts in the past 4 months while we were separated, were about us and how much fun we will have when he finally comes to live with me. the other 10% I was crying cause at times it became physically unbearable for me to be strong and endure long distance (I literally mean it, he probably doesn't know but the way my body reacts when my mind is trapped within bad thoughts is horrible. I throw up all the time, I have arrhythmia, headaches, I stop eating for days, my hands are shaking, I don't talk to friends or family or anyone). when I would finish with work, when I would finish having a wonderful conversation with him, when I would finish all chores, I would end up alone with no distractions, and my mind would start thinking about the fact that hes not here, and I would literally go crazy. I forced myself to work 12h a day (including weekends) and to do silliest things (singing outloud, meditating, drawing, even cooking (and i hate cooking), getting lost in this new city on purpose just so it would take me hours to get back to my empty apartment)). yesterday we had a small argument about "me going to a party even tho I was crying cause I missed him a minute before that" (party with my colleagues, of which 2 are professors (40 and 50 years old) and other two are best friends that ive known for 10 years and my bf is ok with them). I thought he overreact and he thought I acted immature and probably did some thing stupid (no, I would never cheat on him, id rather hang myself and he knows that (I hope)). I tried explaining myself but he didn't accept it. at one point I asked him "do you love me", he said no. he never said that before, even when he was really angry. and I have his messages from a week ago where he tells me how much he misses me and how much he loves me and how we will have fun 24/7 when he comes. how can it be that a person stops loving another person in a matter of minutes? how can it be that we practically built a whole future together here, and he leaves just like that? most likely I fucked up (and honestly I dont care if I never go to any party till the rest of my life, cause time I spend with him is infinite times better than time I spend with any other person). I love him and I would never do anything directly to hurt him, but I might do smth hurtful in my ignorance. even if I did, WAS IT ENOUGH FOR HIM TO STOP LOVING ME ALL OF A SUDDEN? Was I completely out of line? even if I was, aren't people supposed to talk about problems and solve them (especially cause I made it clear that I am willing to change EVERYTHING annoying in my behavior/logic) . I called him 100 times yesterday and today, I sent 30 messages, I apologized for what I did, I cried my eyes out. this morning, he finally went online and said "its over". just like that. I don't understand. someone help me understand, please. please. im stuck in this big apartment alone, staring at my phone and Skype, I got sick cause I didn't eat anything and I throw up everything I try to eat. i need to see him and I need to talk to him but he doesn't want to talk. the worst part is that I cant just travel to his country, otherwise id pack now and go to the airport (hes in middle east, id need someone to accompany me or to be at the airport to vouch for me, otherwise they might not let me pass). and I cant just wait for another week and see if he might change his mind and show up. I am literally clueless. If I have a problem, I always seek help from him. and now what? this is unbearable. worst of all, it doesn't make any sense.

I didn't have arguments from time to time, but an infinite number of happy moments. He took me on the less taken road, he showed me the world painted beautiful colors, he raised me so, he made me invincible and he made me the happiest person on the planet. When he was next to me, I felt I was on top of the world. I was far from perfect but I made it clear that I wanted to change. and I tried, and I did it. im still not perfect but help me God I want to be. He deserves it. I want to see the smile in his eyes, I want to make him feel the same way he makes me feel every day that I thought I did a good job, until yesterday when we had a little argument on the phone, and he was supposed to live a lot of things and he was supposed to come in a week. 4 months the most painful of my life.
I would strive that everyone who feels at home, throughout the world that I am no more than 12 years old. I had arguments from time to time, but infinitely many happy moments. He took me the street less, he showed me the world painted in beautiful colors, he picked me up, he made me invincible and he made me the happiest person on the planet. When he was next to me, I felt as I was at the top of the world. I wanted him to feel the same feeling as he felt me every day I thought I had a good job until yesterday when we had a small argument on the phone, and so we didn't see everyone coming for 4 months and he should come in a week. 4 painful months of my life. I found a job and I was having a small discussion on the phone.
In fact, the people's life part of the family, the people's life part of the friends people, made me a happier person on the planet. When he was next to me, I felt like people were at the top of the world people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people people
Okay so... I played a game an hour ago that was for sure a loss so we surrendered and I exited the client to go do something else without looking at the post game. I log on and check my match history to find that the match was actually a win. I know for sure that my team voted 5 to 0 for a forfeit and it was right before our nexus exploded too. I got the IP for a win and I check my opponents and they have it recorded as a loss even though they should have won. Is this even possible? TL;DR

I see a lot of talk of balance here... Look Ive run quite a few epic games. Its simple: While balance is an important part of early and mid game , it begins to fade out the higher you go. at some point people need to quite whining about balance and just have some fun. It you've worked your way up to 16th or higher then as far as im concerned, Forget about balance. Your nearly a demi god. Act like it. And for GMs who want to know how to balance high or epic level games? Don't. When your PCs are twinkling with Magic gear, pumped full of inherit bonuses, Mythic levels, Minor artifacts, Intelligent weapons and class abilities, then CRs and stuff don't work. Its like in Dragon ball Z with the Power levels. The creators of the show explained that as the series went further the PLs were meant to become useless. Specifically to show that while Goku and the others had seemingly low PLs the would still win because of things that couldn't be measured such as ingenuity, adaptability and Tenacity. Thus rendering the whole system irrelevant. And in High/epic games the same is true for Challenge ratings. if they are 20+, just drop a freakin Kaiju out in the ocean and let it rampage, let them figure out how to stop it. Im sure they will come up with something. or at the very least they will go out in one helluva spectacular display of explosions and rainbows when they Die fighting it! Don't specifically try to Screw your PCs over, but also don't be afraid to pull out the Big, ridiculously absurd way too over sized guns. because odds are they can handle it. Maybe not in pure numbers like HP, AC or saves, but when PCs can drop Wish/miracle, have artifacts, can Plane jump, summon near godlike beings to command.... then who knows what can happen. Maybe they will find some ancient ritual to summon their own Kaiju and posses it. so one of the PCs can pilot it ... Its epic levels. Fun trumps all. At lvl 20 you say, " Alright guys. All bets are off. From here on out ever game session is playing for keeps. Win or lose, Live or Die" And even if a PC dies by lvl 20 its easy to come back and fight again. TL;DR
Here's a little background information. When I was four, we moved from one state to another. We moved in with my stepdad, whom I became very close with. We were a lot closer than my mom and I and the time. Fast forward 9 years, my mom want to move out, away from him. At first I had a choice. I choose to stay with my stepdad. My mom didn't like this, so she changed her mind and made me move back to my hometown with her. I live there, mostly staying with my aunt, who pretty much became my second mom. Mom #1 would go off places once we got our own apartment, so I ended up staying at my aunt's house most of the time. I forge a life, start planning everything for high school. Over the summer, while my mom's in California, she gives me a call. I try to tell her about my high school plans, and she cuts in, telling me that we're moving to a town a hundred miles away, to her boyfriends house. I'm generally unhappy for a while, then I learn to love it. This place was amazing. A small college town, but with a great high school, people are kind. I discovered things I now love, such as rock climbing and backpacking. I make close friends that I cherish and adore. There, I got into a college prep program. They'll help me apply for scholarships and cover all application fees. They have a summer program in which I stayed in a dorm for six weeks, two summers in a row. I met many great people with ambitions like mine. I visited many colleges, including a school of the arts that has program for 11th and 12th graders. While I was there... my mom was still lacking in the mothering department, too far up my new stepdad's ass. I don't mind so much, as I am used to this. But the second summer, the moved to California. I stayed behind for 6 weeks to finish the summer program. Over the weekends, I stayed with my boyfriend's family. And his mom showed me what a mom is really supposed to be like. I didn't want to leave. Fast forward to now. I'm in California. School starts in a few days. I've asked my mother to let me go back to my home state so that I may go to the school of the arts I mentioned earlier. It's free, if you can get in, and it would be a great opportunity. I also want to be around my supportive family and friends. TL;DR

Hello, i am posting this because i had a weird experience. Wanted to know if it was a lucid dream or not. It basically goes like this: Came back at midnight one day went asleep but woke up at 7(went to toilet) then saw clock thought it was too early So stayed in bed trying to sleep. Thing is i wasnt going back to my normal unconscious sleep but i noticed i could set up a not so vivid at start sleep. Imagined having awesome football(soccer) skills double kicks front 10 meters high incredible accuracy etc. but at start it felt fake no clear images like i knew it wasnt a real dream. I couldnt change much during dream only at beginning as i was losing control it kept getting more and more vivid. It wasnt the only dream i had after the football 1 i had weird pitstop with cartoon people and normal people. I tried doing reality checks but i couldnt force myself into it my actually doing 1(this was at start when i had some power) it didnt feel too vivid or believable more like an idea that took life and own turns TL;DR

It goes essentially like this: came back at midnight one day fell asleep but woke up at 7 (go to the toilet) then saw clock thought it was too early So stayed in bed trying to sleep. Thing is that I did not return to my normal unconscious sleep but I noticed that I could install a step so sharp at the beginning of sleep. Imagined having great football skills (soccer) double blows in front of 10 meters of incredible high precision etc. but at first it felt false not clear images as I knew it was not a real dream. I couldn't change much during dream only at the beginning that I was losing control that it was getting more and more alive. It was the only dream I had after football 1 I had strange pitstop with people of animated drawing and normal people. I tried to make checks of reality but I couldn't really get any more alive that I couldn't make it feel like I was really doing too much of it myself when I felt like I was doing too much of it. I was getting too much of the life.

You shouldn't be letting a melee range tank be getting that close to you in the forst place. Proper positioning and kiting with even slightly decent peel from your team you should be chunking her hard enough to either not have to worry about her killing you before she gets to you or making her run away because she's taking too much damage. Adc's arent meant to blow people up immediately, they're meant to consistently deal moderate damage over the course of a team fight leading to overall dealing more damage than the other roles. They're also the best turret killers in the game and one of the big reasons why they've been a staple to a balanced team since the beginning, something I don't think people put enough value on. TL;DR

This can be attributed to a few things. First, almost everyone I know who smokes does not plan to do anything for a while, while many people go to a planning bar to drive home. (Yes, yes, anecdotal evidence. I know. Please, I'm not mistaken if you think I am.) Secondly, it does not take into account tolerance. Being someone who has spent a lot of time in and around bars (grew in one, have worked in one, are always related to one), I will say that I know a lot of people who can be above the legal limit, and have no effects of drunkenness. If one of these people were sitting at a stop-fire while sober (even if above the limit) and a car hit them and killed, he would be contributing to the drunk driver, and included in the statistics do not drink more than hours of consumption.
the question is a bit general, but usually the computer wants to display some menu when you right click. What happens is that the computer has to collect information about what to display (and what will happen when you click something), but this task might be delayed because the place the computer looks up information from looks more like a kindergarden playroom than the city library it once used to be. TL;DR
Yeah that's what I mean by tried to make small moves that just didn't really pan out like Belanger was great for faceoffs but really hasn't been good enough to be a regular player. Fistric came over and it was debatable how effective he was but also I think he played with Potter and Whitney quite a bit (could be wrong) and neither of those guys are really mobile enough players to cover for a d man that takes risks looking for hits like Fistric does. Mike Brown was a valuable add guys like Eager actually Eager was great when he was playing well and then he showed you why there wasn't a lot of interest in him when he took bad penalties and hurt the team. I guess they could've made some more moves that could've panned out but sometimes opportunities weren't really there like I know some people said ohh why not claim J. Jokinen but he has a relatively big contract and is another left handed C/LW so he wasn't really right for what the needed. Obviously Smithson it's unknown how well he is as a role player at this point but the hardest thing to evaluate with some of the role players is just that the games don't mean anything now. The post trade deadline tank makes it a lot harder to put a negative lens on things, at the deadline this team was in the playoffs/ right on the edge. The good news though is that the forward core is strong and just needs some pieces added but guys like Paajarvi and Gagner really showed their worth this year and made it clear it's not just the big 4 who can be long term contributors to the team. The D prospects there are some guys who should be pretty good players Klefbom and Marincin and then another layer of guys who are further away but might still pan out Musil, Gernat etc. The forwards aren't looking as promising (high end) at least not in the near future but a couple of the kids should compete for jobs next year like Lander and Hartekainen and help round out the bottom 6. TL;DR
First of all, there is a strong tradition of Jewish influence in the United States. After Israel, there were more Jews on the planet, between five and eight million United States, depending on how religion and ethnicity are built. Jewish voting [constant] (predicted the presidential election; Jewish groups have a lot of weight in lobbying and politics. Despite anti-Semitic stereotypes, there are many Jewish business owners, especially in finance and banks: Goldman Sachs, Bloomberg, Citigroup, Kuhn, Loeb & Co., etc. They are also important in other business, especially in publishing and the media.
I'm not a CPA, but I like to do my own taxes. A write-off is something that you can deduct from your gross income. It lowers the amount of income you have to pay tax on. So, interest on student loans, IRA contributions, self-employed health insurance premiums, and HSA contributions - all are write-offs or deductible from gross income. The items I just mentioned are better write-offs than, say, charitable contributions or home-mortgage interest deduction because it only makes sense to write off the latter two if your itemized deductions goes over a certain amount.

About 5 months ago I was staying in Chicago for a few weeks. My friend, "Amy," came and visited me during a weekend. While she was here, she said she had plans to meet up with a man she used to work with in LA, but he now works in Chicago. They had been talking/texting/emailing a bit, and since she broke up with her boyfriend of 5 years, he was the first person she's been interested in. "Kevin" meets up with us one night, and we all get along great. I'm a little shy at first, since they both know each other quite well, but we end up engaging in several interesting discussions. I realize my friend may have feelings for him, so I'm doing my best to be completely neutral, flatter her, and still seem social. Kevin and Amy are even holding hands at one point. It was adorable. On the walk back towards my apartment, we're all chatting and I say some sort of joke, and he simply says a genuine, "you're really cool." It was nice. I go into my apartment and Amy stays outside and helps Kevin find a cab home. She comes back and I tell her that he is so interesting and pleasant, I understand where she's coming from. The next couple of days, Amy tries to contact him to meet up, but he is being wishy-washy, so she and I end up spending more time together and everything is fine. She's an awesome person. She makes a Twitter account while in Chicago, and weirdly enough, he follows her, follows me, then unfollows her. I didn't really understand it, but that was that. He would occasionally reply to a tweet of mine, but again, I didn't think too much of it, and would let Amy know. I move back home to Boston, and continue living my life here, without giving much thought to the whole Amy/Kevin situation, apart from some words of wisdom for when Amy is feeling down about getting over him. A couple of months ago, I'm on facebook. I normally have my account deactivated, but was online doing some creeping with a friend. In the 10 minutes I was on facebook before deactivating again, Kevin sends me a friend request. I thought it was quite the coincidence, deactivated, then sent him a twitter message, saying I'm normally not on facebook but I hope he's been well. We have a pleasant back and forth on twitter, during which I decide, why not, I'll just send him my phone number since I was enjoying talking to him. Amy hadn't talked about him all summer, and I think he's a person I would love to get to know. So we begin having conversations via text incredibly frequently. We have an incredible amount in common, and talking to him comes very easily. After this was occurring for a few weeks, I get a message from Amy about Kevin, saying she saw a status update and freaked out, realizing she wasn't over him. I decide to test the waters a little, and tell her that he sometimes to replies to things I tweet, and ask if she still wants to know of these types of things. She responds with an enthusiastic yes, so I tell her the truth, that I've actually been communicating with Kevin a lot, and there's a good chance we're interested in each other (at this point, he had discussed me meeting his parents and taking me to his hometown, which was a little strange but sweet). She isn't very happy, and we haven't talked since. This past weekend, Kevin and I were texting, and as our conversations have been during the past few weeks, the vibe gets quite sexual. I initially expressed some discomfort, but I've begun to think it's pretty fun and addictive. At one point, I decide to bring up our difference in age (mostly because he often states that he's old). He said something along the lines of "if you fuck good, nothing else matters." I get a bit offended, tell him I'm not an object, he asks if it makes him creepy for talking about sex so much, and I say no. The next day, I send him a pretty lengthy email where I discuss various events of sexual assault and situations where I never fully trust men, all culminating with me declaring that I've never actually had sex. And there was no real question posed at the end of the email. I just said I would get it if he can't really understand where I'm coming from. He responded with clarifying a few things, but said he'd get back to me when he has time to thoughtfully respond. I told him to take his time. The next day, I get a text from Amy, who I haven't talked to since telling her about Kevin and I, and she asks if there's something I would like to say to her. Kevin was in LA last week for work, and I had an inkling that he met up with Amy, but I never asked and he didn't mention anything apart from work stuff. I told her that I'd give her a call, but even I don't understand what's going on, especially since I'm still waiting on Kevin to think things over. We're planning on talking sometime this weekend. My question to you all is, am I in the wrong? Amy and Kevin were interested in each other, he didn't exactly reciprocate when she was in Chicago, and then I spend an evening with the both of them and this whole situation came to be. When he and I first started texting, it was a friendly vibe, and I wasn't trying to necessarily attract him, mostly because of fact that I didn't know what him and Amy were, and I was in Boston and he was in Chicago-none of it made a lot of sense. When I talk to Amy, how much should I disclose? Does it make sense to assume that they saw each other when he was in LA, or that they still remain in contact, despite the fact that she stated that they don't talk at all anymore when I spoke to her last? And does "pursuing" a relationship with him even make sense? We're far away, I'm focusing on starting my career which may take me to Chicago, but sometimes conversing with him takes hours at a time, and I can't balance handling feelings and focusing on work. Also, since this is kind of a long distance talking relationship, does that even make it worth it? He is incredible, in so many ways. As I'm getting to know him, I don't dislike a single thing about him. But I realize that spending actual time together in person could be completely different than what it has been. I am leaning towards putting the whole thing on a "pause" until a real relationship seems possible. Planning imaginary dates doesn't really mean anything. TL;DR
In Amy’s case, she had plans to meet with a man she worked with in Los Angeles, but now she works in Chicago. They had been talking/sexing/emailing a little bit, and since she broke up with her 5-year-old boyfriend, he was the first person she was interested in. “Kevin” meets us one night, and we all get along very well. I’m a little shy at first, as they both know each other very well, but we ended up engaging in several interesting discussions. I realize that my friend can have feelings for him, so I’m doing the best I can to be completely neutral, flattering her, and still seem social. Kevin and Amy even cling to one point. I was adorable. On the way back to my apartment, but she understands a lot about what makes Chicago people do, I realize that much more than she knows.
Not 100% sure what the etiquette is here. I'm having people over for birthday drinks on the weekend, one of them will be one of my good mates who I have known since high school. We have a sexual history, though I have no romantic feelings for him - when we had sex it was nothing more than sex. Thing is he's kind of a touchy feely guy, he likes to give big hugs. That's just his thing, always has been. So, I don't know if I should mention our history to my SO. Would it just cause awkwardness or what? TL;DR

In light of time travel coming out as "impossible", I propose a little thinking challenge to reddit: Rules: You can't change the timeline before or after your time of departure from your own time in any meaningful way until you return to the moment you left and are then wealthy. The moment you leave your time and return to your time must be +/- 24 hours. You may stay in the past as long as you need but cannot alter the timeline. Scenario would be this: You use your time machine to go back in time and do something, and then return to (as close as possible to) the moment you left. The thing you have done in the past has made you very wealthy, which then allows you to live whatever life you want going forward from that point. What could you do that would create the least (or no) butterfly effect? Some personal theories: Buy a modest amount of stock in companies of known future performance, but not enough to effect the current price or availability of shares on the day you purchase them in the past. Return to the present, sell the shares, pay the taxes, and continue on your merry way. You could buy $1 worth of 10,000 companies, or if you thought it wouldn't have a noticeable effect more of fewer companies. Grab an artifact from a recent discovery (recent to your departure time) and bring it back to the present. Sell it. This would slightly effect the timeline before you, but could minimize the damages. This could also be seen as fraudulent due to carbon dating. The rules would prevent you from going into the future and grabbing a future item to bring back and 'invent' because you could create a paradox in which the thing you took does not exist. We're looking for the least impact on the timeline and then only when you return to your time can it change or fork. Let's discuss, and then poke holes, in these theories. Go go go! edit: TL;DR
I'm done with this situation, you can still type messages in game while lagging you didn't leave mumble until the game ended, so there was definitely time to tell us what was happening to you.

I guess this is a personal subject, a pattern I've noticed before. I'm interested in a guy, I think it's attractive/nice, and I want to talk to him, we talk, I know him, blah, blah, and the moment he starts to show interest, I stop feeling interested, just a bad habit. I also put the kids away, the moment they start to approach, that's when it's over. I see him, like, "Hey, yeah, I want your attention. I'd love to have him, and I'd love to know that you want to meet me, bc I want to meet you. But I don't want to show interest, because it will scare me a lot. It's really weird, because I crave that attention from guys I like, and when I get it, I'll be like, "fuck, I don't want this."
My boyfriend (M22) and I (F24) are a weird situation where because we were good single friends, we ended up being roommates in a 4 bedroom house. Two months after moving in, we went out together. We've been dating for about 4 months. So far, it's been great and we haven't had a lot of problems except: Even before we started dating, he always invited me to any event with "the guys." I've been friends with all his friends for a while and I love hanging out with everyone. Recently, however, I found out that once a week, he wants to go out and get drunk with all... without me. I get that people sometimes need space and want to go out alone, but I really considered these people OUR friends.
Summariz: My boyfriend (M22) and I (F24) are a strange situation in which, because we were good friends while we were singles, we ended up being roommates in a 4 bedroom house. Two months after we moved out, we were dating. We have been dating for about 4 months. So far, this has been really great and we haven't had much trouble except: Even before we started dating, I always invited myself to any event with "the guys." I've been friends with all of his friends for a while and I like to go out with all of them. Recently, though, I've noticed that once a week, he wants to have a good time and get drunk with all of them... without me. I have that people need space sometimes and I want to go out on their own, but I really consider these people NUESTROS amigos. I'm jealous to know that he's out having a good time while I'm at home, he doesn't invite me to join.
My boyfriend is 26, I'm 24F, been together for 3 years and living together for almost the same time. On to the heart of the matter: I think my boyfriend's mom is kind of clingy and intrusive, and when I try to speak to him about it, his response is pretty much "I know she's clingy and intrusive, but you're an asshole for not turning a blind eye like I do". He accuses me of not wanting them to have a relationship because I don't like her. I admit that I don't like her (she jumped to conclusions and called me a bitch, and when confronted about it she switched the story around to make it seem like she was talking about someone else and I misunderstood, and she plays the victim now) but that's neither here nor there. I don't mind if she visits her son at our home, I don't mind them hanging out together. I'm always courteous to her. My issues are: Her dropping her in at 11 p.m. and beyond, dropping in without calling first, and wanting to party with us and our friends. Whenever she intrudes, she makes sure to bring along food or a gift for my boyfriend so that way I'm doubly an asshole for complaining about her just wanting to do something nice for her "baby boy" (by the way, my boyfriend has a younger brother that she NEVER refers to as anything other than his name). My boyfriend doesn't like the partying thing either, but he's too chicken to say anything. All he ever does is farm excuse after excuse to avoid talking to her about ANYTHING. He says he has talked to her about it and she won't change, but he never enforces anything. She keeps doing it because she knows he won't ever hold her to anything. He hardly ever acknowledges my complaints without a "but" attached, in which he shifts all blame on to me and paints me as a cruel jealous bitch that wants him to curse out his mom. I don't expect him to be mean or disrespectful to his mom or cut her out of his life, and I don't understand why he can't/won't talk to her adult to adult. She and my bf used to have a very strained relationship, which they've managed to reverse in the last year and a half or so. I really am happy for them, but I feel like they are both going overboard now. As I said before, my bf has a brother that she leaves completely alone. It's clear my bf is her favorite, and I know he secretly relishes this, as his brother was heavily favored by the rest of the family when he was younger. But I feel like they've gone from one unhealthy extreme to the other. I am going to try one last time to talk to him about this. What do you think, r/relationships? Am I really just not understanding enough? Any suggestions for how I should go about talking to him? TL;DR
I don't know why she needs me, but I don't know why she needs me. I don't know why she doesn't need her. I don't know why she needs her. I don't know why she needs her. I don't know why she doesn't need her. I don't know why she doesn't need her. I don't know why she needs her. I don't know why she doesn't need her. I don't know why she needs her.

My friend is always 26, I'm 24F, stay together for 3 years and live together for almost the same time. On the heart of the matter: I think my girlfriend is a kind of clingy and intrusive, and when I try to talk to him about it, his answer is pretty "I know she's ringing and intrusive, but you're an asshole because not a blind eye like me." He accused me that they don't want to have a relationship because I don't like her. I admit that I don't have any here or there. I don't know if she comes to a conclusion and called me a bitch, and when she faced about it, she turned around the story to make it as they talked about someone else and I misunderstood, and she's playing the victim now) but that's neither here nor there. I don't know if she's a friend to talk about that I'm not younger.
Sumar: My boyfriend is 26 years old, I am 24F, I have been together for 3 years and living together at almost the same time. At the bottom of the matter, I think my boyfriend's mom is a little sticky and intrusive, and when I try to talk to him about it, his answer is pretty "I know she's sticky and intrusive, but you're an idiot for not turning a blind eye like me." He accuses me of not wanting to have a relationship because I don't like her. I admit I don't like her. (She jumped to conclusions and called me a bitch, and when she confronted her changed the story to make it look like she was talking about someone else and I didn't understand my victim now) but that's neither here nor there. I don't care if she visits her son at home, I don't care if she stays with her friend to make friends with him because she always tells her friend and she does it to her friend.
He has good points, i was going to quote some parts of it but his whole comment is good. >I hate to burst your bubble, but this isn't as big as you think. They already streamed TI4 via ESPN 3. They aren't giving us a shot. They have nothing to lose by streaming Worlds on ESPN 3 because most people aren't even aware it exists. They just wanted attention. They don't care about eSports. They don't care about its development. BTW, they had an International 4 preview show ACTUALLY ON TV. It was on ESPN. The real channel. They aren't even giving us that. TL;DR

Semblance Theory Q. Are semblances developed based on the user's personality? And if so, could semblances change over time? I was thinking about how each character's semblance seemed to represent aspects of their respective characters. But they were all reflections of their personalities after they had been relatively developed. What I mean is that semblances seem to only develop after a person's aura is unlocked. (Case in point: Jaune) Depending on when in their lifetime their aura is unlocked, a person's respective semblance can differ. For example: Characters with semblances developed prior to enrolling in Beacon (pretty much everyone, but this is important) Ruby has speed, a reflection of her eagerness and haste to do things. Rushes headlong into trouble; acts first, thinks later; Weiss uses Glyphs patterned with the Schnee family crest. Indicative of her pride in her family name. Blake's shadows are mentioned by her in the show - useful for running away, which she probably did a lot of prior to Beacon. Yang's semblance took some figuring, but with her nature as a thrill-seeker, she seems to relish the actual fighting more than winning. As a result, her semblance takes into account that she would be trading blows with her opponent and powers her up accordingly for the upper hand. Along the lines of "Good fight, but I'm going home with the belt." That's the kind of feeling I get from Yang. Pyrrha's Polarity. This took some figuring, might be a bit of a stretch, but think of what magnets do. They attract and repel. Kinda like Pyrrah's life up until Beacon right? As she said at the dance, she attracts people with her talent, but at the same time repels them. What does is all this important? Well, if semblances are more or less Personality Powers, could a semblance change/evolve in accordance with a change in the user's personality? Kinda like Patronuses in the World of Harry Potter, which change due to great emotional change. If Blake no longer feels like she has the need to run; if Weiss no longer feels tied to her family; if Pyrrah finally feels at ease surrounded by the bonds she has made, would the semblance change to reflect that? TL;DR
Similar Theory Q. Is there any likeness developed on the basis of the personality of the user? And if that is the case, can the similarities change over time? I was thinking of how each character likeness seemed to represent aspects of their respective characters. But they were all reflections of their personalities after they were relatively developed. What I mean is that the similarities only develop after a person's aura is unlocked. (Case in point: Yellow) Depending on their lives, they are unlocked, a person's likeness may differ. For example: Characters with similar features developed before registering with Beacon (almost everyone, but it's important) Ruby has speed, a reflection of his passion and hasten to do things.
Any suggestions for a pale girl wanting to highlight? I'm typically the lightest shade, or maybe second lightest shade, of foundation. I have been using Laura Gellars duo higher, but ran out of the pale matte side about 3x faster than the shimmer. TL;DR

As others have already said, "it depends." What examiners are going to look for is your ability to navigate the airplane in a worst case situation. I normally plan the route on paper along with WCA's anyways especially (as was the case on a XC to FFA last year) if my GPS isn't working right. That being said, forecasts are always forecasts, and the information you use to calculate your WCA will probably be off at the very least a few degrees. So dead reckoning and visual references will be best. Of course this all changes for IFR flights, as there are more regulations on required equipment. TL;DR
All I wanted to do was get going with an extraordinarily simple task, UV Mapping a cube. A simple cube. [Following this video recommended to me by a friend]( I understand what needs to be done, but I'm fighting with this interface to find the options that the person in the video used shortcuts to do. I can open the UV Editing window, put it into Cycles Render, put it in Edit Mode, but I can't find the Mesh Select Mode so that I can select the edges. Been at this for an hour, and I know that if this is an extremely easy task, then I need to practice some tutorials specifically on how this UI works. I don't want to harp on it too much, but it does feel entirely alien to every program I have ever used. Like Bizarro superman programmed this UI, or it was formed from the congealed thoughts of the slumbering Old Gods. TL;DR

There's a guy I've worked with for about a year who I'm really attracted to, probably because we spend a lot of time together, he's incredibly smart, our interests are closely aligned, and my own long-term relationship was down the drain (officially over as of two days ago, but not the reason I'm here). I went on a work trip with said coworker a week ago, during which time we talked about (a) we both are attracted to each other (b) nothing could ever happen for us to act on those feelings because that's crazy because we don't know each other and were both in relationships and (c) we hugged for a long time. Nothing happened after that. We went out to coffee during work hours a few times after we got back and talked through how we're both in weird situations, and the feelings we have probably aren't about us, but about our uncertainty about the relationships we were in. We decided to keep our distance. This was all decided within a few days. It probably could have been fine and faded away, but (props to him), he spilled the beans about it to his girlfriend of 7 years and she is now demanding I meet face-to-face to apologize. What do I do? My first reaction is that it's not going to bring any good. But if it's what it takes to make her feel better and make his relationship right, I'm of course going to do it. I don't really know what to apologize for, though. I can't apologize for being attracted. I can probably apologize for telling him about it. I think she should respect the fact that he didn't act on any feelings he expressed. Do I apologize for hugging him? I just feel really awkward about the whole thing. Advice please. TL;DR
I didn't apologize for him. There's a guy I've worked with, for about a year I'm really attracted to, probably because we spend a lot of time together, he's incredibly smart, our interests are closely tuned, and my own long-term relationship was down in the drain (officially over two days, but not the reason why I'm here). I went on a work trip with this employee a week ago, during which we're both attracted to each other (a) nothing could ever happen for us to act on these feelings because that's crazy because we don't know each other and were both in relationships and (c) we hugged for a long time. Nothing happened afterwards. We went to coffee during working hours a few times after we've been back and talked about how we both are in strange situations, and the feelings we're probably not about ourselves, but about our uncertainty about the relationships we were in. We decided to keep our distance when all within a few days. It might have done well to do it, that he's not apologize.
I feel so sad with the stories of Corgis being nuts. My family owned a beautifully friendly Corgi. His worst problem was herding the gamers that visited our house every Saturday. He'd run about when they split off into small groups and try to herd them back into the larger group, usually by tugging on pant legs. He never damaged clothing or people. Hell, he'd do ANYTHING for cheese, so even clipping his nails was quick and easy. We established who he could and could not rough-house with, and Mama (me) was NOT one of them. Once that was understood, everything worked great. He was pretty much bomb proof; nothing really surprised or bothered him. Then again, all of our animals were raised to be that way. Our home and family are VERY active and busy, with many friends coming and going for games and meals and whatnot. All of my animals grew up in that kind of environment. TL;DR

Have you ever had the feeling where you're not sure which sub you should post something to because it's a picture taken from one show but the reference is from another, but you've had a few drinks and you're not sure whether to post it to one, both, or neither, and you're wondering what in the name of God someone is shouting about like that for outside your apartment, but you realize you're rambling and just making one giant run on sentence that could easily be fixed by just adding a few periods and capitalizing some letters.

If you're not allergic to grasses, it shouldn't be too bad. There are so many more grasses here (it is a prairie, you know) that my allergies are much worse than in the northeast, even with fewer trees and virtually no mold. I also agree with the person who mentioned the forest fires... that'll do a number on your respiratory system. You may also have trouble with the smog, aka "[the brown cloud]( even though it's much better than it used to be. TL;DR
I don't really expect it TBH. One simple reason: Legacy =/= Pre-EoC Its just a huge waste of development time IMO. The majority of players who quit because of EoC, moved away, playing other games, and won't come back for a cheap copy. Maybe a few form OSRS, but when they realize that Legacy is totaly not Pre-EoC, they will quit. I bet It will be dead content within 1 month. Why can't Jagex just do 1 combat styles? As I've seen, Legacy is just momentum, with scaled down damages. Nothing special. And every new comat content will double work for Jagex, they have to balance the 2 combat all the time. Wich is impossible. One will be better . (more efficient) Now we have more info on Legacy, Jagex should re-poll it. And not free to play poll. Im curious what the current players think about Legacy, since it will affect our game. TL;DR

If we really care about sedentary problems, we should start reading it in the fourth paragraph. The first thing to take into account is that this is not a problem limited to the period 1998-2002. Origins were traced back to the Second World War, but we leave aside excruciating details, the fact is that the Argentine economy after the Second World War was heavily conditioned by inflation. From 1945, inflation would reach peaks of up to 113 per cent per year, with an average of 25 per cent between 1945 and 1971, and up to 60 per cent of the following years. This situation was, of course, aggravated by military dictatorships, in addition to the 1980 economic crisis, as well as the Falkland War.

"orange". then i would show her a yellow cup and ask her what color it was. "yellow". i would then pour the orange juice into the cup and "WALAH" they were the same color! my mom fell for that trick every time. TL;DR

I'm not saying the news is wrong, but many people aren't getting it the right way. Italy isn't in any way legalizing cannabis, it has already been tried and failed. This is just a differentiation made between more and "less" dangerous substances (like the difference there could be between theft and murder). Unfortunately, Italy isn't organized enough in order to get Marijuana legal, because the government would be able to handle the illegal traffics (which are already very much present) TL;DR
So, what the INDIVIDUALS did is illegal (at least in the US) and they can be prosecuted under Rule 9(a)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 for fines up to treble damages and/or jail time. Since most of this was done over IM it should be an easy case (the state in which any trade occurred can actually levy charges, too). The broker-dealer (bank) has the potential to be fined and have it's registration revoked or suspended. The sponsoring broker-dealer effectively has a responsibility to have (paraphrasing) rules, controls and systems in place to prevent market manipulation and insider trader. Basically, this means training, computer controls, overview of emails and IM's on a regular basis, and oversight by a designated "principal" within the organization (who needs additional Series certifications). All these layers protect the broker-dealer where they can say "hey, this is limited to a couple bad apples, we didn't condone, or have knowledge, of this at all. We probably didn't have enough controls in place, so look, we'll pay a big fine to disgorge profits, and promise to do a better job next time." If they can prove this, they are limited to paying fines up to the profits made plus interest less income made by the counterparty. Now this makes sense for a number of reasons (would you close FedEx for one employee who kept stealing packages) but a big one is that this allows the SEC to at least get a fine and make some headlines. Since the standard of control is basically a best efforts basis, it's better than 1.) shutting down an important company and 2.) avoid losing and potentially getting nothing (the federal government doesn't like to go to court if its not certain they will win). TL;DR
So what INDIVIDUALS have done is illegal (at least in the United States) and they can be prosecuted under Rule 9(a)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 for fines up to triple the damage and/or the time of imprisonment. Since most of this has been done on IM, it should be an easy case (the state in which any trade can actually collect fees, too). The broker/distributor (bank) has the potential to be convicted and has its registration revoked or suspended. The sponsor/distributor has indeed the responsibility to have (paraphrase) rules, controls and systems in place to prevent market manipulation and internal traders.
So what the INDIVIDUALS are doing is illegal (at least in the U.S.) and they can be prosecuted under Rule 9(a)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act from 1934 for fines up to triple damages and/or prison time. As most of them have been done via IM, it should be a simple case (the state in which each trade occurred can actually charge), too. The broker dealer (bank) has the potential to receive fines and to withdraw or suspend registration. The sponsor broker dealer has the effective responsibility (paraphrasing) to have rules, controls and systems on site to prevent market manipulation and insider traders. Basically, this means training, computer controls, overview of emails and IM's on a regular basis, and supervision by a certain "principal" within the organization (who needs additional series certifications).
Therefore, what INDIVIDUALS did is illegal (at least in the U.S.) and can be prosecuted under Rule 9(a)(2) of the 1934 Stock Exchange Act for fines up to triple damages and/or jail time.

Basically, this means training, computer controls, general view of emails and IM's on a regular basis, and supervision by a designated "main" within the organization (which needs additional Series certifications).All these layers protect the agent-dependent, where they can say "hey, this is limited to this case, we do not condone, or we have nothing else to gain a benefit.
so yesterday i had made plans to go see my girlfriend who lives 2 hours away and that i had been dating for 8months. our relationship has been going really well up until now. Friday arvo i asked her if she still wanted me to come to see her at her home 2 hours away in which she replied "yeah if you want to but if you cant im not bothered x" followed by " actually No, i dont want you to watch me play cos il play bad" so i said ok dont worry about it i wont come then. this made me feel as that she didnt want me to come when i havent seen her in a week and a half. later that night she messaged me saying that i should of come and asking if i could come now. not having anything to do that night i made plans with my sister and told her that i couldn't come. she then instantly got pissed of at me and got really angry with me. she then got taling about how we are different and then sent these messages: her - 'i still think what its like to be with other guys! and that doesn't mean i dont love you but its still there. all the time in the back of my head. and i still fell the same way as i did about (another guy) at the start of our relationship! i always think about it!" then i asked "you feel the same way about me as (another guy)? which she replied with "i dont know what i want! i dont want to loose you but i want to do other things!" then i said " well you cant have both, what do you mean by other things" then she said "Well i just want to see what its like being with some one elset to feel what its like to be single and do what i want. i dont want to loose you tho" then i said "no but right now your saying you want to break up and how am i ment to feel when i dont want to!" which se replied with "i dont want to break up i just, idunno... i still want to be with you but i want to be able to see what its like" this has been stuck in my head for days and i cant help thinking about her with another guy. did she say this because we where fighting and she was losing the argument or does she really mean it?? over the last day and a bit she hasn't been acting her self while she is messaging me eg not replying or replying very bluntly but it has got better today. is it just because shes still pissed or is she sick of this relationship where as a week ago the thought of cheating on me to her made her cry. sorry if this doesn't make much sense but i had to ask theres so many thoughts going through my head about my girlfriend who im in love with please help reddit!! TL;DR
I asked her if she still wanted me to come to her house. It gave me the impression that she didn't want me to come when I saw her in a week and a half. Later that night, she sent me a message saying that I should come and ask if I could come now.
I don't want you to want that "I don't want you to "I don't want you to "I don't want you to "I don't want you to "I don't want you to "I don't want you to "I don't want you to "I don't want you to see that you't if you don't want, but if you don't want me to come, if I don't see you in a week and a half. Later that she really mad at me said that I should come and ask if I'm coming now. nothing to do that I have plans with my sister and told her that I didn't want me to come. she then immediately pissed at me and got really angry at me. she then likes me to say that we're different and then this news: I have nothing to do that I want her to still want that I don't want her to want that I want other guys that I don't like again.
Summariz: so yesterday I had made plans to go see my girlfriend who lives 2 hours away and who had been dating for 8 months. our relationship has been going very well so far. Friday Arvo asked her if she still wanted me to come and see her at home 2 hours away where she answered "yes if you want, but if I can't disturb x" followed by "actually no, I don't want you to see me play because play bad" so I said ok don't worry about this I won't come then. this made me feel like I didn't want to come and see when I haven't seen her in a week and a half. later that night she told me that I should come and she asked me what I could say now. I have nothing to do with my sister and I told her that I couldn't go see what I couldn't see and then she told me that I care and told me what I want to do.
I've noticed a lot more extreme undercutting lately, and some of it confuses me. If you're posting something in the Limsa market, don't undercut someone posting in a different market. Price match that person. Chances are, there are people from all three factions that need what you're selling. Do them and yourself a favor and price match different factions and undercut your own. Example: If I see someone selling a high priced item (Ironworks gear) in the Limsa market, I'll swap the same item to a retainer in the Gridania market and price match that person. That way if someone from either faction wants that item, they don't have to be brought up in price because of the "taxes" in this game. This may not be a lot of people's favorite idea, since most like to sell quickly vs for max profit, but it helps keep the server economy in good shape. Someone will buy the cheaper, which isn't necessarily going to be the lowest on the Market board for that person. I usually buy from Limsa sellers since I'm in Maelstrom and it tends to be cheaper than lowers after fees. TL;DR
If you publish something on the Limsa market, don't undercut someone who posts in another market. The price corresponds to that person. The odds are, there are people of the three factions who need what you sell. Do them and yourself a favor and the price correspond to different factions and undercut your own. Example: If I see someone selling a high-priced item (factory equipment) in the Limsa market, I will trade the same item to a maintenance agent on the Gridania market and the price correspond to that person. That way, if one of the factions wants this item, they don't have to be high in price because of the "taxes" in this game. This may not be a lot of people's favorite idea, because most like to sell fast vs. for maximum profit, but it helps keep the server economy in good shape. Someone will buy the cheapest, which will not necessarily be the lowest on the market for that person.
In  TL;DR  I've noticed a much more extreme undercutting lately, and some of it confuses me. If you post something on the Limsa market, don't undercut someone who posts in another market. Price corresponds to that person. Probably there are people from all three factions who need what you're selling. Do them and get a favor and price match different fractions and undercut your own. Example: If I see someone selling a high-price article (iron equipment) on the Limsa market, I'll swap the same element to a retainer in the Gridania market and price match that person. In this way, if anyone from both faction wants items, they don't have to be raised in price because of the "taxes" in this game. This can't be a lot of people favorite idea, since most like to sell quickly vs for max profit, but it helps keep the server economy in good form.
I have noticed much more extreme undercutting lately, and some of them confuse me. If you are posting something on the Limsa market, do not undercut someone who publishes on a different market. Match the price than that person. There are odds, there are people from the three factions who need what you are selling. Do yourself a favor and price match different factions and undercut your own. Example: If I see someone selling a high priced item (iron equipment) on the Limsa market, I will change the same item to a retainer on the Gridania market and the price match that person. That way if anyone from any of the factions wants that item, they do not have to be brought in the price due to the "taxes" in this game. This is not necessarily a great favorite idea of people, as more like selling quickly vs for maximum benefit, but it helps keep the server economy in good shape. Someone will buy the cheapest, which will not necessarily be the lowest on the market board for that person.
Am I going to have a crappy career if I dont start networking and getting connections for my next job position? This is a goal oriented question. What kind of position would you like to be in in 10 years? >why do they even bother posting positions online if it's all about networking?!?!? Some places are required to post positions by law. Others do it to avoid an appearance of favoritism. Some do it because ... that's what you do. Some don't bother posting at all and just ask people within the company to send potential candidates in. >And how do you even get a job though 'connections' ..... isnt it rude to just announce to everyone you meet that you are looking for a job or to advance up into a higher position? I often see this in LinkedIn or Facebook. Someone will post something like, "Just lost my job today, please send any potential positions my way!" No, that's not rude. >Like are you supposed to just say "hey random person that I just met....I am looking for a new position, here is my card, please consider me if you happen to hear of an opening in your company. I think the breakdown here is a lack of understanding in what networking is. Networking professionally is basically making friends in the industry outside of your place of work. This doesn't need to be people in your specific job, other useful people to have in your network might be people on boards, people who run companies, etc. Volunteering is one way to build your network, yes. Another way is to attend meetups or other activities that don't involve volunteering. Attending conferences is yet another great way to make friends in your industry, especially if you'd like to relocate at some point. So this network you keep referring to is now a group of people who you consider friends, or at least colleagues. How does friendship work? Friends do each other favors. Why do friends do each other favors? BECAUSE IT MAKES THEM FEEL GOOD. Seriously, especially in your industry. People get a giant thrill being able to help out a friend in need, and doing this actually makes people feel closer. >My goal in life is to eventually become some sort of consultant within my field because they are well paid enough to be able to set their own schedules and work less than a 40 hour week if they want to. Have you asked yourself how consultants find work? You don't just set up shop and let people come to you, you have to have a solid network from which to draw on until you build up a solid reputation as a company. With an industry like marketing, it's going to be very easy to get pigeonholed into whatever business you happened to get your first job in. Ok, so let's say the company you currently work for makes widgets. You've done your job well, and progressed as far as you're going to within that company. You feel like it's time to move on into something new, because you've gotten bored/hate your boss/feel underappreciated/the company is downsizing/the company went under. You go out and look for positions using whatever it is you use to find this work - let's say craigslist. You apply at an online publication. They've never heard of the company you work for now, so they're not interested. You apply at a museum. They say you don't understand the industry, but are happy to offer you a junior position with a pay cut. If you had applied THROUGH your network, you would have had a solid recommendation before even walking into that interview. You're pre-vetted, and already have a good reputation with the interviewer. Often jobs found through a network will even skip the interview process entirely. TL;DR
If I don't start working in a network and have connections for my next workstation, it's a goal-oriented question. What kind of position would you like to be in 10 years' time? >Why they even have to post online jobs if it's the week you're networking?!!? Some places are needed to post positions by law. Others do so to avoid an appearance of favouritism. Some do so because... that's what you do. Some do not bother you post at all and simply ask people in the company to send you potential candidates. >And how did you even get a job through "connections."... Isn't it rude to tell everyone that you're meeting that you're looking for a job or to move to a higher position? I often see this in LinkedIn or Facebook. Someone will publish something like, do my job here, please send potential jobs to me.
At first I thought I was a normal kid but then a parcel was delivered to my house. I did not know what type of parcel it could be because I did not order any parcels. By the way it was delivered by an Amazon drone which was euphoric because it droned the shit out of me. Then I opened the parcel and there was a fedora in it, a nice black fedora. I put it on my head and hoped my penis would grow but instead of the growth of my penis my autism was triggered. I have not been the same ever since. TL;DR
TL;DR  At first I thought I was a normal child, but then a package was delivered to my home. I didn't know what kind of package it could be because I didn't order any packages. By the way, it was delivered by an Amazon drone that was euphoric because it blew the shit out of me. Then I opened the package and there was a Fedora in it, a beautiful black Fedora. I put it on my head and hoped that my penis would grow, but instead of growing my penis my autism was triggered.
Summar: At first I thought it was a normal child but then a package was delivered to my house. I didn’t know what kind of package it could be because I didn’t ask for any package. Because of the way it was delivered by an Amazon drone that was euphoric because it drained my shit. Then I opened the package and there was a fedora in it, a nice black fedora. I put it in my head and expected my penis to grow but instead of my penis my autism triggered. I haven’t been the same since.

This is likely dated advice, but when I went to college 10 years ago the laundry machines in the residence used SmartCity cards. You would pay $50 to fully load the card up and each time you did laundry it would deduct the amount from that pre-paid card. Well at that time I was involved in programming the "HU Football" cards for DirectTV and this involved taking satellite smart cards and using a smart card reader/writer to program them for access to free satellite tv. I applied the same principle to the laundry card. Pay once to load laundry card. Use smart card reader / writer to make an image file of the fully loaded laundry card. Re-write the image back to the smart card when you run out. TL;DR
Recruiters are terrible to deal with. The one's I've dealt with anyway. Setting aside the harrassment issues (not sexual, just general haranging) they've lied to me so much to convince me to attend an interview. The last one told me about an opportunity for Magento Developer, which sounded good so I decided to go, when I got to the interview, they said, "So you know what job you're interviewing for?" and jokingly I said "No, I just saw your ad in the window and thought I'd pop in", Fortunately, this worked out in my favour as they missed the joke and said "ok, well it's a Head of Magento Team, where you'll be managing the team, all the projects, working with the sales team to deliver quotes and coming up with ideas for new and improvements for Magento modules". As much as I'd love to do that now, at the time I had no prior experience of leadership or project management and at the time I still wanted to stick to day-to-day development work. The recruiter had completely altered the job description to make it fit the skills on my CV (resume). I told the interviewer that I wasn't here for the position, but sounded interesting so I'd rather carry on the interview. I even got the callback but at the time I decided that I'd carry on day-to-day development. TL;DR
As a support main from s3, I kind of see what you're saying w/r/t the homogenization, but supports were plenty homogenized in the before times. The same dive/poke/sustain relationship existed, but I very much appreciate having a build path that isn't just sightstone, boots and all the wards . Though part of me does miss "all the wards"... Your anecdotal sample group is delightful but means nothing except that your support main friends are burning out, grew up on s2, or any number of other reasons. Especially if they've all been playing since s2. Unless you have 100,000 support main friends, then we can get some statistical rigor going. Conversely, I started playing mid late s3, because I got sick of being a ward bucket. Come season 4, support's actually fun to play. Thresh is still awesome, Leona is awesome, and thanks to frost queen changes my s3 plantlady Zyra is quite strong. The amount of available active items combined with all the gold supports are getting is quite nice, providing some build diversity- if I need to protect the Vayne, I can go mikhaels and twin shadows and peel like crazy. - If we get a strong lead i can build AP while still being able to afford a sightstone! TL;DR
As a main support of s3, I see in a way what you say w/r/t homogenization, but the supports have been much homogenized in the previous times. The same relationship dive/poke/sustain, but I really appreciate having a construction path that is not only the stone of sight, the boots and all the pupils. Although part of me misses "all the pupils"... Your anecdotal sample group is delicious but means nothing except that your main support friends are burning, have grown up on s2, or a number of other reasons. Especially if they have all played since s2. If you have 100,000 main supporters friends, then we can get some statistical rigour. Conversely, I started playing at the end of s3, because I'm tired of being a puppy bucket.
As support head of s3, I see what you say, w/r/t homogenization, but support was much homogenized in the earlier times. The same Dive/Poke/Sustain relationship existed, but I appreciate very much that a construction path that is not only sight stone, boots and all stations. Although a part of me miss "all the stations"... your anecdotal sample group is adorable, but nothing but that your support main friends burn, grew on s2 or a number of other reasons. Especially if they all play since s2. If you don't have 100,000 support main friends, then we can go some statistical strictness. Conversely, I started playing mid late s3, because I got sick, a station bucket. Come season 4, support is actually fun to play. Thresh is still awesome, Leona is brilliant, and thanks to Frost Queen changes my s3 plant Zyra is pretty strong.

First off, i'm sorry for the length... My story starts about a year ago. I was working ALOT and started having trouble with the wife. I was addicted to porn then and knew it, but didn't have the will power to work 16hr days and try to break the addiction. My wife had been slowly losing interest in me because I wasn't spending any time with her and when I did I was a cranky jerkass! So eventually the S hit the fan and my relationship with my best friend was in some serious jeopardy. We had some massive fights and I broke, because she was the most important thing in my life and she had damn near slipped away. I fell into a depression and hated life. I was angry at my wife for many things and i was so full of pride. I moved into a separate bedroom and been there ever since. Then things turned around. My uncle called me and spent time to teach me the ways of Jesus. I had been raised a christian, but I had not been raised to love others more than myself. I was christian by name and not by action. I'm trying to change that. So fast forward to a couple months ago where I find this reddit. I had been taking steps to improve myself and be more christ-like. I wanted to win my wife back and really show her that I loved her. I also wanted to break from my slavery to porn. As the bible says, you can't serve two masters. I started out doing about 2-3 days, then moved to a week. After that i've gone about 2-7 days in spurts and have really struggled. Every day is a struggle for me but this reddit has really helped encourage and push me on. I haven't met my goal of 2 weeks but I will!!! I had read all the stories about how nofap made single guys ask out the girl. Well, for me, it made me humble myself and ask to move back into the bedroom with my wife. Not to have sex, but to have her help keep me accountable at night. I only fap when i'm alone. I try to spend more time with her so that i'm not alone. All the anger and resentment I had from our fights has started slipping away and i've been able to start showing her the love that christ has shown me. well, today during my quite time I broke into tears. she came in and asked me what was wrong and I confessed for the first time that i have a bad addiction to porn. She knew i was trying to go without fapping, but I don't think she really understood why. Today I told her about the addiction that i'm under and that i am sorry for all the wrong i've done her. so, /r/nofap/ thank you. thank you for helping me come out about this addiction and thank you for helping me take steps to fix it. christian or not, thank you for helping me start to show the love my wife deserves. TL;DR
I didn't have time to work with her, but I had the power to work 4:00 and I tried to break the addiction. My wife had slowly lost interest in me because I didn't spend time with her and when I did I was a grumpy moron! So finally the S hit the fan and my relationship with my best friend was in a serious danger of reading. We had some massive fights and I broke, because she was the most important thing in my life and she had almost slipped away. I fell into a depression and hated life. I was angry with my wife for a lot of things and I was so proud of myself. I moved into a separate room and I was realizing that things turned into cleaning days.
I didn't have to be home to do this Christian and I really did red masters. I got my wife to move. My story started over a year. I worked ALOT and started having problems with the woman. I was addicted to porn then and knew it, but I didn't have the willpower to work 16 hours and try to break the addiction. My wife had slowly lost interest in me because I didn't spend time with her and when I was a crazy idiot! So I fell into a depression and hated life. I was mad at my wife for many things and I was so full of pride. I moved into a separate bedroom and was always since. Then things turned around. My uncle called me and spent time teaching me the ways of Jesus. I was a Christian educated, but I wasn't educated to love others.
I was working a lot and I started having problems with the wife. I was addicted to pornography then and I knew it, but I didn’t have the will power to work 16 hours days and try to break the addiction. My wife had been losing little by little interest in me because I wasn’t spending any time with her and when I was a rude idiot! So finally the S hit my fan and my relationship with my best friend was in serious danger. We had some massive fights and I broke up, because she was the most important thing in my life and she was close to getting away. I fell into a depression and hated life. I was angry with my wife for many things and I was so full of pride. I moved to a separate room and I was there ever since. Then things turned around. My uncle called me and spent time on earth to teach me to make more of the life I’ve done more of the faith.
I've been waiting to share this story since I joined Reddit. It's a bit of a novel but to this day my words and actions are checked because of this event. All having to do with an event that happened back in the 5th grade day... I had come home from school one day and overheard one of my friends using the word prostitute (I think it was a South Park episode that he had watched). So I, being the naive sheltered kid started using the word and soon enough it had become an integrated part of my vocab. I was at a golf camp that summer for kids ages 8-14. I was playing a match against my friends little 8 year old brother and when something would not go my way I would say "Wow... what a gay prostitute." I had called him a "gay prostitute" a bunch of times throughout the course of the round, not really thinking anything of it because hey, I had no idea what it meant and they were just words. Fast forward two days later... I'm in my room building the Imperial Tie Fighter lego kit and I hear my mom SCREAM my name from downstairs telling me to get downstairs immediately. The usage of the middle name was the dead giveaway that I was FUCKED, but I digress. I see both of my parents at the foot of the stairs and my Dad looks me dead in the eyes and says: "So you think you're a big tough guy huh?" I replied with a shaky "What?" to which he responded "Don't give me that 'What' shit" (my parents don't swear so this was a huge 'this is how I die' moment). My mom was crying and told me to get in the car. She told me she had received a call from my friends dad who told me the little brother had been brooding in his room since that day. His dad asked him what was wrong and he asked his dad what a "gay prostitute" was. They had to have a family meeting to discuss what had happened, decided to notify the golf course of the event, and notify my parents. We drove 4 minutes down the road to his house where his entire family were outside waiting for me. I have never been so sorry about anything in my whole life. Those two words had ruined his innocence. I cried in front of his whole family and my mom and begged them to forgive me. Which they did. I also got a call from the Head Pro saying she wanted to have a meeting with me and told me that her initial reaction was she wanted to bar me from playing in the rest of the camp but his family kindly said that was a little extreme. Looking back on this event it I know this 100% changed me and helped make me who I am today. I've bumped into them a couple of times since (no longer living by me) and I feel so awkward and awful many years later. I wish I could take those words back but younger me needed a reality intervention quick. TL;DR
I asked her family to tell me "what I had done" what I had told her family one day when I had heard one of my friends using the word prostitute (I think it was an episode of South Park that he had watched). So, being the naive kid started using the word and soon it became an integrated part of my vocabulary. I was in a golf camp this summer for children aged 8 to 14 years. I was playing a game against my 8-year-old boyfriends and when something didn't want to go my way I would say "Wow... what a gay prostitute" I told her a "gay prostitute" a lot of times she got her parents' names all round the round, not really thinking that my mom was dead because hey, I had no idea what it was and they were just words.
I've been waiting to share this story since I Reddit. It's a bit of a novel, but until that day my words and actions were reviewed because of this event. Everything that happened to do with an event that happened in the 5th grade day... I had come home from school one day and heard one of my friends using the word prostitute (I think it was a South Park episode he had observed). So when the naive protected child started with the word and soon enough, it had become an integrated part of my vocabulary. I was at a golf camp this summer for children aged 8-14 years. I played a game against my friends who I had no idea what it meant and they were just words. Quickly after two days... I had called him a "gay prostitute" I had a number of times in the round to hear that my name was Mother SCREA.
I've been meeting my family and I've been waiting to share this story since I joined Reddit. It's a little bit of a novel, but until today my words and actions are checked because of this event. They all have to do with an event that happened on the fifth grade day... I had come home from school one day and I heard one of my friends using the word whore. (I think it was an episode of South Park that he had seen. So, being the naive child protected he started using the word and soon enough he had become an integrated part of my vocabulary. I was on a golf course that summer for kids from 8 to 14 years.

I remember reading a few posts either here or elsewhere about an initial PCOS diagnosis that turned out to be adrenal insufficiency. For those that have had this issue, what were your main symptoms? How did the diagnosis end up being changed? My bloodwork showed low cortisol and low ACTH and a few other factors that are in line with SAI, but the doctor stuck with PCOS and wouldn't say what about the bloodwork ruled out SAI. Obviously I need a second opinion here, but I went through so much crap just getting my hormone levels checked to begin with between different doctors that I'm curious about any tricks to get taken seriously enough to get either treatment or a referral (for the hormone issues that ended up being not shaving for 2 weeks before the appointment and saying "Here's my problem" - I'd told multiple doctors my symptoms and it wasn't until providing a visual that bloodwork was immediately ordered). I'm going into the 3rd year of TTC with nothing but a long list of what didn't work to show for it and don't want to spend any extra time with what might be an incorrect diagnosis than I have to.

Players could post their name to the stake billboard. Then other players could bet for them. So gigabyte is a maxed main. He's broke but he enjoys the thrill of staking. He could post his name. Then terabyte notices gigabytes stats and decides to put some faith in him. Terabyte bids 500k toward gigabytes next stake. Terabyte has to have 500k in his coffers. Once he bids that cash on gigabyte, the cash enters the bid pool. Gigabyte can then find a person to stake. In the duel options window, he will be able to offer his own money and money from the bid pool to stake. Once any gp from the pool is offered, the accept option will be locked until the opponent bets equally or greater as the pooled cash that gigabyte has posted. There should be a viewing orb by the coffers. When terabyte wants to check the progress of gigabytes duel, he can click the viewing orb and see exactly what gigabyte sees. This would only work with gp. Stakers that throw fights to friends would be at risk of penalty. Penalty being no longer having access to staking for others. Reports would be reviewed and enforced by a crack team of investigators hired by jagex. TL;DR

Then Terabyte notices gigabytes statistics and decides to put some confidence in him. Terabyte offers 500k in the direction of gigabytes next bet. Terabyte has 500k in his cash drawers. Once he offers that cash on gigabytes, the cash enters into the bid pool. Gigabytes can then bet a person. In the duel options window, he should be able to bet his own money and money from the bid pool. Once each gp is offered from the pool, the assumption option will be locked until the opponent bets equal or greater than the pooled cash that Gigabyte has released. It should be a viewing orb from the coffers. If Terabyte wants to bet out of the pool, the acceptance option will be suspended until the opponent will see what is or by the pooled cash.

I haven't read those links and I'm not going to. I have known plenty of people that have changed their lives through NA/AA. It doesn't matter why it works, or even if it shouldn't work. Psychology is super complex and super simple at the same time. In giving a person that has lost hope a community of peers, a support system, and a process that leads to freedom, I'd bet the actual science of the process it is far less important than the rest of the program. Just having peers to answer to and a phone number to call even at 3am is an amazing thing when you feel weak. Recognition and the ability to immediately prove to those you've hurt that you are trying to change is encouraging. Having a map that gets you out the mess you're in is invaluable. It really doesn't matter if it's 12 steps or 20 steps, or what science says or doesn't say. It is a map of steps that leads to freedom. It has an end goal that is success. You don't need science to see why that works. TL;DR
I have not read these links and I am not going there. I have known many people who have changed their lives thanks to NA/AA. No matter why it works, or even if it should not work. Psychology is super complex and super simple at the same time. By giving a person who has lost hope a community of peers, a support system and a process that leads to freedom, I bet that the real science of the process is much less important than the rest of the program. Having peers to answer and a phone number to call even at 3h is an incredible thing when you feel weak. Recognition and the ability to prove immediately to those you have injured that you are trying to change is encouraging. Having a card that brings you out of the mess in which you are priceless.
I've come to Reddit to get some opinions on a video series I am thinking about doing. I'd like to know if there is any interest. So here's the deal.... I've been playing LoL for just about a year. I haven't been able to play as much as I like due to a lot of health issues and a surgery. I even had to re-learn how to play with only one hand because of the problems. So I'm only a lowly silver. This year one of my big goals is weight loss. Between being a lazy ass and a lot of health problems over the last few years I've put on a lot of weight. But another goal is to be a better league player. My idea is a video series following my progress in both weight loss and league. I originally had a weight goal set for my birthday in August, but I thought why not extend it to the end of Season 4 to match up with my league progress. Of course, I have my doubts about this idea. Those being: Would anyone even be interested? How much hate will I get for being bad at league? (I'm sure a lot) How much hate will I get for being fat? (See above) And to top it off....I'm a girl GASP . So already know I'll be getting a lot of hate and rudeness, which I am willing to put up with if there is interest in the series. Let me know what you guys think. TL;DR

I initially posted this to /relationship_advice but wasn‘t getting any responses, and noticed this is a much more active sub. I‘m sorry if anything is weird or seems irrelevant, but I‘m just trying to get everything out in the ope. I (23F) have been with my SO(24M) for over 6 years As long as I‘d known him he‘s been the type to go through short, intense bouts of depression where he will be very worked up feeling that he is worthless, and doesn‘t deserve to be happy and should just do everyone a favour and kill himself. He has laid in bed, holding me, crying and saying that there is so much wrong with him. Through this I have been patient, and supportive of him, trying my best to encourage him to get help- however, he is very reluctant to get any help or even admit that there is a problem. His reasoning varies from ‘I don‘t deserve help, I‘m useless anyways‘ to flat out denying his behaviour, later laughing it off and saying things like ‘what are you talking It has always been a point of frustration in our relationship, but I‘ve always loved him regardless and I would never consider his depression a deal However, lately I‘ve been feeling very ahedonic and restless and just generally unhappy (started about 9 months ago when I started on Nuvaring with really intense depressive/suicidal symptoms. I took myself off Nuvaring, started being active again and changed my diet up and it helped for a while and for the most part. Right now I‘ve just been sort‘ve restless and unsatisfied with my life and most things in it. I guess where I‘d like some advice/help is that my bored/unhappy restlessness has been affecting my SO, he feels like it‘s his problem that I am not happy when we‘re together. I love him more than anything else in my life and would like to marry him some day but I really don‘t think I can be in a relationship with him anymore until we both figure out how to be happy. As my long blurb about him may have implied, he‘s always been sort of emotionally dependant on me (only once has he opened up about his issues to anyone but me) which I‘ve known is an issue and I‘ve somewhat enabled by Lately I‘ve noticed I‘ve been more emotionally dependant on him (and others) lately, sending him texts that are not much more than saying that I‘m sad and lonely and when he doesn‘t respond right away I just become more upset/feel lonelier, but I know it isn‘t fair for me to expect an immediate reply, or a response that‘s just an emotional pat on the head. I really don‘t think this relationship is healthy for either of us right now, but I‘m not sure how to fix it nor how he‘d handle time apart. TL;DR

Relationships are hard. I met her at the worst possible time. I was just ending a messy, clingy, and abusive relationship, finishing grad school, and entering a stressful job hunt when she fell into my life. We spent nearly everyday together for 2 months and it was a relationship better than i ever thought possible... until my previous messy relationship came back to haunt me in the form of my ex begging me for help with her life problems. Abusive relationship or not, I still cared for her on some level and didn't want it to affect this amazing thing I had found, so I explained the situation to her and asked if she'd be understanding enough to let me help my ex one last time. I assured her that it wasn't romantic and she was understanding and cautiously ok with it, but (of course) my ex made it difficult, drawn out, and ultimately damaged my new relationship. After a bit of hard work, I regained the new girl's trust and we were back on Cloud Nine. We had it all, love, trust, mind-blowing sex, everything. Then came doomsday; My job hunt was failing, I was running out of money, had to give up my apartment, car, etc. She invited me to stay with her until I got back on my feet and I did, for 2 months. After my downward spiral continued I started to feel like I just didn't deserve such an amazing person since I no longer had anything to contribute and was terrified that I was taking advantage of her love. In my depressed stupor I told her that I just couldn't live with myself anymore if there was any chance our relationship was reduced to her taking care of me, packed my things, and moved in with my parents. Almost 6 months went by in which I was just too depressed, embarrassed of my situation, and focused on fixing it to talk to her and, in the meantime, she just felt abandoned by the guy she had completely fallen in love with. I also admittedly flirted with my abusive clingy ex again just out of sheer need for romantic contact, ugh. Here I am now in month 7 and things are looking up. I'm starting a full-time contract position and I have a couple of career-level interviews lined up. My downtime hobby has unexpectedly turned into a promising start-up and I've completely disengaged my ex (who's really not guilty of anything except being clingy.) Most importantly, I've reached out the one girl I don't think I'll ever be able to give up and we've been seeing each other again. Things are starting to feel really good. The one problem is that although I have her back in my life, she's understandably too afraid too commit to me anymore. She's jaded, and I don't blame her. I left her twice to deal with my own issues and both times had dealings with a previous romantic partner (I didn't physically cheat though.) On top of that, I now know that the guy she dated before me not only cheated on her regularly, but even had multiple dedicated relationships behind her back! Anyway, I know I love her and I know she loves me. I want to be with this girl more than anything, but I've failed and let her down twice. She's scared to be hurt again and I won't allow me to be the one to hurt her (again.) We're already seeing each other occasionally with a date thrown in here and there, whenever I can get her to want to come out with me and we both agree that it's always really great to be together again, but I need to step it up. I need a grand gesture to show her that I want to be with her more than anything else. Something that screams "you can trust me I won't hurt you!" I'd love to hear some ideas! Help! TL;DR
Will do! What type of oil should I put on them to help them cast better/ work better? I've been fishing all my life, but I was taught by my papaw who grew up with cane poles and the sort so I'm still a bit of a novice when it comes to what gear works best for the job. TL;DR

Before I go on my discussion, I must say that I'm a huge Wondo fan. Great attitude, great work ethic and he appears to be an outstanding human being. I loved him when we had him (despite not playing much) and I love him to this day. However, I've never felt Wondo was good enough USMNT. People say he's the Twellman of this cycle but I felt Twellman might have been better. I've always seen Wondo's a jack of all trades, master of none. As a striker, he's average in a lot of categories, namely technical ability, athleticism, aerial ability and hold up/linking play. This sounds bad but in reality, it's pretty good given many are only average at only a few of those skills listed but poor in others. What Wondo does have more than any other striker in the MLS is crazy smart movement inside the 6 yd box that causes nightmares for defenders. In the MLS, that's been huge but I always felt he didn't have another gear to play internationally. It feels that Wondo always plays at 100%, which is awesome, it's just that his 100% isn't as high as others. I mean you could see in the 2013 Gold Cup : he started off crazy good against minnows, but as the tournament went on and the competition got stiffer, he became ineffective, eventually losing his starting spot in the last two games. I mean, look at his international scoring record, beyond the Mexico goal (which was classic Wondo "right person right place" off a missed header), it's not all that impressive. I don't think Wondo has had a hardtime winning over casual USMNT, I think he's had a hard time winning over even the hardcore USMNT beyond being a fan favorite. What did we all say when he made the 23? "This guy is a pure poacher and it makes sense to have him at the end of a game". That point blank miss didn't help his cause but he shouldn't be remember only for it. However, I do think the criticism of Wondo at an international level is fair as he hasn't had the same impact as he has in the MLS. I mean think about, Eddie Johnson, the dickish human being that he may be, is far better/consistent at the international level than Wondo despite being a fraction as effective at the MLS level. TL;DR
In the case of the MLS, which has been a large part of the U.S. skills, which is an average in many categories, namely, technical capability, athletics, air capacity and the celebration of MLS games is a very smart game within the MLS, but in reality, it is quite good given that many of them are just an average in a few of those abilities that are listed but poor in others. What Wondo has more than any other player in the MLS is the last place in the MLS is a very smart game within the MLS MLS, which has a lot to do with the MLS.
My local UPS has nice robots who idle nearby until you pick up your package. I've only seen the UPS guy once (likely a robot) and I had to sign for the package. I think they use shipping drones that aim for the door bell. TL;DR
My fiance (together 7 years, getting married in December) has always been very shy. For much of our relationship he was content to not make friends and just hang out with me instead. I'm pretty extroverted so I had a pretty wide social circle, and he always was pleasant with my friends. Things changed after college, he started working a 9-5 job and I was in a pretty intensive grad school program, so I didn't have as much time as I used to. So he started actively looking for friends and met this group of guys that like video games just as much as he does. Now, I have never been a video game fan so this wasn't a hobby we were ever able to share (despite fiance's efforts), so I was really happy that he met these friends. His social needs were addressed, and I didn't feel bad about not spending all my free time with him. For a while they just met up once a week to play video games (the other guys would meet up more often, fiance went only on Thursday nights), but then eventually they spent more time together watching movies, talking, going out to eat, etc. He speaks really highly of these guys and wants me to like them. I don't like them. And I guess that's where our problem is. My fiance lately has been constantly asking me to hang out with them and for us to go out as a group. All his friends are single, and to his knowledge none of them have ever dated anyone before. We don't have anything in common, and they also have a couple weird habits. One of them smells really bad and the other says cringey neckbeardy things about girls he vaguely knows. I typically sit quietly when they're around, which is unheard for me usually. They haven't done anything rude to me, they sort of just ignore me. A few weeks ago I told fiance straight out that I wasn't really up to hanging out with his friends. He said "but we're going to your favorite restaurant!" and that's when I told him that I wasn't too fond of them. Now, he's pretty sad about it. He's missing today's video game session because he thinks I don't want him hanging out with them. While I think he could find better friends, that's definitely not my place to say so, and I just want him to be happy. How do I explain this to him? Did I screw up here? TL;DR

pretext been unhappy for many years. Accepted it. Recently fell in love with another guy. Finally realized I need to make leaving a reality. Husband came in angry... He had this big green pretty twisty blown glass piece. He placed it in the focal point of the living room. I asked what it was and he said he bought it because it reminded him of our wedding. He said "oh, it comes with something too!" and then he slipped his wedding ring on it. "why don't you move to England?" I just sat down and didn't say anything for a bit while he walked around yelling at me, calling me "slut", "whore", "cunt", "bitch", so on and so forth. Asked if I was in love with the guy and I said yeah. Said he was going to stab me to death if he had come home any earlier. Said I was lucky... I kept waiting for the gunshot or knife... Thought for sure he was going to kill me. He was yelling at me and throwing things, put a hole in the door. Snapped my Turtle Beach headset in half so I couldn't speak with him any longer... Came up behind me and smacked me in the back of the head pretty hard... Then he came at me again and held me down by my neck while screaming at me. Came at me again with a rage that scared me but I threw my hands up to protect myself which seemed to stop him. Then he took my phone when I was trying to call my mom and did a factory reset. Then he told me to leave. Now, it's cold and I was just in capri pj's, tank top and no shoes. Tried to put on shoes but he said he bought them so I can't have them. Then said the clothes on my back were his. I said I wasn't taking them off, and my mom had given them to me anyways. He came over and ripped my clothes off... Like, literally ripped them off. He hurt me pretty badly in the process. Then he tried shoving me outside. I was pleading not to but he showed me outside. Completely nude with nothing but my numberless phone. So I dial 911.he unlocks the door. Apologizes for hitting me and stuff... Begs me not to leave. Nobody can come get me right now. Two people tried and their vehicles died on them. He seems truly sorry but I can't stay with someone that did that. I'll be going to my mom's ASAP. TL;DR
He asked me what he was and he told me he bought it because it reminded him of our marriage. He said, "Oh, he's coming with something!" and then he slipped his wedding ring on her. "Why don't you move to England? I just sat down and didn't tell them while he was walking around yelling at me, he called me "slut", "currency", "currency", so on.
He didn't have me in the middle of the living room. I asked what it was and he said that he bought it because it reminded him of our wedding. He said, "Oh, it comes with something!" and then he slipped his wedding ring onto it. "Why not you move to England?" I just said, and said nothing for a little while while he yelled at me when he came home, he said that I was lucky... I waited for the shot or knife, so on and so on. asked if I was in love with the guy and I said yes. He said that he stabbed me to death when he had come home.
He didn't listen to me. He listened to me. He told me he was going to kill me. He told me he was going to stab me to death if he had come home before. He said he was lucky... that I was waiting for the shot or the knife he was listening to me. He told me he told me he was going to kill me. He told me he was going to stab me to death if he had come home.
I was told by Ting's coverage map I had coverage. Order the SIM and went to activate, was told I had no coverage. Forced activation and... I have coverage. You also need to remember there are two different networks Ting can operate on. A CDMA and a GSM network. Each of these have different coverage. Looks like your phone is a CDMA device. I'd look into returning it and maybe finding a cheap GSM device to try. Also, depending on who you ordered from on Amazon your results will vary. They could have sold you a device targeted to another network (say a US Cellular version instead of a Sprint version) or any number of other problems like it wasn't able to even be moved to Ting from Sprint if it were a pre-owned device.

Dude, I have to chime in here and say I was faced with the same situation... 15 years ago. Ever since, I've been "cleaning up the pieces" from the wreck that ensued by not going with my strength in music. ...Still suffering as a result of having been afraid of the consequences of not choosing to be a "good boy" and do what my family wanted me to do. I listened to them decide for me, cuz I was scared and not strong. Granted, THEIR intentions are good - but that's all it is... THEIR's (colored by their experiences and dreams for you), not necessarily yours (remember, you are an individual with your own purpose to fulfill). And, of course, "good intentions pave the path to hell." As parents, they're trying to protect you - they don't see you yet as a young man. Protecting you will backfire. Ultimately, you're at a turning-point in your life, where you have to now step up as a young man and assert your authentic self/who you are. Related: "a ship is safe in harbor, but is that what a ship is made for?" - anonymous The music will never die in you, my friend - and everything else will never be as rewarding, no matter how much you're making. Everything else will just be "killing time" - fucking mundane, and everyone "normal" in your non-music world will be just as lame, living it up for Costco, coffee, and cubicles. It's a bleak picture, but once you go down that path... you're talking at least 4 years of your life, tens of g's gone, and working your ass off shuffling paper with people who have zero connection to making music. If it sounds soul-crushing - it is. If you hear the music biz can be detrimental to your health, consider the alternative of sitting on your ass 5 days/wk, eating out mostly, coffee for breakfast, then ending your day sitting on your ass trying to escape in front of a tv or at a bar - or hell, maybe both! On a brighter note, I've realized the reality being that if you're passionate and strong about something, go do it/tap into that energy and the money and fulfillment will come - it'll be a natural (not forced) extension of who you are, GENUINEly. So you'll find a way to make money doing it. It's a no-brainer. Also, "who you know" is king, and it already sounds like you're connected (= future, potential business connections... customers, partners, whatever). It would be a waste to let all of that work you've done go and not honored it. Go with your soul and you'll have wellbeing. Go against it, it'll be a constant fight/struggle/dissonance - nothing will ever feel like it "fits" or that you "fit." The longer this goes on, the more damage it causes psychologically, relationship-wise, and, ultimately, physically. Be well, dude, choose wisely :) TL;DR
Bored. I'll try. Bear with me. Big wall o' text ahead. It's work that is being done here. Electrical power and signals being converted into physical energy or vibration. Ohms are a measure of resistance to electrical current. A light bulb has resistance and therefore can be called an electrical load. It puts out energy in the form of heat and light. A speaker is also a load and has resistance and can put out energy in the form of vibration or sound. The higher ohms is actually the higher load (simplicity for speakers and amps here, don't wire your house based on this nonsense I'm spewing). An amp operating at 100 watts with an 8 ohm load will draw less current than an amp operating at 100 watts with a 2 ohm load. The 8 ohm speaker is the greater load based on the following: Electric Power=I^2 x R where I=current in Amperes R=Resistance in Ohms. It draws less current, or "juice" heh. Ya ever hear anyone say it's not the volts but the amps that kill ya? That's pretty much right. The amp will put out the nameplate power regardless of the load attached. So if it needs more current to supply that power, this is precisely what will destroy the amplifier. Overheating essentially. From too much current. BUT too many ohms on the speaker and the current in the amplifier decreases to an unusable level due to voltage drop. TL;DR

The electrical energy and signals that become physical energy or vibration. Ohms are a measure of resistance to the electrical current. A bulb has resistance and therefore can be called an electrical charge. It puts energy in the form of heat and light. A speaker is also a charge and has resistance and can put energy in the form of vibration or sound. The highest ohms are actually the highest charge (simplicity for speakers and amplifiers here, do not wire your home based on this nonsense that I am Spewing). An amplifier that works at 100 watts with a charge of 8 ohm will draw less current than a 100 watt amplifier with a load of 2 ohm. The 8 ohm speaker is the largest charge based on the following electrical energy: I^2 x R where the current of Ampers R=Resistance is also increased in m.
Safe answer: "I'm not against a god... I just believe that if there's a god out there, there's a pretty slim chance that it's the god of the hebrews." To be a bit more technical: "Okay, remember 2Tim 3:16, all Scripture is inspired by God, etc. etc?" "Yes?" "What if it's not true? I mean, what if someone, say... a Catholic priest in the 4th century added that verse to the Bible so that the Church could add all the bullshit they wanted?" If you want to be a bit more technical: 2King 22:8 and following: > 8 Hilkiah the high priest said to Shaphan the secretary, “I have found the Book of the Law in the temple of the Lord.” He gave it to Shaphan, who read it. 9 Then Shaphan the secretary went to the king and reported to him: “Your officials have paid out the money that was in the temple of the Lord and have entrusted it to the workers and supervisors at the temple.” 10 Then Shaphan the secretary informed the king, “Hilkiah the priest has given me a book.” And Shaphan read from it in the presence of the king. So what if Hilikiah didn't actually FIND the book of the law, but wrote it himself to gain political power? I mean, there's a bunch of hebrews each one with its own religion, and then the king says: Hey, I have an idea, let's make up some myths and pretend that all our suffering happened because we didn't obey some commandments that the people don't even know that existed?" Then you can go on the Deuteronomy and recall all the ridiculous laws that were put there, like no eating shellfish, no pork, not mixing crops, not wearing clothes of different textures, the mysoginy... and then ask: "Don't you at least feel that these laws aren't actually inspired by God? Them being made up by some jewish priest thousands of years ago actually makes a lot of sense to me." TL;DR
There is a sure answer: "I am not against a god... I just believe that if there is a god there, there is a small chance that it is the god of the Hebrews."

Due to my bad back and fear of getting hurt I've not done much rolling since starting BJJ. It's really picked up now and I'm rolling a lot and I've come up against moral dilemma of sorts. A lot of the other white belts I'll roll with have very limited rolling experience or haven't been training as long as I have. The problem is that I get torn between wanting to talk them through things while rolling and wanting to practice my own game. I know that as a white belt I shouldn't be coaching other students, but these instances I'm talking about are more like the other person asking me how I did something, or 'what you would do form here' etc. Any suggestions for this? I want to help them, but I've also reached a point where I want to shut up and roll and practice. TL;DR

I've got a similar story. I was in a male pageant in my high school. It wasn't a beauty pageant, per say, but more of a "who is more popular" pageant. Anyway, being the nerdy guy I am, I had to do something that would really put me ahead of the pack. So, when it came time for one of those random questions, mine was about which character (woodsman, lion, or scarecrow) I'd rather be and why. There was already a girl in the audience I wanted to ask out, so I figured I'd ask her out then. It worked in the movies. I remember saying something to the order of "I'd be the lion because I'd like to have the courage to ask out [what's her face]." The crowd loved it. She, on the other hand, did not. She ended up saying no and it made the rest of our time together (we shared a class) completely awkward. I graduated a year before her, so she had to sit through another year in high school as the girl that said no to the guy who asked her out in front of 500 people. TL;DR

My girlfriend (27F) and I (24M) had been dating for 18 months. When we met, she had a boyfriend that she told me she was planning on breaking up with. I fell for her hard and fast and when she broke up with him we were dating a week later. She is what I would consider my second real relationship and the true love of my life. I won't claim that things were always perfect. We had our share of fights, but always made up. It always ended up with us reconciling and talking about our future together. When times were good, they were the best of my young life. She was my best friend. We had so much fun! I had never met a woman that I could go out drinking with, or just hang out, or make love and enjoy it all equally. I was and am very attracted to her. We both expressed desires to one day get married and have a family together. Which was a big deal for me. I never bought into the whole white picket fence and 2.5 kid nuclear family thing. She changed all that. We were both honest to each other about our past histories. She told me that she had cheated on her previous boyfriend by getting fingerbanged by a guy. I told her the one thing I couldn't stand was infidelity. I've never understood my generation’s cavalier attitude towards sex. I've been with other women before her, and had trouble separating sex from emotion. I told her if she ever cheated on me, we would be done. It came up enough that she knew how I felt. About 2 or 3 months ago we got into a big fight. Talked about what our issues were with each other and decided to really work on them. After that, the last few months were the strongest of our time together. The best things had ever been. Our sex life was great, and we didn't argue nearly as much in the past. She seemed so happy, and I knew I was. This last Friday we went to a social function with both of our parents and lots of friends. It's an annual thing in our community where everyone gets dressed up and listens to X-Mas music. Think prom with a lot more booze and middle aged people. The whole night she is weird and distant. Doesn't want to dance with me, sit with me etc. My friends and family noticed asking me if everything was okay. We went home separately. The next day she wants to meet with me on my lunch break. When I show up she is sobbing in her car, she tells me she cares about me, but doesn't love me anymore. At least she doesn't love me like I love her. She tells me she isn't breaking up with me, she just needs a break. I asked several times if there was anyone else she was interested in. She swears up and down that there isn't anyone else, she just needs time to look at what she needs. I call into work because I don't feel like crying in front of my coworkers and go home crushed. I gave it a couple hours and called her. I broke down, sobbed and begged for another chance. I received a definitive no. I asked if she was going out with her co-workers and friends and she said yes, but she won't see me. I decide to go crawl inside a bottle and try to give her space, believing we will make it work. Cut to yesterday she calls me saying we need to meet. I meet her at a park and it's all over her face. She breaks down admitting she fooled around with the gym teacher at her school. When pressed, I came to find they went back to his place, made out for awhile and he fingerbanged her. This was especially painful for me on a few levels. One, she has always said she doesn't enjoy the feeling of getting fingered. Very rarely would she let me perform that particular sexual act, and it always ended with her asking me to stop. Two, this was the exact same scenario that played out in her previous relationship! She cried and begged me to forgive her. She told me it was different this time because she has never felt this way about anyone. I told her calmly to get the eff out of my car and left her sobbing in the park. Since then she has continued to contact me asking for my forgiveness and another shot at our relationship. She said many times she would do anything to get back with me, will never betray my trust again. She offered to let me go through her phone and emails until I feel comfortable that she will remain faithful to me. Additionally, she promised I could dictate when and where she could go with her co-workers, because she works with the guy she messed around with. She even went so far as to offer to move away with me if I so chose. That was surprising because it was a point of contention earlier in our time together. She says she can't live without me. She told me that she will do anything to make us work. At this point, I don't know what to do. I don't see me checking her phone and telling her not to go out with her friends resulting in a successful relationship. I want her to hurt like I do. I want to simultaneously never see her again and envelop her in my arms. I want to die, and I want to live, live up to my potential to show us both what she is missing. I can't help but still love her. Sorry for making this so long. Any advice would be appreciated. Should I stay or should I go? TL;DR
Just a curious question not that I'm planning on cheating or anything. My parents never really told me why cheating was wrong or ever explained why it was wrong. All I was ever told was that "it's bad don't do it" but why is it bad? I know it hurts the other person involved but why does it hurt?. I'm just wondering sorry for sounding stupid heh. TL;DR
In  TL;DR  Just a strange question not that I'm planning to cheat or anything. My parents never really told me why fraud was wrong or ever explained why it was wrong. All I've ever been said was that "it's bad not do", but why is it bad? I know it hurts the other person involved, but why does it hurt?. I just ask myself, excuse for that sound stupid heh.
EDIT: I rolled back to driver 290.53 for my GTX 560 ti and this fixed the issue Recently, after the skyrim workshop update, Skyrim has refused to launch. Everytime I launch Skyrim on Steam and even Fallout New Vegas on Steam, I get an error code 51. As far as I'm concerned this has only been happening for these two Bethesda Games. I don't think this is just a random coincidence. I looked this error code up and it seems to happen to people in various times and I believe it's a Steam problem. I have a feeling that this has something to do with registries and me messing something up with Steam. I say this because I recently upgraded from an HDD to an SSD to house my OS (Windows 7). I ran into some trouble with registries with Steam when trying to run a Steam game (Saints Row: The Third) with Windows XP compatibility mode. I then went into regedit and deleted the compatibility registries. I have a feeling that I deleted a registry that I should not have. This also might not be the reason because deleting SR3 registries has little to do with Steam Bethesda games. I have tried many things: Re-installing Steam, Re-installing both games, verifying integrity of game cache, launching from the .exe launchers in their game folders. All of these did nothing. I should also mention that when launching from SkyrimLauncher.exe, I get an error: Application load error 3:0000065432 (On top of the error pop up it says Steam Error). I'm just wondering if anybody else has been having problem similar to me and if you have fixed it, please explain how. If or when I find a solution for myself, I will surely share it in an update. Thanks for reading and not losing patience with my post or getting angry from how stupid this question might be. TL;DR
So I went on a date with this girl everything was great. Cool girl and it was a pretty solid first date. I flirted with her over text a lot and she seemed interested until a couple days ago. (Our first date was last week) She told me that she doesn't want a relationship because she's going off to college and she wants to enjoy her senior year with no worries. Also I just got out of a LTR and im not looking for a relationship either. Sounds great right? Perfect FWB situation. But she doesn't want that either. She's the type of girl who is religious and doesn't want just a fling. She told me that if it wasn't senior year and she wasnt going off to college she would be trying hard to be my girlfriend. Is it bad timing or did I screw it up and she's sugar coating it? TL;DR

I couldn't agree less. I think the fact he has been playing through it for what.. The better part of a month so far and the swelling has only gotten worse. I would play it safe like Pop'. Give him a few games off, let it get better attend to his injuries and bring him back 100% Better. Bryant played through a broken finger. Well okay, he played through a broken everything but my point is look at what it did to him. Things didn't heal properly and he played until he was force sidelined. (Not for the finger, but an accumulation of injuries not rested didn't do him any favors.) At this point in the season. Whether we are in that 1st place, or 3rd place. It matters not at the moment. We simply do NOT have to be in the first spot at the end of every single game. It sure would be nice but so would a healthy team that has been blessed in a season when injuries are destroying teams. TL;DR
Hi everyone, I always thought that exchanging follows/likes/views was easy and there were many communities that offered it, however, after searching for two days, I realized that these communities were really hard to find, and didn't offer what I'm looking for. So what I'm looking for is either : -A site where I can follow people and they will follow me back on twitter, google+, youtube so that I'm able to do Microworkers tasks -A site that pays me ( a little ) for doing these things, the closest I found was Alexa Master, and that part is completely bugged. I know this isn't entirely related to beermoney but I think it's an important topic. Thanks to anyone that can help me out :) TL;DR
So, more happened today... The not understanding owner came in and yelled at me about a blog post. In case I did not say so before: all employees are now required to contribute to the blog. The post he was yelling at me for is in regards to The Last of Us. Someone made a fan film, and my post referenced while referencing and plugging upcoming product releases for the game. It was labeled Not Suitable For Work in the blog entry. I had sent the entry a day earlier to someone at our secondary location to examine and post if it was found to be suitable. The Walking Dead Season 4 trailer had been posted a week before, and there was no tag for that. Lol He accused me of making jokes about the incident and how he handled it and of making light of a settled situation, despite the fact that it is not settled. He then went into the back room. He came out later and asked me about the printed copies if the e-mail the manager had sent. Now, these e-mails had been inside my personal lunch bag. I believe that by going into my lunch bag, he violated my personal privacy. He brought my status as a Christian into play and accused me of being nitpicky about the manager's behavior, as he is human and allowed to be cold and unprofessional to me after what he did. He asked me if I was considering litigation, and I DID lie about that. I did not like doing it, but I did not want to throw my lawyer under the bus. He left after stating that both the manager and myself would be receiving warnings, and he said there would be a meeting tomorrow at noon between him, the other owner, the manager, and myself. I cannot attend this meeting. It is at the start of my shift, and I view this as an intimidation tactic. I have called and left a message with my lawyer and am praying for the best. TL;DR
I didn't say it before: all employees are now required to contribute to the blog. The post he was yelling at me is about The Last of Us.

He believes that my data protection authority was not there today... The non-intelligent owner came and shouted me over a blog post. If I didn't say that before: all employees are now obliged to contribute to the blog. The post for which he yelled at me is related to the last of us. Someone made a fanfilm, and my post referenced, while referencing and plugging upcoming product releases for the game. It was labeled not suitable for work in the blog entry. I had sent the entry the day before to someone in our secondary place to investigate and post whether it proved suitable. The Walking Dead season 4 followers had been released a week before, and there was no day for it. Lol He accused me of making jokes about the incident and how he treated it and make the light of a fixed situation, despite the fact that it was not agreed upon. He then went into the back room. He came later and asked me about the printed copies when the manager had sent me. Well, if I had believed in my e-mails, I had my personal data.

Long story short, we had been fighting. Then I discovered he sent messages to his ex proclaiming he still loved her, and that he thought she was the one but didn't know if this was the right time for them to be together. After he was caught, and I confronted him we've been on a roller-coaster of a ride. He regrets messaging her, he cut off all contact with her, He apologized to me, He's been beating himself up since then. He doesn't feel like he deserves a second chance, but I've chosen to give him one - ONLY because it was just messages, and we had been fighting every day before it... I was trying to be understanding. He told me he didn't feel loved anymore, and he was scared I would just leave him one night, so instead of talking to me he secluded himself back to a "safe time". He now admits that was the wrong choice and a huge mistake. We haven't been fighting so much since this, Just kinda taking it day by day. I love him very much, but I don't trust him anymore, which I know is natural at this point. When I see him I still get that fluttery feeling inside, and when he calls on his lunch to talk to me I answer happily to hear from him... I know I can't expect things to be just fine right away, I know it's going to be hard and it's going to be back and forth... When I am not working and he goes to work I am incredibly sad. I can't think about anything but him, and our situation, and I just want to cry and lay in bed. When I am at work and he has the day off, all I want to do is talk to him or be at home with him. Doesn't help that I hate my job. When we're together we're okay, when I am alone I feel myself doubting that we can pull through this. Thats why I am considering a break. I was thinking we would try to take a week long break. We live together though, and I don't have my license. We share 1 vehicle and we both work. My job is too far to walk , and I work hours that would make it unsafe for me to walk or have someone else drive me. We also live with my parents, and if they knew why we were taking a break they'd never let him move back in. So even if we took a break, we'd be seeing each other every day? Think it's pointless to take a break at that point? Should we just consider working things out together at home? I would also like to add, had he sent messages like that to ANY OTHER WOMAN, I would have left. When he told me he was hurting, scared, and thought I was going to leave him - I felt the same way about him. I understood he was retreating back to something he felt was safe and someone who immediately reciprocated his affection. There's history there, it was safe, it was familiar. Just because I understood, did and does not make it okay. If it ever happens again I'm done, and I am gone. Had it been some random woman and gone to physical measures too, I would have left him that night. TL;DR
I discovered that he sent me messages to his ex by announcing that he still loved him, and that he thought it was her but that he didn't know if it was the right time for them to be together. After he was taken, and I faced him, we were on a roller coaster of a lap. He regretted sending him messages, he cut off all contact with her, he apologized, he fought since. He didn't feel like he deserves a second chance, but I chose to give him one - because it was just messages, and we had fought every day before that... I was trying to be understanding. He told me that he didn't feel loved any more, and he was afraid that I would leave him one night, so instead of telling me that he was separated from a "safe time." He now admits that it was the wrong choice and that a huge mistake.
I know that I'm not at home anymore. I know that I'm not at home anymore. I know that I haven't cared so much about him anymore. I know that I haven't cared about him anymore. I know that I'm not with him anymore. I know that I'm not with him anymore. I know that I don't have to deal with him anymore. I know that I don't have to deal with him anymore. I know that I don't have to deal with him anymore. I know that I don't have to deal with him anymore. I know that I don't have to deal with him anymore. I know that I don't have to deal with him anymore. I know that I don't have to deal with him anymore. I know that I don't have to deal with him anymore. I know that I don't have to do it with him anymore. I know that I don't have to do it with him anymore. I know that I don't have to do it with him anymore. I know that I don't have to do it with him anymore.
When I was in the same situation, I didn't feel very loved, and I was afraid that I would leave him one night, so instead of talking to me, he isolated himself to a "safe time."

So I was adding a video card and new power supply to my old setup (yes its a premade, I know, I know) and realized that my case was too cramped, so I "moved that shit" to a larger case. However, I seem to have run into a problem. I actually do not exactly know where the motherboard hookups (HDD light, reset switch, power switch, "SPEAKER"). I'm currently using the motherboard that comes default with the P7-1132 (model is AAHD3-HB). Does anyone have any advice for this, or maybe an online manual (I've looked for an online manual. The physical manual is no longer with me). Thanks in advance r/TechSupport (or not, whichever is more applicable.) TL;DR
Considering that your current industry has projected growth and the legal industry has been downsizing for about four years (and will continue to shrink) I think the prestige levels will actually swap soon. Think about it this way: why do people ascribe prestige to a field or profession? Salary Perceived intellectual demands Job security Cultural portrayals (TV, movies, literature) A. Legal jobs don't carry high salaries for the vast majority of people (even BigLaw jobs aren't actually that high considering you have to work 70 hours a week). B. People are starting to realize that a huge portion of those who went to law school decided to attend because their undergrad education didn't prepare them well to do anything else. They feel that the lack of math and science needed in law school makes it attainable as an end. Law school is very hard and demands a lot of work - but many people are still there because they were avoiding fields that were too intellectually demanding for them. C. There's absolutely no job security in the law. D. Numerous tv shows and movies about lawyers directly correspond to the oversupply of lawyers. Lawyers on TV are always depicted in expensive suits, nice cars and amazing lives. Lawyers in real life don't actually have lives like that. I can't say that there'll ever be a time when shows and moves about IT professionals will be abundant (maybe?) but it's important to remember never to mistake a fantasy for reality. TL;DR
Considering that your current industry has projected growth and that the legal industry has decreased for about four years (and will continue to decrease) I think that prestige levels will actually be exchanged soon.

Legal jobs do not carry high wages for the vast majority of people (even BigLaw jobs are not really as high as you have to work 70 hours a week). B. People are starting to realize that a large part of those who went to law school decided to go because they had not prepared their education at a lower level to do anything else.
When you consider that your current industry has projected growth and the legal industry has been cutting down for about four years (and continues to shrink) I think that the prestige levels will actually be changing soon.

It was Rumsfeld, not Cheney. Secondly, it was a radio interview where Rumsfeld didn't know he was being pranked, and he obviously didn't know who CK was after the hosts said his name. Rumsfeld later said in the interview something along the lines of "You don't think I'm stupid enough to answer that, do you?". Rumsfeld's a pro and knows that jumping into a debate with someone who's obviously pranking him is just going to make him look bad and give the people pranking him more fuel to mock him. TL;DR
It's Sunday night. Hubby and I are chilling on the couch, watching Blacklist. The only sounds are coming from the TV in this room, and (faintly) the dryer in the laundry room. In about 10 minutes, hubby is going to put his head on my lap because that's how he likes to watch movies late at night. I love nights like this. I wouldn't trade in spending time with this amazing guy for a crying, needy small human, and idk why anyone who has bingoed me believes my current arrangement needs to be "improved" TL;DR
The original post is [here!]( I'm going to go into a bit more detail here because my first post was a bit vague and because I also need an outlet to write down my thoughts. My girlfriend and I met last fall when I returned home from a 2 month Euro trip. I took this trip preceding beginning my career and a few months after a bad relationship ended. I went to simply travel, work on myself, and do something crazy essentially before settling down to work. From here on out I'll call her Mary to avoid confusion. Upon returning home I was crashing on my friends couch at his college apartment since it is close to my work. Mary is still in college finishing up her last year. We met through mutual friends one night and from that moment were inseparable. We casually saw each other for about a month before we made this official. Our relationship was really, really incredible. Awesome chemistry, never bickered, and genuinely enjoyed each other's company. All our friends were friends so we were able to spend a lot of time together with them and alone. A month or two into our relationship she wanted to talk to tell me about her past. About a year ago Mary was involved in an accident. A drunk driver on a motorcycle lost control and slid under her car. She ran him over, killing him on impact. Mary fell into a depression of sorts and her boyfriend of 3 years broke up with her shortly after the incident. From this point on she has had difficulty dealing with her emotions and controlling them. Sometimes they are all over the place, sometimes non-existent. Due to school and playing soccer for University she never had that much time to recover and take time to herself. When she told me this I was shocked. I listened and comforted her. We talked on longer I made it clear that while I can't relate, I have had some significant emotional trauma in my past so I am always available to talk. Flash forward to about weeks ago. We had another great weekend together and she tells me that she has fallen very hard for me. The next weekend is her formal for soccer and we are both excited for a fun night together. And this is the night everything changed. We both got quite drunk and she got extremely upset. She said she is getting scared and that she is worried I don't like her, that she is not sure she is ready for a relationship and this is all moving too fast. The next few days were torture. We went from this perfect relationship where for the first time in my life I felt like things were going right, I felt like I had a real purpose. To a shattered romance with everything up in the air. We talked on 4 days after and I put everything on the line. I told her how much I cared about her, that this relationship is still young and we can slow things down. We agreed not to break up, but to spend less time together to allow her to have some alone time and focus on school. The next day we spent spent together since it was a snow day and it was just like nothing had ever happened. We laughed until our sides hurt, cuddled, and spent the night together. The next two days I could tell something was wrong. This past Sunday we talked again and she said she is just not ready for a relationship right now. She wanted this so badly, but feels that something is missing right now between us for her. It is nothing I have done, it is nothing that I'm not doing. She is extremely upset because what we do have is great, but it just isn't the right time for us. I've taken this extremely hard. While I had been holding my emotions together, on this day and this talk I broke down to her when I realized it was over for now. I didn't beg or plead or anything of that sort. I simply just cried while she comforted me. I told her that I do want what is best for her and if being alone right now is what she wants then who am I to deny her that. We cannot force something to make it work it has to be organic. I told her I needed 2 weeks of no contact to straighten myself out. Since she walked out the door 2 days ago we have not had any contact. I'm doing alright, the mornings are the worst when I wake up and for a brief moment my mind is still believing we are together. But, it always sets in after a minute or so, crushing even more than last time. I do think that I was more ready for a serious relationship than her. I graduated university, traveled a lot, and now have a career. She is still finding her path in life and trying to figure out what she wants to do. I think this scared her on top of a relationship. While I told her that we won't talk for 2 weeks I intend on not talking for as long as I can last. I will check in after the 2 weeks because I said I would, but after that I'm going to cut contact without telling her. I need to not have her around right now to let myself heal and grow from this. Also, it is best for her to not have me around at the moment. My thinking is that by moving on from this we both have the ability to continue our lives and not be weighed down by this. However, it is also in the back of my head that if she begins to have to live a life without me at all it will reveal her true feelings about me. Maybe after a few months she will realize this is what she wants. While I know it is frowned upon to go back and try things again I can't lie to you all, because this is what I want. I know right now my emotions are raw, but there was seriously a magic between us. And if she doesn't come back after me cutting her out of my life then at least I have been moving towards not having her in mine. So! My question or advice I'm looking for is does this make sense? Love is not black and white and there are no set rules for everyone. There are exceptions to everything and I truly believe that one day there will be a time for us. I don't intend to wait around. I want to improve myself while she has her time to do whatever it is she needs to do. But does cutting contact really work? Long run if we don't work out I would still like to have her in my life. Sorry for this long story but I'm just in a dark place at the moment. Sometimes I feel men don't have a support network to talk about these things as much as I love my friends and family. Even if no one helps me or offers advice thanks for being an outlet for me to talk. TL;DR

Hello everyone! I'm kinda new here ,but i had read most of the latest post ,that made me feel a bit better in my situation,so thank you all for sharing your stories! Me and my girlfriend were together for almost 3 years ,in april i broke up with her because of a stupid reason,the reason that she goes at university at 180km away (not the only reason but mainly,she was also feeling very quilty when we had minorargues for nothing and couldn't study after because she was crying and couldn't focus). I thought (i was wrong though) that breaking up would be better for her. It wasn't. From here everything went downhill,she was feeling down and there was this colleague of her that was in love with her and he persuaded her into sleeping with him.(he offered her attention and she fell for it).There are some more things between but we got over mostly. I just feel disappointed that she could do it,even if she's so naive(i always told her that,now she believes me :) ) Anyway,i was with other girl [1 girl,1 time] as well (after she was with that guy 2 more times ),we both felt how is it to be apart and we know that we care about eachother and want to be together. The problem is that she got into the medical university and that's 180km away and the university takes 6 years to complete,on the other side,there's me .. i'm also at university but in this city and i'll end it in 3 years. I really want her in my life,not as a friend and i'm thinking about this middle distance relationship.I don't think it would be that hard since we both passed 2-3 months without seeing eachother after breakup and made some improvements on ourselves (i communicate much better than before and she's working on her naivete hope i got it right ). We could see eachother probably every other weekend (once every 2 or 3 weeks probably) ,i have a car so it's easy for me to go there,i can even take the train. The last problem is my trust in her,that guy she slept with is there at university as well,she told me that she was foolish,naive and didn't intend to do that to me.She regrets all of it,i know her and i feel that she doesn't lie now.She's been crying her heart out last days when i saw here because of the mistakes she did. I asked her how I know she won't go to that guy again and she said ,if you don't believe me i'll show you,just wait and you'll see.I'm thinking that she really decided not to go with anyone else until i decide (even if she starts university already) .So I don't have to worry to much but still... Finally, my question is should we try and make this relationship long distance? Maybe there are people here who share similar stories and i really hope someone can give some advice. TL;DR

lol, it's not the taste you drink for. You drink over a conversation. You drink to loosen up. After a while of following this mantra, you will have become an expert in all things alcoholic so that you will start to drink for taste. Because that taste will become associated with the drunken tomfoolery of your past. TL;DR
Basically, I got the game, played it non-stop and then decided to downgrade from IOS 8.4 beta without backing up; thinking that the game would save via iCloud. Boy was I wrong, I've now lost all my save and in all honesty, I don't feel like starting again. So be careful in case you wanted to save space by deleting the game. TL;DR
Hey guys, hopefully someone can help me out here. My roommate, who is also one of my best friends, recently broke up with a girl that I have had a crush on for some time now. I was friends with both of them and trying to be a nice guy, I offered to talk to her and make sure she was doing alright. I soon found out though, that the feelings I had for her, were mutual. My roommate suspects this, and I do not have the heart to tell him because I am worried that he will harm himself. What should I do? Am I completely wrong for having feelings for this girl? Is he being immature for wanting to control the whole situation? Any input would be greatly appreciated! TL;DR

When I was 5, I used catch the biggest ant I could find and try to rip its legs off and laughed at its futile attempt to bite me. Their heads came off everytime before I could get all the legs. Needless to say, I don't think i've ever encountered fire ants. TL;DR

I stopped playing ranks because of the amount of trolls and bad players in my bracket, which I might add is extremely low lately because I had a string of trolls five ranked matches Ina row...each match had a 10 minute que interval...personally I find it sad that people enjoy doing this... Then when I watch streams of higher elo players and see them trolling it kind of pisses me off because they encourage the trolling. TL;DR

I'm so sorry you had such a bad experience with someone who has a science background. I am a geology-guy. Here's what I would have done: I would have picked you up in YOUR driveway, left you room to get in the car, turned the car off, then I would have escorted you through the ice and opened the door for you. Next, I would give you an amazing dinner at a really nice restaurant, not Olive Garden (chain restaurants really lack the genuine quality of nice, locally-owned restaurants). I would have sparked up healthy, intriguing conversation. After that, I would have rather taken you to a parlor or my home or anywhere with a piano and, instead of showing you how smart I was, played you Chopin's No.9 Nocturne (opus. 2) or some video game music (I specialize in playing music from The Legend of Zelda and Final Fantasy). I wouldn't have downplayed your intelligence at all, as the word "enigma" is an extremely common word (at least in my experience) and it is a wonder to me how a man who seemingly calls himself a sciencey-guy, doesn't know a word in the English language as simple as that one, but I digress. I would have treated you with the utmost respect as every person, until proven otherwise in my book, should be treated well. Arbys? McDonalds? I hate chains. Sub-par food, occasionally good service, and expensive yet watered down alcoholic beverages. I would have been fine with the popcorn and wouldn't have taken you there. Upon driving you home, I would maneuver my car in any way possible so that you were able to get out of the car. I'd then move the car next to the snowbank so I could get out and I'd walk you to your front door. Upon you getting ready to walk in, that's when I'd go in to try to kiss you. But that's just me TL;DR
To configure the machines for an elector, you have to literally hit two buttons on the back (Select the party rather than 'on'). For the general election, it is only a button ('on'). To configure and remove the machines, there are very precise instructions on how to do it, and every time we have to pass on how to do it because none of us really remembers haha.

I'm a fifth-year doctoral candidate in English dissertating on late Victorian and Edwardian translators of Greek and Latin poets. I still feel very much like a classicist, and still translate from both languages as part of my work. As a classicist in a Victorianist's weeds, I often feel a little weird; when I was still doing coursework, taking seminars and colloquia in literary criticism, I often wanted to talk about the grammar and prosody of the poetry we were reading, whereas everyone else deemed it totally normal to foreground biographical and theoretical matters to the exclusion of just about all else. It got to the point where I used a paper on Theocritus's Idyll 13 (yes, in a theory class) to scream from the rooftops that sometimes it seems that no-one in English has read the text with anything approaching the attentive diligence inculcated in me (actually, hammered into my habits) whilst in undergrad. (Incidentally, the professor in that course loved the paper and agreed with my exasperation and gave me an A+). I'm curious to see if anyone else is in another field and has had similar experiences. When I meet classics PhD students here (at my institution their department is nowhere near as highly ranked and respected as my own) I envy them like crazy, even though I know their job market makes even mine look merciful. TL;DR
So, I love Pokemon, i've been playing and a fan for 15 years. I have learned about IV breeding, (Got two 4 Perfect IV Pokemon), i've learned about nature's.

I am not looking for a step by step clone guide. I am not looking for "Omahgawd you need this pokemon to compete" I want to be able to compete with the pokemon I like, and understand the strategies. I am looking for someone to spend time chatting with who can answer questions. TL;DR

Hello AskWomenAdvice. I've messed up, and I would appreciate some perspective on it. I'm going to change a couple of details so it's not too obvious who I am, and apologies for the wall-of-text, but I'm desperate. I (19m) have been seeing my girlfriend (20f) for about a year and a half now, and things have always been great. Like, really great. She's my best friend, and I can honestly say that not only have I never been happier in my life, but, as a deeply good individual, she's honestly made me a better person. We've been abroad together, we've been there for each other when we've been ill, we've laughed and cried with each other, we've met each others families, and nothing worse has happened before now than a few minor spats. Now, the fuck up. I went for a night out with my housemate (my other bestfriend), a female friend and a guy from work. We all got incredibly drunk, to the point I don't remember large portions of the night. Someone suggested we go to the strip club. I'd never been before this point, and I'm very uncomfortable as stripclubs (or, accurately, stripteases) was a major grey area in our relationships. We'd made jokes about it previously, but really I never expected to end up in this situation. So, I get in, buy a couple of drinks, and resolve not to do anything stupid. After a while, I notice my friends alternating between talking to one of the girls working there and pointing at me. I can't work out what is going on. Next thing I know, I'm being grabbed by the hand and pulled off, the girl insisting that, as it's my first time, I had to have a dance. I don't particularly want one, but I'm already being pulled away, and frankly I felt pressured into paying $20 for a 3 minute dance. It was deeply uncomfortable, but I'm not going to pretend I couldn't have out my foot down and stopped it. It gets worse. My girlfriend was going through some incredibly tough times at her work, to the point that she was one step from bursting into tears on me when I saw her the next day. I'd resolved to tell her about the night before, but I couldn't bring myself to do it. It honestly would've crushed her at a time she really needed support. So, I told myself I'd tell her at the next best opportunity. The next day, she was even more stressed with deadlines, and people hounding her to do this and that. Another case of turning to me for support. I couldn't tell her when she was already crying into my chest. She told me she'd feel fine after her deadline in two weeks time for a big project, but until then she'd be seriously struggling. And she wanted to have sex with me. Rock and a hard place. Do I tell her now and crush her when she's already under severe pressure? Or act as if nothing is wrong for the time being and tell her when she has less on her shoulders, even if it means some shady behaviour? I went for the latter option. I'm ashamed to say I slept with her during this time period. Yeah, I know, it's fucking horrible what I did. So, after this two week period, she invites me over. We chill out, have a chat, and I tell myself that now is the best time. I handled it badly - I wanted to get it off my chest and shoehorned it into the conversation. Worse, I panicked, and said some things I really regretted - I wanted to express that there was absolutely no desire or attraction to the dancer throughout, and that I couldn't even remember what she looked like. When she asked if the girl was better looking in a bit if dark humour, I repeated what I had heard from the others the morning after - that she was 'butters' and 'flat-chested'. Again, I panicked, and this is extremely out of character for me - enough that my girlfriend (an ardent feminist) now isn't sure that I'm the same person she thought I was, on top of not knowing if she can trust me. This is probably the thing I'm most ashamed of. Somehow she let me stay the night, and I agreed to attend her production the day after. I did, we met up afterwards, had dinner, and went out for a bit afterwards. It honestly felt like we were back to normal. She said she forgave me - albeit she didn't entirely trust me, or love me quite as much (more dark humour). We laughed a lot, joked, smiled, kissed, and said goodbye before heading home for a few days. Our messages went back to normal. Now, as of the last day or so, her messages have suddenly changed back to being short, sparse, and she's told me that she is still hurting (fair enough, I expected as much) and implied that she still isn't sure if she's ready to keep seeing me. This blind-sided me as I thought we were back on at least talking terms. I understand that she hadn't had much time to process the info, but it was quite a shock to see such a turn around. Here's the thing - I fucked up awfully. I. I acted badly, I handled it badly, and I followed through with it badly. My girlfriend means the world to me, and I'd give anything - literally anything - to turn back the clock a couple of weeks, put my foot down and say no. I guess I'm a lot weaker than I thought. I've made it very clear to her that I am deeply sorry, and that I'm willing to do whatever it takes to make our relationship work, including giving her plenty of time to think about what she wants to do. If she wants to break up with me, then fair enough; as she's a wonderful person who does not deserve such behaviour. But at the very least, I want her to know that, deep down, I'm a good person who made an awful mistake; the same person she's been in love with for the last year and a half, and that this monumental fuck up will never, ever happen again. TL;DR
I don't know what I know. I don't know what I know, I don't know what I know, I don't know what I know. Now I don't know what I know. I don't know what I know, I don't know what I know. I don't know what I know, I don't know what I know. I don't know what I know. I don't know what I know. I don't know what I know, I know what I know, I know what I know, I know what I know. I don't know what I know.
I have been haggling and I would appreciate it. I (19m) have seen my girlfriend (20f) for about a year and a half, and things have always been great. How, really great. She is my best friend, and I can honestly say that I have not only never been happier in my life, but, as a very good individual, she has become me honestly a better person. Now, the fuck-up. I went for a night with my colleague (my other best friend), we laughed and cried together, we met each other, and nothing worse happened before now than a few smaller splits. Now, the fuck-up. I have a woman from work for one night with my friend (my other best friend), we all have at work.

How am I insulting them? I am stating clearly that their philosophy is suboptimal and even simple logic proves it. Balance for the masses: Makes the balance for competitive play bad (unstable, strict meta, boring, loopsided, plagued by the same issues again and again), makes the balance for all other demographics... Also bad. The demographics - how many million players, again? - are so numerous, different, their wants and "needs" so volatile, change day to day... You can't balance specifically with them in mind. It's a self-defeating task. Balance for competitive play/the pros: Makes the balance for competitive play good, makes the balance for all other demographics... Also good. How? Simple, everyone else adapts. They don't know any better. Some will still bitch and complain, but still play. Some won't even notice that the balance is being aimed at the pros, they will merely keep playing, not notice anything different and just "adapt". Meanwhile the pros get a more stable yet less constricted playing field to work with, more viable Champions... Speaking of which, funny that you mention J4 possibly being too strong (I don't even want to entertain the notion that Vi is too strong) and that they should nerf them, as the outliers . No, of course not. Why the hell would you nerf them?!? J4 isn't oppressive, neither is Vi. They don't deserve nerfs. Useless Junglers with outdated kits deserve buffs. Weak and forgotten Champions require partial or full remakes, some others simply need numerical tweaks. The fact that you think they need nerfs is... Well, it shows that you do think like Riot. "Boo hoo, if we do that, power creep, bla bla" - standard excuse with no justification. No one is saying that, if you buff other junglers now, that you will then buff J4 in the future, then the others again, and thus enter a vicious cycle. That doesn't make sense. It's basically a "slippery slope" fallacy. That would never happen... Some Champs only need a single set of buffs/remakes and that is it. From then on, you tweak them with small nerfs and buffs either way. The myth that this approach - buffing loads of weak Champs instead of constantly nerfing the "outliers" - would cause a power creep is laughable, baseless. It would imply that Riot are morons (which I don't think they are); there is no other scenario bar them being stupid where such an approach would fail. If anything there is a negative power creep going on right now (for ages, really) due to the way they have been balancing, via nerfing the "outliers"; especially with constantly removing/nerfing CC and non-skillshot abilities as well. Not to mention the always present mobility creep. Do they do anything about the mobility creep? Of course not. God forbid they add Cripple (the form of CC originating in Smite) and make other Summoner Spells more powerful to quell the prevalent nature of Flash. That would be too hard, despite the fact that it would improve every aspect of the game without hurting its core identity. Meanwhile - and these are outliers* - they constantly release broken Champions. Azir? Far too strong, despite squishiness. Rek'Sai? Badly designed Champion, simply far too weak... That everyone picked and banned because of her ridiculous damage output that got nerfed within 2 patches. No one notices that though, and, soon, she will fall into obscurity until she (like many others should) receives a minor remake akin to Sejuani's. Kalista? Do I really need to say anything about her? I'm sitting here trying to think of a weakness... But, no, me calling her broken (in the standard OP way) got ignored, got downvoted... And then NA LCS happened. "Oh wow she is so OP". TL;DR

That philosophy is unoptimal, and even simple logic proves it. Balance for the masses: Makes the balance for the competitive game bad (unstable, strict meta, boring, loopsided, plagued by the same themes time and again), makes the balance for all other demographies... Also bad. Demography - like many millions of players, again? - are so numerous, different, their desires and "needs" so volatile, change day after day... How? Simply, everyone else adapts. They don't know better. Some still get annoying and complain, but still play. Some won't even notice that the balance for the competitive game is good, they will only play, not always pay attention to anything else.

Also bad. Balance for competitive play/pros: It makes balance for competitive play good, makes balance for all other demographics... Also good. How? Simple, all others adapt specifically with them. They don't know anything better. Some still complain, then, but still play. Some do not notice that balance for competitive play good, they realize that the work of fans is much easier to notice.
Howdy Everyone! I just wanted to recount some of the discoveries I made during some SL20 +2 Duels and Invasions. At these low levels, scaling due to stats is basically non existent, which meant that weapons that would normally be considered "unviable" due to poor scaling or split damage shine like crazy here. For example, Drakeblood GS and the Dragonslayer's Axe easily out-damage any other weapon in their class; add to that their ability to buffed with elements they already have and you can be sure that anyone on the receiving end is due for a wallop. Heck, unbuffable weapons (like the infamous GS of Judgement) hit like a truck, making builds at these levels way more diverse for me compared to any other level. "But Niko," I can hear y'all say, "what if I don't like twinking or doing low level runs to get these items? Am I stuck with plain old boring weapons?" Well Timmy (probably not your name, but you look like a Timmy to me) do I have a treat for you! The most terrifying weapon I found for SL20 PvP is none other than... The Dark Hand! Yes, the thing you tried to command grab someone with and failed utterly is actually a brutal melee weapon. You can get it as soon as you unlock Yoel, so it is perfect for this level of play. The absolute best part, however, is that it requires no minimum stats . I cannot overstate how useful this this. Given the terrible scaling the Dark Hand gets with only 10-15 stat point allocations, you can instead channel those points into VIG. Since the Dark Hand weighs 0 units, after you stick on a parry item and a lightweight crossbow, you can put on your heaviest armor sets with no qualms! Combined, these factors net you a 1000+ HP tank with resistances in the 20+ with an easily obtainable weapon that takes less stamina to use than a roll at SL20 . Slap on any rings you may want (I recommend Life+RoF+Hornet+Prisoner's myself) and welcome to the new world of Souls Fighter 3. TL;DR
Howdy Everyone! I just wanted to tell some of the discoveries I made during some SL20 + 2 Duels and Invasions. At these low levels, the scale due to statistics is fundamentally non-existent, which means that the weapons that would normally be considered "inviable" due to the low scale or scintillating damage shine like crazy here. For example, Drakeblood GS and the Dragon Slayer's Axe have easily compensated any other weapon in their class; add to that their ability to buzz with elements they already have and you can be sure that anyone at the reception point is due to a wallop. Heck, inbuffable weapons (like the infamous GS of Judgment) hit like a truck, making constructions at these levels much more diverse for me compared to any other level.

I had a similar situation, GF hated my friend for constantly making racist and rape jokes. We tried talking to him about it he ended up doing it more and tried to laugh it off. I told her Iv been friends with him for 10 years I know he says stupid stuff but he is a good guy Iv seen him help alot of people. I can't just abandon him. It didn't fly. Since then I have drastically cut back on drinking, quit smoking, got a $20K raise and started a side business. Your situation is different but mine somehow worked out. TL;DR
Hey guys, Just want some opinions if this would seem creepy/weird. (I'm a 26 male btw) So I was at a bar last weekend with some friends and I was going to grab myself a drink so I asked the group if they wanted any. One of the girls in the group asked for another glass of Muscat, so I went to get the drinks but was told they ran out of Muscat and had to go to the resturant bar to order more. I went to the resturant bar and there was this really cute girl behind the bar, I asked for the Muscat and she didn't look like she knew if they had and looked a bit confused, so she looked around and saw it on the top shelf, she's fairly short so she pulled a box over to stand on and I laughed, she turned and said "If I fall over and have to get stitches I'm blaming you and you'll have to take me to hospital". After she poured the glass she said it's $7 and asked if that's how much it was last time, I jokingly said it was only $5 last time while smiling and she laughed. Later on that night she was at the main bar and came over to serve and then she saw it was me and says "Oh it's you, I'm not serving you!" and starts walking off as a joke but then comes back and serves me. I was planning on asking for her number a bit later in the night and after a bit more "liquid courage" but about half an hour later I saw her with her bag on her shoulder walking out the doors. So my main question is would it be weird if I went back there next weekend, hopefully she'll be working again and as a joke asking for some Muscat (So she will remember who I am), and try and talk to her and get her number (but not make it look like I'm there just for that reason, friend and his wife said they'd come along to make it look like we are there for a few more drinks). I know I should have asked for it straight away instead of waiting and missing my opportunity, and I suck at picking up on girls flirting with me but looking back it sounds like she was flirting quite a bit! :-\ TL;DR
So just a little background, we have been dating 8 months now. This is her first ever relationship and my 2nd serious one. We are both virgins but are pretty sexually adventurous. So my girlfriend Maddie and I have been dating for 8 months and it has been amazing. This girl is beautiful, athletic and honestly the smartest person I know. We have been thought the honeymoon phase Id say and are very comfortable with each other. I'd say we communicate pretty well and have similar views and personalities. Our biggest disagreement was when she was getting annoying about asking for the identity of a friend who lost their virginity or this one time she hurt my feelings. Both were over and done with in 10 minutes. My big question is shouldnt we be having fights. We're still young and this isn't even a big concern it's just kind of an oddity to me. Any input would be great! TL;DR

Met a guy[25/M] that I [26/m] liked, and he didn't feel the same. Nbd, it's not fun to deal with but it's part of life. Put on your big girl panties and deal with it. We were friends for a year or so, but after a few rough patches the friendship slowly deteriorated. Our friends mingled, so I saw him around and everything, but I never felt comfortable initiating conversations. He always initiated, and whenever there was too much silence or time gone by without contact, he'd send me a message or whatever. Towards the end of our friendship, however, he was absolutely desperate to speak to me. I mean he wasn't crazy or anything, but it made me super uncomfortable. I kinda want to know what it was like to be in his shoes, but we're not really talking. (I've tried :( he's not a huge fan of serious talks). Why would a guy who has lots of great friends, and is seemingly popular with the ladies react like this? I'm pretty great, don't get me wrong, but I had nothing to offer him from his point of view. We were never sexual (don't think he had intentions of trying), we weren't best friends, and I just...irked him sometimes. That's what puzzles me the most, I seemed to get on his nerves all the time, and he wasn't interested in me, but he didn't respond the same way when I backed off. TL;DR
Have to disagree with you here. Nitefinders don't shoot streamlines (very well). I you buy an Elite Blaster with the blue streamlines than you are fine but otherwise I would suggest looking at the Darttag line which has a number of blasters that work with the same darts as the nitefinder. TL;DR
Ok, temp account and long story. My boyfriend [27/m], I'll call him S, had been very close friends with M [25/m] for a while before I became friends with both of them several years ago. We met through a mutual hobby, but I lived out of state so while I was friends with them I was never super involved with either of them. After about a year S and I started dating, and immediately after S and I and M had our first falling out. That in itself is a long story, but ultimately it stemmed from a misunderstanding thanks to a communication breakdown between all parties involved. Ultimately, though, everything was worked out and everyone got back on good terms, though M and I never quite got our friendship back to where it was. Quite a while after that S and M had another falling out, this time involving a few other mutual friends. S decided he was fed up with M at that point and when M made what S viewed as only a few half-hearted attempts to reach out to S, S swore off the friendship entirely. For the record here, I think what M and a few others did (basically ignoring him continually in favor of some other mutual friends) was pretty lousy and I don't blame S for being mad. That said, I think he's gotten a little melodramatic over it and blown it further out of proportion than it needed to be; M can be thick headed and thoughtless at times but doesn't do it to be mean; he's just a little oblivious and needs people to be blunt with him. M and I are still kind of friends. Not exactly talking all the time friends, but enough friends that M will occasionally ask me for hobby advice, as I am much more experienced in it than he is. S thinks I should tell him to piss off and thinks he'd only really using me for my knowledge, but honestly we haven't been that close friends for a while and I don't see anything terribly wrong with how he acts; I have many friends in various hobbies and interests where things directly related to it are pretty much all we talk about. S has made it clear he'd prefer it if I completely ignored M, but I am concerned that's too radical of an action here. Part of me wants to confront M about what's been going on, but another part of me just wants to leave it alone and let the friendship die out on it's own. I don't feel like I'd lose anything terribly important over it, but we do still have some mutual friends that he's pretty much my only link to. Is it best to just accept that it's not really worth trying to be friends and ignore him, let things go as they are, or try to talk to him about the whole situation and risk escalating it further? TL;DR
I used to work at a department store while earning my college degree, but I quit to focus on finishing my Bachelor's and starting a new Master's program. Unfortunately, I've had no success finding a full-time job so I came back to work temporary (good thing I didn't burn any bridges!) until I can find another more well-paying job. One service that my dept. store offers is a credit card that can be used to purchase clothing and other good stuff. The company pushes us employees extremely hard to try to make everyone apply for this card, and offers customers incentives like extra percentages off a purchase to entice them into buying clothes on credit. Unfortunately, many customers do not fully understand the terms of the credit card, and this can lead to them getting angry at us when something bad happens (as if we're the ones who drafted the terms and not...you know...the bank). I had the pleasure of witnessing an incident with such a customer. This happened earlier this week with one of my co-workers. It was a slow day and relatively quiet until this customer showed up... > Co-worker: Hi, did you find everything all right? >Customer: Yes, I did, thank you. > Co-worker: rings up items Okay that will be $70. > Customer: ...wait, where's my $20 credit? > Co-worker: I'm sorry? > Customer: My $20 off. I returned some items earlier and got a $20 credit on my credit card. Where is it? > Co-worker: I....don't...think it works like that, ma'am. > Customer: What?!? It can't be that hard. Just give me my $20 off. >Co-worker: rattled and confused I..I'm sorry....I don't..I don't think I can do that. >Customer: This is crazy, let me speak to your manager. I got a $20 credit and I'm not getting ripped off. I just want to note that whenever a person returns an item purchased on a credit card, they receive a credit for the amount they paid for. This credit gets subtracted from the final total of the next bill. For example, if Bob returns a shirt for $15 and then buys a pair of pants for $30, he'll end up only needing to pay $15 when his bill comes ($30-$15). However, this is all done by the bank and has nothing to do with the store. It's literally impossible for us to take a credit off their next purchase at the register. > Manager: Hi, how can I help? > Customer: irate Yeah I have a $20 credit and I demand that you guys give it to me. It's MY credit. > Manager: I'm sorry ma'am, we can't do that. He then explains how credits on cards work, just like what I said above > Customer: But...but I still get $20 off either way. Why can't you just give it to me now? > Manager: I'm sorry ma'am, but that's just how our credit card works. The bank handles all of the credits and purchases. Did you still want these items? > Customer: NO. Just forget it, okay? I don't want them if YOU won't give me my credit. > Manager: Fair enough, have a good day! :) > Customer: HMPH stomps out of the store What confused me the most about this customer is that she would have gotten the $20 off (just on her bill not the purchase). There wasn't any need to get upset with us and then storm out without buying what she wanted. If we had taken $20 off her purchase, she would have still received the $20 credit on her bill, resulting in her getting a total discount of $40. TL;DR
I've asked a few questions, and have plenty more, being my first year cutting my own wood. When do you all get out there and start? I'm in Central New York state and it's 18 below zero Fahrenheit. I've done a little bit of work with the new carbide chain I bought, but holy crap as a one-man operation this would be so much easier without snow on the ground and frost in my nose. But, if now is the best time I will keep going out there. TL;DR

For me, Ritalin is turning out to be a lifesaver and godsend and better than any antidepressant. I started it 6 weeks ago and despite dealing with raging UTI/kidney infection during the first month (effecting energy levels and overall generally making me feel physically crappy), the benefits have been amazing. And it's not just what I've been able to accomplish, productivity wise… Case in point, I'd like to share an anecdote about last night. I got together with some friends, one is a friend I see every few months, the other is a new acquaintance who, like me, was recently laid off and is also looking for work. I found myself comparing. I realized that last few times I saw my girlfriend, I was mopey, lethargic, my self esteem was in the toilet, and I lacked confidence. I may have come across to her as depressed, but I had a lot of legitimate reasons to be down on myself, as my career was failing and I was losing my job. Last time she was here, I could barely get myself out of bed before noon. It was not just physical fatigue, it was overwhelming brain fog and inability to be able to put two sentences together, verbally or in my head. I was spacey and disengaged and had a hard time following her attempts at conversation, and not for lack of interest. My memory was shot - she'd bring up stuff from the past or even recently and I'd vaguely know what she was referring to, but be at a lost to remember the details. I was just in this huge fog. And my house was a disorganized mess (luckily she is a good friend who doesn't care). Flash forward and now my house is fairly clean and slowly getting organized. I was on time to meet up with her. I even made the dinner reservations for us - instead of procrastinating or feeling overwhelmed at the prospect of figuring out the evening's logistics. I didn't struggle to get dressed, because all my laundry was done. The fog is gone and I could remember what she'd reference. I had a lot to share with her because I've accomplished a lot in the last 6 weeks. I was fully engaged in our conversation. I was confident, upbeat, positive. I was happy. I kept thinking to myself… wow, this is how I'm supposed to feel. I remember feeling this way a long time ago. It's so nice to feel this way again. I am not "too" happy.. I am just right happy. I am normal! Meanwhile, the new acquaintance came across to me as very depressed. Flat affect. Gloomy. Barely talked much, no matter how I tried to drag her out. I could totally commiserate on her job search struggles. But she started to turn me off because she was such a Debbie Downer, her perspective was warped and negative. She viewed the job market as horrible and hopeless (we are in exact same field) whereas I am viewing it as hot with tons of opportunities all around… Note, by the time we met up the Ritalin was already out of my system. So these changes are more because of what the Ritalin is helping me accomplish during the day, which in turn, makes me feel better about myself overall. TL;DR
I started it six weeks ago, and despite the rage of UTI/Kidney infection during the first month (using energy levels and generally making me feel physically shitty), the benefits were incredible.

Your argument would be stronger with some examples but there's no doubting that countries will do what is in their interest. I've always thought of international relations as the supreme arena of hypocrisy. But international principles can still change the calculus that states have for determining their interests. While a stronger state might attack and annex a weaker one if they both existed in a vacuum, it might figure that the international condemnation it will likely get in the real world will not be worth the benefits accrued, and so may refrain. Countries take the trouble to find justifications for war because the principles I mentioned exist. TL;DR
I'm still quite unfamiliar with the whole SSE thing, and do not even know if a C implementation would be that usefull, as I have no problem with assembly. As far as I've learned from Wikipedia, there's an instruction set which I could use to do the operations I need, and that would require adding some extra compilation arguments (Ps:I'm coding with Qt Designer, thus compiling with GCC...). Any help or link would be greatly appreciated! TL;DR

Just going to point out that this was an in vitro study, only held for one of the two lines they tested, was published by researchers at an institution in Thailand that was established 8 years ago. It's also still has some proofreading stages to undergo before final publication. That being said, the paper did allay some of my initial suspicions about how they could have messed up. They used biologically relevant concentrations of Glyphosate (at least the same range of concentrations present in measured human urine). There's still a lot of questions though. Urine might have more concentrated glyphosate than the blood stream would - why not use blood levels instead? There's no evidenced dose response ( you'd typically expect twice as much of a chemical to cause twice as much cancer not the best way of saying this), and they don't seem to be able to reach significance for the majority of measured cohorts. They also didn't see that much of a difference over 6 orders of magnitude of concentration... which points to a small effect size. There's also the deal that they only used two lines and only saw an effect in one of them. Looking for synergistic effects is a good idea, especially with soy which may increase breast cancer risk as well, and they claimed to have found some, although the effect size still seems very small to me. The title is also somewhat misleading - they've provided no evidence that Glyphosate will cause new cancer cases, only that it might increase cell proliferation in people that already have cancer. It would be unfair to dismiss this article out of hand, but the current lack of any credible research to demonstrate real effects in human or animal in vivo studies means that in vitro studies, especially relatively small ones that failed to reach significance on a lot of important measures, need to be taken with a grain of salt. TL;DR
If we consider that this is an in vitro study, which was conducted only for one of the two lines tested, was published by researchers from a Thai institution established 8 years ago. There are still a few stages of rereading before the final publication. However, the article dissipated some initial suspicions about how they might have been mistaken. They used biologically relevant concentrations of Glyphosate (at least the same range of concentrations in measured human urine). There are still a lot of questions. Urine may have more concentrated glyphosate than blood flow would - why not use blood concentrations instead? There is no response to the demonstrated dose (it is generally expected that twice as many as one chemical will cause cancer than the best way to say) and they do not appear to have any real effects on the majority of the measured cohorts.
Just to point out that it is an in vitro study that was published only for one of the two lines that they tested was published by researchers at an institution in Thailand that was founded 8 years ago. It is also still some corrective reading stages to undergo before the final publication. That is, the paper has some of my first suspicions of how they might have ruined. They use biologically relevant concentrations of glyphosate (at least the same range of concentrations in measured human urine). There are still many questions. Urine could be more concentrated glyphosate than the blood stream would - why not use blood levels instead? There is no proven dose response (you would normally expect twice as much of a chemical to double as much cancer not the best way to say this), and they do not seem to be able to achieve importance for the majority of the measured cohorts. They have also not seen that much of a lot of action already on a small effect...

Quite a difficult one. For me it's impossible to pin down a 'BRAVE moment', I cherish so many memories form my time in Brave. Although it's interesting to see how what you appreciate as a player evolves over time. My most endearing memories of Rahadalon are newbie to the core. Getting on my first killmail with a Merlin, seeing my first titan (a PL Avatar) in Nakah, Kill: Motre (Revelation), Asking if it's worth fitting guns to suicide tackle , going into a WH for the first time and having Andrew Jester lose half the fleet, 'need people on the Mendori gate there's freighter coming through', the RvB war, helping found Brave dojo with Hail Sagan, getting my first T2 ship - a hound - for ratting battleships in curse... the list is endless. These are not things I would wish to repeat, but I enjoyed greatly at the time. In Barleguet I feel that I actually 'learned how to play', with most experiences being something I can relate to today. The endless POS bashing with LePetite ]( discovering the joys of POS reactions with some friends, joining my first social channels (most of which I'm still in today), calling 'Blue ICe is primary' whilst FCing an anti-leadership fleet on Kennick sun, lighting a cyno so that we could kill SNUFF dreads that dropped on NOC's carrier camp, flying an unkillable Scorpion in Megaladon fleets that [still has a top place on my killboard years later]( [getting my first capital ship]( becoming 'space middle class' [via DED sites]( and starting to PLEX my accounts for the first time... Again, not things I would necessarily like to repeat, but are fond memories nonetheless. Sendaya/Catch was different. Aside from the [extremely fun deployment speculation]( I went in smugly ahead of everyone else, personally deploying with a few cap pilots in suitcase carriers half a day before the announcement was made. Which pretty much defined my Catch experience in a nushell. For the first time I was 'at the top' of the corp in terms of experience and SP, newbie frigates roams didn't interest me, they exasperated me. That's not to say Catch wasn't fun, I just felt that the majority of Brave 'ideals' were conflicting with my own. [Skynetting inties in V-3]( [Watching the hilarious conclusion to Fanfest '14 together on comms]( dropping for the first time with Brave caps to help set timers, almost losing my archon as Levi Scutter forgets to bring warp core stabs in his Nid, [becoming the alliance mogul on DED sites]( [enjoying Brave first T2 cruiser fleets]( having some of the most fun I've had in Eve piloting an Onyx in said fleets, etc etc. Of course, [Catch is where I left Brave]( for the reasons I put in that post. I'll always enjoy helping people in Brave Dojo and chatting to friends made during my time in corp, but I just feel that Brave as an alliance is no longer for me. Also fuck that got preachy. Sorry. TL;DR

I agree with adding some more depth than that. Getting some of this drama in is fine. But I feel they have lost sight of what made Suits Suits. I think it's good they dont stick to the same pattern, it makes show become boring (look at House M.D. 80% of most episodes were pretty much the exact same build-up, despite being awesome, it got pretty annoying). But this shit's getting old, and it's only gonna get worse, I think. I'm certain Mike will break up after Rachel tells him (next ep probably), and after that Mikes probably gonna end up in some miserable slump. Maybe starts smoking weed again or something, to underline the obvious rockbottom he's hit. Rachel's probably gonna seek council with Donna, who will advise her to "give him some time" or something like that. And I think they will drag this "will they get back together or won't they?" on for a longer while than needed. And they might even decide to make it worse, because collusion happens with two people. Why not also force Harvey to patch up the broken Mike because Cahill is riding their ass with his personal vendetta, and he can't have Mike being an easy way into his bussiness in his current state.

A few months ago I met a guy, and we went on a couple of dates, but he has a low self-esteem and a history of dating abusive women, so he chose to ask if we could just be friends, because I am "too nice" and said I treat him too well, but that he might want to try again someday, if it was okay. I told him when we "broke up" that I'd be fine with us trying to date again, in the future, but that I never wanted to feel like I was his back up choice, and he would have to make the first move. Since that day, he has become a very good friend. We hang out frequently, have fun talking and doing platonic activities together, and he's an amazing guy. The confusing part is he regularly tells me how great I am, how sexy I am, how I'm "tempting" him by inviting him to things I enjoy and think he'd enjoy too, how much he is struggling to not want to date me, how he's never known anyone he gets along with so well, etc... and in the same conversation bringing up how he doesn't want any kind of romantic relationship with anyone right now. I'm not doing anything I would consider romantic, or "tempting." I am treating him like I treat any of my friends: with respect and kindness, and doing what I can to make his day brighter. I'm not sure what to say/do when this comes up. TL;DR

No Throwaway for this. First-time poster here, fuck it. This FU, like most, did not occur today. Let's bring this back to first grade recess in a smallish country town. My class had just been let out for recess. Thank God. Let's go play together and have some fun. There was this group of girls I was interested in (come on, it's first grade) and I wanted to play with them. Seems like they didn't want to play with me because they kept running away anytime I'd get near them. As we all became friends later on, this was just them teasing me as we were young kids. I wasn't having the teasing this day, not one bit. After they run away and turn to point for the last time, I climb up onto the curved ladder [shown here]( and just...drop trou. I was only trying to moon them, my 6 year old mind though. Well, being on said ladder, as well as not having any restraint of how far down I would pull my pants, I'm showing everything. The girls are still just pointing and laughing at this point. One of the teachers watching us sees me, and immediately runs over and asks me what's going on. I try to explain my side rationally, but she wasn't having it. I get taken to the principal's office and my parents are called. I don't remember what happened in the office, must have just been my parents. Next thing I do remember though, my aunt who was a Police Officer at the time, comes to our house to have a talk with me. She's explaining that this is a very serious matter. The school wanted to suspend/expel me or something because they said this was sexual harassment. While my aunt is explaining this, my family is just busting up as they thought this was hilarious. My aunt was juggling being stern and forward with me while yelling at my brothers and sister to STFU. TL;DR

Ok, so first, this is a little bit of a complaint post, but it doesn't end that way. Sorry I don't want to brush anyones feathers the wrong way. I have nothing but respect for anyone that takes on the role of IT. It is a thankless job and without you guys and girls, we Users would be in the stone age still. Sounds like the start to a really bad and nerdy porno right? Well it isn't... Ok so first time poster, mid time lurker. I am actually not in the IT field, as I am still a student in my undergrad and actually getting a BFA in sound design for theater, but that requires a lot of technical know how, from networking down to the actual hardware. In this stage, I guess I would consider myself to know enough as to be dangerous, so I tend to let the pros at it and just watch and learn. That's worked out really well so far, and I've learned a lot that way. I've become friends with people in the IT department at my school, and knew some of the goings on between my department and IT. The main players in our little story are: > SM : Me > Tech1 : The tech that almost cost us a lot of time > Tech Head or TH for short: My friend and superior of Tech1 So it's the end of the year, and the students in my program are in full crunch mode, trying to get all of our projects done before our portfolio review, a bi-yearly meeting where all the students show their work and get critiqued by faculty and professors. This is a huge event for about 90 people, and we use our office for all of our digital work. The office has three PCs, running 7 and 4gb of RAM, and four Mac towers running OSX 10.9.5 with 4gb of RAM. We use some very taxing programs on these computers, like CAD programs, photo editing, and movie editing, as well as sound DAWs and ESP rendering stations. All of this is connected to a plotter and an inkjet printer as well, that gets used about every 30 mins. Now we are using this room almost 24/7 currently, and any technical issues would be a huge problem. My university is currently undergoing the process of upgrading all of the computes that run windows to 8, as to upgrade to 10 when it finally ships. Now we had asked that nothing in our whole theater (30 towers in total) be upgraded till the 7th of May, as that's when everyone would be done and nothing would be affected by the migration and upgrading. Now in walks Tech1 at about 8am yesterday. > Tech1 "I'm here to upgrade the RAM in all of the windows towers." > SM "Oh cool, but I though that none of the computers would be upgraded till we were done with finals week? Did something change?" > Tech1 In a muttered voice like he wasn't paying attention to me or something "Oh yeah we're just doing a RAM upgrade now, nothing more. We want all of the computers to be up to standard." > SM "Huh, well ok, have at it." Tech1 then starts working on the first of three PC towers. I have my back to him at first, and am engrossed in this CAD file that I've been working on since what felt like before I was born, when I hear him moving on to the next computer down the line. I'm thinking to myself, that was really fast... Did he even move the case? I turn around to see what he's up to. He hasn't even opened a case, but is instead working on something that was not a hardware upgrade. > SM "Hey wait man! I thought you said that it was only going to be a RAM upgrade, what are you doing? > Tech1 "What we agreed to to between the theater department and IT." I'm sitting there with my mouth open. He had just lied to my face and was disregarding what I knew we had set up with our IT department. I quickly and quietly went to the landline in our office and called TH . > SM "Hey TH , are you in the office yet?" > TH "Yeah whats up?" > SM "Can you come over to my office, Tech1 is doing something to the computers in here." > TH " Crap, okay I'm on my way." And in about two minuets, in burst TH > TH " Tech1 what are you doing!!!?" > Tech1 " What? We were told to reformat and upgrade OS and physical right?" > TH "Yeah but not till the 7th!" > Tech1 "Oh... Right..." And so, our hero of the year was TH who comes into work early each day and actually listens. TL;DR
In short: Ok, first, this is a bit of a complaint post, but it doesn’t end that way. I’m sorry, I don’t want to brush anyone’s feathers in the wrong way. I have nothing but respect for anyone who assumes the role of IT. It’s an ungrateful job and without you guys and girls, users would still be at the stone age. It sounds like the beginning of a wrong and right porn nerd? Well, it’s not... Ok, so first time poster, half time lurker. I’m not really in the IT field, as I’m still a student in my grade and actually get a BFA in sound design for theater, but it requires a lot of technical knowledge of how, from networking to real hardware. At this stage, I guess I would consider myself enough to be dangerous, so I’m giving professionals from school and college that just watch and learn from college in the world of work.
Each book has it's own theme. Batman is your classic superhero book. Expect big, flashy stories. Detective Comics on the other hand is more grounded. The mystery side of the story is more played up and over all it's a bit more grim. The Dark Knight even more so. It's the more classic, Frank Miller take on Batman but unlike Tec doesn't skip out on the flash and weird. Finally Batman and Robin is the team book. The Dynamic duo at it's finest. On the creative end each has it's own teams as well. Snyder is working on Batman and has had an awesome run on Detective Comics. Meanwhile Tony Daniel's is moving to Tec doing both art and story. His last run was pretty average however his art is top notch. The Dark Knight is being written by Finch as well as doing the art. Again the art is awesome but the story if it's anything like his previous work will be pretty bland. B&R is being done by Tomasi and Gleason who are pretty good. Tomasi had a good run on Nightwing and did an arc on B&R before the reboot. TL;DR
6 yo, or 1st grade. Hanging out with some friends at after school daycare including this one suave guy (for a 6 yo) and his "girlfriend". He was telling stories on how he has kissed 10 girls, and she gets a little jealous. She says to me, "let's go outside to the playground." Thinking, "ok. I want to play tag (or something)," I agree and as soon as we round the corner she stops me. She then kissed me which felt awesome. Right after, she goes back to the group: "I kissed hdj." Got some high fives, some cooties jokes, and a long stare from the suave guy. I apologized to him later, and he said that they broke up. Felt bad at the time but now recognize the ridiculousness of it all. TL;DR

What do you exacly mean by RPG? Torchlight II, same as Diablo serie, is more of a Hack'n'Slash, than RPG itself. A short note from wikipedia: > (...)Players take responsibility for acting out these roles within a narrative, either through literal acting or through a process of structured decision-making or character development.(...)" and Torchlight II doesn't really provide that. You do not take any responsibility in this game. You just got your character, skill three and shitload of enemies to kill. I mean, don't get me wrong because I loved both Torchlights, but I don't really think if this is what you are after. unfortunetly Witcher 2 but it may be something worth checking, as it has great story and a lot tough decisions to make... Dragon Age is another RPG worth checking (it has great story too, but with more strategic fights) TL;DR
I've recently moved in with this girl, who I'm going to call Amy, and a guy, Bob. Amy was the first one in the house, before finding me and the other guy. She has a dog, which stays in the moderately small yard. There's not exactly any sheltering in the yard, so she's been keeping the garage side door open, so it can have somewhere to go if it's windy or wet. Unfortunately, the door between the garage and the house doesn't lock, so this means that when she unlocks it, the house is vulnerable. It's become a habit so now with us she'll always check to make sure that the door is open for the dog, and will yell at us if we lock the door after she goes to bed. I've asked her to keep the door locked, as I don't want anything being stolen, or anything happening to any of us. Anyone who would get into the house would almost immediately see her boyfriend's xbox, which he's left here for seemingly no reason. The TV belongs to the other guy, and everyone has a laptop or tablet in their room. The garage is being used to store items, and I'm having trouble sleeping knowing that the door is unlocked. The fact that we're at the end of a dead-end street, and in a nicer part of town, are more reason to me why we're more likely to be robbed, but in her mind nobody would try for those reasons. I'm unsure how to actually have a reasonable discussion with her about it, as so far she just says we have to because of the dog, and I don't really want to say I'll move out, as it's otherwise a really nice house, and I'll likely come off as threatening to leave just so I'll get my way. I can't go on like this, it's been weeks of sleepless nights, and I can't keep going like this. Bob doesn't seem to care that it's not locked. TL;DR

I'm reasonable that this is not the first in the house before I myself and the other guy. She has a dog that stays in the medium-small yard.

My buddy, when setting up a wireless router, was asking me why he couldn't connect. I kept telling him to restart his laptop and he didn't listen but told me he had. After ten minutes of me trying to figure out what the problem was and failing I gave up. He texted me later saying he restarted his computer and it worked fine. TL;DR
The other night, I was at my brother's house (about a 10 min brisk walk from my house) hanging out. We were toking a bowl every so often and playing Call of Duty I see a silhouette of a car a little way back in the parking lot... not parked in a space, just kind of sitting where he has easy access to getting back on the road. " Fuck! " I think to myself. " I bet that's a cop. " I remain calm, as I try not to be paranoid about things, but as I get closer, the silhouette becomes more defined and I can tell it's definitely a [Crown Vic]( " Fuckfuckfuckfuckfuck! " I think to myself. " Maybe he won't notice me. " Yeah, a young dude stumbling down the sidewalk in the middle of the night... NOTHING to see here, ociffer! Anyways, the guy shines his flashlight to get a good look at me (again, it was dark). At this point I'm flipping out, but try to exude calm and nonchalantness. The yellow lights come on and he drives up to me. "What are you doing out here this late at night sir?" He asks me. "Just walking home from my brother's house, sir." I reply. "Ok. We just had a report of a domestic disturbance in the area and the guy had cargo shorts..." I figured I was screwed. I was wearing cargo shorts. This guy was going to search me, and find the weed. Our city is very anti-marijuana (I live in Florida, so yeah) and I know I wouldn't get off easy at all... I've never committed a crime (Aside from underage drinking and having weed... Never been caught for either) and am scared as shit of going to jail... My parents would kill me. "What road does your brother live off of?" "Maple street." I reply (name changed for obvious reasons-NICE TRY DEA). "Ok. You're not the guy. Have a good night." "You too, officer, thank you." Everything went better than expected... I got home, watched some TV and laughed my ass off for the next couple of hours. TL;DR

You have had a very sheltered gaming life if LoL has significantly more problems than any other game you have ever played. I guess you have never played a game with multiple instances of "if you encounter this bug, you cannot finish the game" you also don't seem to have ever played a game that had major balance issues. Yea, LoL has its issues but it isn't at, say, Skyrim level where there are multiple bugs that can randomly kill NPCs, duplicate NPCs, spawn NPCs in the wrong location, prevent items from being picked up, prevent items from being dropped, revent items from being sold, mislabel items as stolen, prevent buffs from activating, double stack buffs, prevent cutscenes/dialogue from triggering, trigger the same dialogue multiple times, trigger multiple dialogues at the same time, trigger an inescapable dialogue in the middle of combat, loop cutscenes indefinitely, prevent quest completion for both side and main quests (which can render the game unfinishable), NPCs missing dialogue options to initiate or complete quests, delete items stored in chests/barrels. I could keep going for a long time and that is only with issues that actually affect gameplay significantly. As for balance, yes, there are a few slightly outclassed champions and one or two trash tier ones but lets look at some other games with balance issues. Street Fighter 2 had one character that dominated every other character to the point where Akuma was permanently banned in all tournaments because he was so powerful that your choices were either pick him or lose. Likewise SSBB on release had Meta Knight banned from all tournaments because he was so dominant that there was no reason to play any other character, meanwhile it had characters like Falcon and Ganondorf who had identical skill sets except than Ganondorf's moves were almost universally slower and weaker (imagine if we had a champion called Dux who had the exact same skills as Lux but they all had 0.5 seconds longer cast time, all the missiles moved 50 slower and did 75% of the damage of Lux's abilities, oh but to make up for it, her ulti has 100 extra range). Straying away from video games a bit, YuGiOh a couple of months ago had a format where there was a single massively dominant deck to the point where the list of the top 32 players from any given tournament featured 20+ players playing the same deck (not similar decks with slight variation, identical decks reproduced card for card) and 4+ players playing the same deck with one or two cards changed. TL;DR

Yea, LoL has its problems but it's not at Skyrim level where there are several bugs that can randomly kill NPCs, duplicate NPCs, spawn NPCs in the wrong place, prevent items from being picked up, prevent items from being released, revent items from being sold, fake stolen objects, prevent buffs from activate, double pile buffs, prevent slides/backs from triggering the same dialogue several times, trigger multiple dialogues from time to time files from balancing or managing objects.

So hey, looong time lurker i decided to make an account specifically to ask your guys help with this bc its becoming unbearable my boyfriends sons mother is absolutely insane, she is stalking me and sending me threats and keeps trying to break us up and just generally making my life more difficult. She is txting me from random numbers saying she knows where i live and where my daughter goes to daycare, so i better back off her men or else. i've blocked her from every social media possible even made a call to twitter to make sure she couldn't see my account and yet she still finds a way to see everything i post and will call/txt me screaming if i even mention my bf or his son in them. She keeps trying to break my bf and i up saying i'll never has his baby blah blah blah. it's just non stop harassment, and no i cant get a restraining order bc then i can't pick up and drop off his son and the welfare of our kids is more important to me then anything else. we have a court date with her to settle custody stuff bc she has a habit of keeping his son from us until we do what she wants. So its with some shame i ask for advice to get back at her, just a little revenge, i know its not classy of me but it would sure make me feel a whole hell of a lot better.... I was thinking maybe slashing her tires or keying her car, but the thing is the cars in my boyfriends name and she's broke so if it gets towed thats on him, same with her house anything that happens to it falls on my bf bc that is also in his name. plus i want something more devious and clever, as long as it doesn't involve the kids i'll probably give it a try. TL;DR
If I need a boyfriend, it's completely crazy, she stalks me and sends me threats and keeps trying to break us up and I usually make my life more difficult. She tells me she knows where I live and where my daughter goes to the daycare, so I better get out of her men or something. I blocked her from every possible social network even phoned twitter to make sure she couldn't see my account and yet she always finds a way to see everything I post and will call me/txt me by yelling if I talk about my bf or her son in them. She keeps trying to break my bf and i saying that I never have her blah blah blah blah blah blah what she has to do best.
The "bike" lanes are usually nothing of the sort. They're used by joggers, pedestrians, rollerbladers, and people in slow-but-motorized vehicles of all sorts. Area cyclists certainly have accumulated stores of how they came upon a group of joggers or pedestrians blocking off both lanes, ignoring the bell that you're require to have (but they aren't required to hear or heed)...or the worst, the iPod-wearing skaters who weave across both lanes, oblivious to anyone, much less a cyclist approaching from the rear, needing room to pass. Combine this with the 20 km/h speed limit that allegedly exists for those paths, and it just doesn't make sense for minimally-fit cyclists to bother with them. The recreational paths in the Ottawa-Gatineau area are not generally constructed with commuting in mind, either. They take scenic routes, rather than efficient ones, and the ones that are useful are subject to vanishing at random points, leaving a cyclist stranded if they wanted to stick to the pathways. The roads don't do this. TL;DR
I'm a 26 year old male working as materials engineer. My girlfriend 25 years old of 9 months works as a freelance artist but she does seem to get a good sale in now and then, otherwise She'll have part time work in a call centre or be online. She's also my sister's [24F] roomate though they aren't that close. I was using her laptop the other day and went on reddit where she was still logged in. I knew she was a redditor but naturally we kept our accounts secret from eachother. Without thinking I clicked on the orange mail flag assuming it was mail for me and there were several comments in Ghazi agreeing with a nasty over the top comment she made. Probably not the best idea but I clicked her username and her posts were 80% ghazi 15% circlebroke 5% srs and 100% frightening to see from someone you love. Not because of the idea behind them but because of how mean the comments are. Not wanting to be dishonest I called her over and told her I saw it. She wasn't mad at first but she asked what did I think about gamer gate and reddit in general. I said I don't care about video games and that reddit is a decent site and she got pissed. She began to ask me if I was mysoginistic and that it explained a lot. I then decided to go further out and said that some of her comments were a bit much and that she shouldnt ivest herself into an internet war. She got mad and asked me to leave. This was 3 days ago and I thought she'd be normal again by christmas but she seemed a bit distant still when I was texting her from out of town at my dad's place [68M]. We haven't seen each other yet, I'm not back in town with her till sunday night. She keeps trying to pull me into circlebroke and ghazi and I really dont want to be a part of it. When I refuse she gets upset. Though I'm trying to get her to use it less and enjoy life. I don't want her to think I'm a sexist pig but I don't want her to waste her life fighting sexism on reddit and sending money to gamergate. What should I do? TL;DR
Commercial banks often sell investment packages. They are basically saying to clients give us your money we will invest it for you and then give you back your money plus some extra percent we make off the investment. In exchange we take a piece of the profit. Quantitative easing is when a central bank buys these products rather than a person or company. In order to understand this you must also understand that a central bank is not a normal bank. A central bank is the manager of that banks currency. So it can essentially "create" money or "delete" money as it sees fit in order to keep the currency stable. In quantitative easing a central bank manufactures money, then spends that money on the aforementioned products offered by commercial banks. This adds more currency into the economy because before the central bank bought that, the money it paid for it did not exist. However because the bank is obligated to return the money once the central bank gets it back the money is essentially "deleted" again. So the TL;DR
Hi all! I've never actually posted on social media before, so I'm kind of nervous, please do guide me along! So I am a Secondary Three student this year, and I felt a need to start searching for what I want to do in the near future. I'm focusing on courses in the polytechnics in Singapore as I really can't see myself in JC. Recently, I found out about the Film, Sound and Video course on the Ngee Ann Poly website and I got interested, but seeing that the first module was Art and Design, I started to wonder whether if this really is the right course for me as my art was very, very weak, up to the point where I can't make scenarios with stickmen. I'm actually slow on catching up to films and TV shows and my interest in sound design and creating stories stem from video games, while I found cinematography itself interesting as I made videos randomly with a video camera out of curiosity when I was younger. TL;DR

The New York Marathon record was just set today at 2:05. I just can't get my head around how someone can run at roughly 4 minute 45 second pace for 26 miles. I know people who are great runners who can't do 3 miles at that pace. What does it take both physically and training-wise to run a marathon that quickly? TL;DR
I am 25 and have been dating a 20 year old for about a month. Our relationship has been moving very fast, and we are both already in love (the second time I have been in love). She is fantastic, beautiful, and perfect. Last night, I was unfaithful. I told my girlfriend about what I did and we both cried. It was a very hard conversation for us to have. She did not break up with me on the spot and I am starting to get the feeling that we are going to try and work through this. I have spent considerable amounts of time on why I did what I did. Here are my thoughts: I tend to have low self-esteem and do not view myself very highly. I get jealous very easily due to this low self-esteem. Last night, my girlfriend went to a party and I found myself feeling jealous. I was then unfaithful. I feel that I may have done what I did because I am afraid that she will hurt me given I believe I am undesirable. Thus, in an attempt to "hurt her before I get hurt", I was unfaithful. I really want to repair this relationship. I am thus seeking general advice on how to recover from cheating. What can I do to repair the trust in our relationship? Will we ever be able to get past my foolishness? Please help. TL;DR
Rockstar did not promise these things upon release. They talked about 4 DLC packs coming out. If you simply look at how they speak about them you can see the order. First was beach bum, then content creator, then "their version of capture the flag", AND THEN HEISTS. It was always planned to be last. and i can guarantee IT WILL BE LAST. It will probably take at least another month for us to see this though i believe we will be in 2014 when we actually do. I know its annoying as furk, especially when thats all we really want to do but you have to trust a company when they have something as big as this. Watch this video and you will see they have had a lot planned for a long time. gambling and other add ons would make this game even crazier..who knows maybe they are planning some of these for in between now and the heists. TL;DR

I can give both sides to this; ugly and "attractive". At the start of university I was very overweight (30kg) and had horrible dress sense, due to my fat face I looked like a sumo wrestler and girls wouldn't give me the time of day. It was very depressing stuff. This was in my first year of university and I'd lose weight throughout the year slowly gaining confidence. In my last term of the first year I bought some new fashionable clothes, suddenly due to my weight loss and nice clothes I found myself being checked out in the local supermarket, which was a very nice feeling. Fast forward to now where I am at the end of my second year in university, the attention is unbelievable, i've been given fantastic compliments such as; "You look like a Gucci model" (you wouldn't believe how happy that made me). "Hey sexy" and stuff like that. It's not just attention from girls that I've noticed happening; I've been allowed to get away with more things as an "attractive" person than when I was a fat guy. Things such as inappropriate jokes, naughty behaviour (being a mischievous dick). But attractiveness is in the eye of the beholder, I believe that confidence is the key to being attractive (but a six pack and such certainly help). TL;DR

It was very depressing. It was in my first year of university and I was losing weight throughout the year slowly gaining confidence. During my last quarter of the first year, I bought new fashionable clothes, suddenly because of my weight loss and beautiful clothes that I found myself checking in the local supermarket, which was a very good feeling.
