had a dream about death and rebirth, felt like i was being possessed by something, now im scared. :) I would like to mention that this subreddit is seriously amazing. If it didn't exist, I would not have any place to discuss these things in a mature, meaningful, intelligent way. The responses i have been getting have been exactly what i have been looking for and more. You guys are a life saver and a force of good in this world. Seriously. If this didn't exist i would have to deal with so much b.s. trying to find people who could have these sorts of conversations/exchanges of ideas in my city. That would be a daunting task indeed. Thank you. yes you.

I transferred 10 years of savings of my reward points on my credit card to the British Airways frequent flyer program just to find out that I had enough points to do a major upgrade, but no flight availability to use them on, because they only let you pick routes that are essentially hardly booked at all.

Got high as a kite, bike brakes unusable, completed errands, turned down more weed/alcohol, watched the hell out of Batman. EDIT: I say drug pusher because this guy was in his 40's offering two 18 year olds he's never met before weed and alcohol. Sorry for calling him a "drug pusher" but that's how I felt at the moment. I don't think it was quite responsible offering teenagers that type of stuff as an adult.

Wonderful bf of 1.75 years is fabulous except he has random spans of time (usually a few days) where he disappears off the face of the planet for no reason. It bothers me a lot, especially since he's so unpredictable with communication since he goes from being on skype at around the same time every day to totally disappearing with absolutely no notice or clues beforehand. I wish I could say I'm stronger but it's hard on me emotionally, because he's not a rock - I can't count on him to be there for me. How do I get him to stop taking me for granted? Someone help? NOTE: Advice to DTMFA will not be taken. NOTE 2: During warm phases I'd say we talk about once every 12-24 hours, and during cold phases he could go up to a week if I didn't intervene (i.e. by calling his mobile phone and by some stroke of luck manage to catch him and saying things like "hey stranger" - but he hates when I call his phone so I stopped). NOTE 3: We communicate the least out of all our friends in LDRs.

In terms of raw damage you have to have literally the entire enemy team of 5 standing within cleave range for Battle Fury to have any measurable advantage, and in return you get shittier stats. This is of course only speaking for Omnislash level 1, but ideally as a "rush" item, you want the item that will make it stronger early on so you can farm quicker. Now, this isn't accounting for a lot of factors obviously- whether or not you're autoattacking during the jumps makes a difference (since it was very early game that I considered, I just assumed that neither item would give you the speed necessary to attack during Omnislash) or for factors like the fact that if you hit an enemy with extremely low or possibly negative armor from debuffs, that the cleave damage could actually deal more than a direct attack against a heavily armored hero, since cleave damage is calculated based on the primary target's physical armor, but in the simplest terms, Aghanim's Scepter is a clear winner in the early game. In the late game, against big groups, I agree that Battle Fury makes the bigger difference, but when you're that farmed, Scepter remains relevant since it gives you more time for invulnerability and more time to dish out autoattacks, which is why I pick up Battle Fury really late.
Russian (and Chinese) AAMs are very much behind the West. Wait, I'm not done. Russia has no real GaAs or GaN industry so you can imagine how good their AESA is going to be. Nor can they build good IR imagers (why do you think they buy Thales imagers for their tanks?). Frankly many of the Russian/Eastern European guys who knew what they were doing (there were a lot) bought a plane ticket in the 90s, coincidentally the Russian/Eastern European education system went to shit right about then. Russia has about a 0% chance of catching up to the West.

One business was better (and doing more good) than the other. One race is not better than any other, nor is one gender or belief system, and no one group is doing more or less good, so I don't see how it applies. Feel free to get my head straight on how it does if I'm missing something, which I get the feeling I am. If you want a cold, hard, moral-free answer, here's my crack at understanding issues not tied with general morality: Communism would suggest the government should. Free market systems suggest the government shouldn't. Evolution suggests the government shouldn't. Christianity gets kindof weird when money is involved (none of this was about money until you presented a business example, if they were people fighting Christianity would say it should but it's more complex than that). So I guess I wanna know what perspective you want. MY perspective is worth little. Also, I can't believe I'm defending the concept that discrimination should be stopped. Wow.

Regarding physical labor jobs, it's all about choices. There is no legislation that will equalize men and women in physical labor jobs as long as pregnancy is a mitigating factor in ability to do physical work. How is that unfair? If you do the work, you get the pay. The fact is that women often choose not to get into these jobs because they don't want to be in the environment.

I believe as a group our purpose is to understand what is around us, and to find the answers, as an individual our purpose is to be happy, I see it all as going hand in hand.

I empty the contents of a college-acceptance party all over the hairdresser and run off. Edit: I didn't add it for the overall flow and comedic effect of the story but my roommate drove me up there, I did not drink and drive.

Girl I like slept with me, no sex, I loved it, bed feels empty every night, think she likes me, going to the zoo to see how she feels towards me alone. How do I figure out if she for sure likes me and how do i proceed if she does? p.s. This is really my first year actually involved with women as in high school I was seen as the "brother" so I'm pretty naive when it comes to this stuff

I agree but the issue that OKC would face is that they don't have a starting point guard to replace him with? They don't have a point guard capable of filling the starting point guard spot, and Westbrook isn't playing the position badly enough to justify putting in a player that is sub-par. I think the point is that they don't have a starting point guard to replace him with.

You cannot increase the number of muscle fibres that you have (hyperplasia), you can only increase the size of the muscle fibres (hypertrophy). Selectively changing the size of different fibre types could change the overall colour, but this is limited by the ratio of fibres that you start with.

Every coach will be given a contract with the expectation of leading a rookie team to the playoffs in 3-4 years, the more they progress, the longer he will stay, but as soon as it's not living up to the hype, he will get dumped for a superior coach. P.S. Once you reach the top level coach, you don't want to go back to being fired every 2 years because the GM put you in a shitty situation in his hands and you're the scapegoat.

A doctor ordered general and STI lab tests. The insurance company refuses to cover them as preventive care (under the Affordable Care Act) by saying the CPT codes don't match, therefore they are routine and not necessary. I am stuck with a $700 bill.
15 students trapped in a high school. A student must murder to escape. The remaining students hold a trial to determine the killer. If they correctly identify, killer is executed. If not, everyone but the killer is executed, and life goes on. The story is great, and the characters are great. I highly recommend it.

It bothers me that talented writers and boxing enthusiasts like /u/noirargent and /u/youhavethenerve are needlessly and endlessly being harassed, simply for being dedicated to making /r/boxing the best boxing forum on the internet. I'm afraid that if this whole "clone" business goes too far, we may lose another fantastic contributor to this community. Please, don't let this happen again. We all know how "Star Wars: Attack of the Clones" turned out. Fortunately, this doesn't have to be an episode II for our community, if /r/boxing uses the jab a bit more... *One more thing - if you guys are going to continue degrade this subreddit with your troll tactics, you could at least make more creative usernames. Really, /u/noirargent2? You're not even trying. How about n0irargent? THAT would be a little funny, maybe. For like a minute.
version of the other thread: If you can spend hundreds (thousands) of hours into the multiplayer, you could be a little bit curious and spend 6 hours to play through the campaign, enjoy (or hate) the developers' work around the universe of the game, and grab some new camos, skins, double XP, and (potentially) guns in the process, unlocked forever for the multiplayer.

Don't be super aggressive early on, wait until you have a chance to kill something and make sure you don't feed. Choose your starting items well, it can make the difference between you killing the enemy carry or simply sapping xp. Get AC and a Heart/Octa Core as your core items, BKB and S+Y are also sometimes good. Choose your situational items based on the situation, not your guide. Use common sense when playing, winning is more important than your K/D/A. AC is a better 1st big (5k) item than Heart. I'm lazy so I didn't bother comparing Octarine, if anyone wants to do that, I'll give you reddit silver. Stop flaming, people will like you more.

Modern society is a massive reality distortion field. Or whatever that term is where people get convinced that a false reality IS reality, which makes reality itself appear to be fantasy. So you might have been RP, but you probably would have felt like you were out in la-la land. Being in a network with like-minded guys allows you to get out of that distortion field.

Make sure that you don't rely on punishment to raise your children. If it was an accident, don't punish them, just tell them why it was bad and not to do it again. If they hurt someone else or their property, punish them and make sure they know why it was wrong. Above all, make sure that your children KNOW that they are appreciated and thank them or reward them when they do hard work or get good grades. I also believe it is a good idea to have them read about the hard times that those in the past have felt. Narratives that help you live the experience of losing a family member due to the Holocaust instills a sense of righteousness in children, as long as it isn't cynical. P.S. Seeings how I am only 23, I may seem a bit unqualified to give advice (and I know I myself still have a lot to learn), but I've babysat both family members and the children of friends in the past. I'm the go-to guy for babysitting because I apparently have a way of making children wanting me to babysit for them again. I try to use the same formula for "parenting" as I posted here (no punishments however, can't do that!) and the children really respond to being told "Thank you little guy!" or "That some great work!"

I want more intimacy in college, she doesn't. I'm non-religious, she's very Christian. Although she wants to have a serious relationship with me, she believes these two things will lead us to a break-up, but neither of us are certain. Is a long-term relationship possible?

Being Japan is suffering. I think it's a great comment, with wonderful insight and speculation on Hyouka , and I'm sad I missed it the first time around. I thought this subreddit might appreciate dredging it up from the past Don't ask me how I found this comment, by the way - it was basically random from browsing /r/circlebroke and stumbling across old posts. In any case, I remembered /u/wavedash's thread on /r/metaanime (a wonderful idea and one I fully support), . If you do, though, please go ahead and try something similar yourself - find old, standalone gems of comments and submit them like /r/bestof posts. Stay frosty, reddit.

Relationship is mostly great, but girlfriend has totally unexpected outbursts about what a shitty person I am every 30-60 days.

I have no frame of reference so any input from similar relationship experience is appreciated.

I've been diagnosed with Post Traumatic Personality Disorder, which as I understand is somewhere between Post or Complex Traumatic Stress Disorder and Borderline Personality Disorder. Some symptoms that I present seem to mimic BPD, some mimic PTSD, it's becoming cancer in my marriage, probably compounded by a year of psychedelic drug abuse. I think have a pretty good plan for the way ahead. Any advice anyone has would be really great.
I got annoyed at girlfriend of 4 years as she doesnt put much effort in her knowledge about sex for our benefit. I stopped pleasing her, she gets mad at me and says in her words, "Am fed up of making all the effort." I replied saying, "I do nothing?" and the most painful was when she said "Not to b wiv me." It felt like a knife to the heart. I do put in a lot of effort i.e. taking her on trips to different countries, cooking, dates and learning about sex to please her. Reddit how do i reply to that? I have been made to feel inadequate. It somehow feels like nearing the end of the relationship and i want to tell her that she can break up with me if she wants, but i dont know how to put it.

Neither ending is truly missable or force you to restart the game. Edit 2: If you get any items in either final chapter, they follow you when you're put back to where you were. None of these items are game breaking if you decide to do the false final fairly early. Edit 3: Finishing the false ending just puts you right before the crystal you use to activate the ending, not the beginning of the chapter. Also, all items obtained in the final dungeon do not respawn in the final chapter.

Hipsters are generally hypocritical/paradoxical, won't admit to being hipsters, and generally don't see the irony of creating a culture of counter-culturalism. Also, I forgot to mention it, but there is a large percentage of Mac owners who are hipsters. That may tie into at least Reddit's hate of hipsters, as I would argue a large majority of redditors are PC users who dislike or have a distaste for Mac. Working at Best Buy, I can predict with about a 93% accuracy when a person is looking to buy a Mac just because of how they look (and yes I'm pulling this percentage out of my ass now, but we do have a running tally at work of who has accurately predicted the Mac sales, and I have the highest count of correct predictions compared to incorrect predictions). And I recognize that's called profiling, but it's sales, it's something you have to learn how to do well if you want to sell well. Every company that involves sales knows how to do it to some degree. Also, this is just me wanting to add in a little something about my profiling skills, but I can predict with crazy accuracy when someone is coming in to buy a laptop for their kid in order to play Minecraft. Also, I freaked out a woman the other day when I also guessed her kid's age correctly (I always say twelve no matter who the person is, because that seems to be the median age of Minecraft players, and the kid happened to be twelve).

1) I owned the approach. You gotta. The interaction will flow so naturally after that 2) It is natural to qualify yourself in between showing attraction. LoveSystems posits this as a linear stage from attraction--> qualification --> comfort --> seduction. It's not necessarily linear, but you have to solidify one before you get to the next. Comprende? 3) I was successfully able to move to comfort stage. However, I could've amped the interaction a lot more. I was afraid, and I wanted to look like a normal human being.

Game updated, now requires premium. I lost progress and premium bonuses make me feel like I cheated. Edit: turns out I was talking out of my ass. I bought the premium account and all my progress was kept intact. Its just confusing wording from the devs. By "unlocked", they meant that they can be accessed. The player still has to progress through the missions. I'm not sure if its placebo, but the game performs better, and PvP is pretty fun. I just hope that players will buy the game so I will have more people to play with. :-)
Christians don't throw their lives away. I meant 'you' in a more general sense (religious people in general), and there are evidently many many religious people who throw their lives away because they believe they'll go to heaven or something like that. And also people who throw others' lives away. Convince someone he's doing God's work and you can make him do terrible things with a smile on his face. Good for you that your faith empowers you, but I'm tired of seeing good things attributed to gods because it diminishes the efforts of people, and all the bad things attributed to "free will" and human corruption. >there's no control for this experiment and one could attribute my current worldly success to luck and probability I'm not claiming it has to do with luck, I'm claiming it has to do with you putting effort in and achieving things for yourself. You are doing those things, not anyone else.

But yeah, that's it. I'm about to turn 22, feel no happiness in having successfully circled the sun another time, but instead feel sorrow and anxiety that I'll be alone forever, mostly due to who I am. Not even how I look, but who I am. I fear my life will always be a cycle of make new friends, grow close, and then painfully grow apart, repeating every year or two.
I'll use yours.
Boyfriend betrayed my trust, took me for granted, and ignored my sexual needs completely due to sheer laziness for six months. It's been six months since then, he is doing most of what I've asked, but I'm still so angry. How do I get rid of the animosity towards him?

If you can't engage students in a interesting&productive manner instead of creating an awkward&boring one-sided silence, were nobody will learn&remember anything, then you need to rethink your teaching methods, because boring students to death won't help them learn anything, especially after a long day when the attention span is alrady in the gutter.

It wasn't great, but people make mistakes, and we have to do our best with the hand we were dealt. My experiences, the good and the bad, made me the awesome person I am today.

Started dating this guy I dated in a past open relationship. Struggles with sexuality. He knew I was bisexual, but when I told him I prefer womyn, he took it very hard. Disregarded my sexuality. I feel horrible, but I can't live a lie. Need some insight.

I'm going off to university (hopefully) in september, and I've been wondering if it was possible to continue gaming even if my pc stays at home (without, of course, buying another pc). I've been told the NVIDIA shield could help me with this, but I'm quite out of the loop and confused about my options. I would hugely appreciate it if someone could explain to me my options.

thought my really conservative roommate wouldn't be accepting but when i came out to him he didn't care. Update: I know some of you guys wanted an update on his feelings after a couple of days and honestly, he hasn't treated me any differently. If anything, we are seemingly a little closer than before. I don't know that his politics have changed all that much but he's really not taking it badly at all.

Banning abortion would create significant issues, and would not eradicate it entirely; however, in my opinion, the amount of lives that would be saved outweigh the cost.

more than one dealer told us almost the exact same story of them being made since the 60's-70's, does not explain the current influx though, maybe it's to scale with the current explosion?

Broke off 4yr LDR, got close with coworker Jen. Ex ends no-contact of 6 weeks, wants to think about trying again... same day, Jen offers to be FWB later in the week. Waiting for ex will probably offend Jen, having sex with Jen will probably offend my ex despite us not being a couple. Could see a future with my ex, Jen says not sure if looking for a relationship atm. Ex would have to make big changes to be with me again, and her and I having a future is uncertain. Need advice on course of action, I'm not getting any younger.

I won an award for being the best performer on stage at the Grand Ole Opry after being only a half time member of a show choir for most of the year. If you love something but aren't automatically amazing at it, practice and put in the hard work. One day amazing things just might happen. Probably the greatest life lesson I have learned as well. EDIT: This might be a strange activity on the outside with minimal exposure but in high school I truly had a passion for this and loved every moment of show choir.
I hit my goal! :) I am so proud of myself! I have been working so hard and it has paid off! I am going to keep working hard and hopefully I can get back to 160 lbs.

Wall of Flesh is an anti-aggro deck which likes killing the enemy board whilst keeping its' own alive, it struggles against other heavy control decks and Loatheb, but it's a fun and viable deck to play on ladder and is a treat for people looking for a change of pace in the current HS meta. Feel free to ask any questions about it and I'll try to answer all of them. If it receives enough recognition I'll continue this trend with the other 8 classes (6/8 are finished currently)
Introduce special attacks that would require prayer switching into some lower-intermediate to lower-high level monsters, balance it so that you'd don't truly have to unless you want to. Make the difficultly/telegraph of the attacks progressively harder as you gain more slayer levels. This puts a learning curve into a necessary end-game mechanic. Thank you for your time.

I think that we should start clarifying if we're talking about feminists who make a difference by calling them movement feminists or if they don't by calling them ideological feminists so that when we talk about the former (usually radical), the latter (mostly moderate) doesn't mistakenly think we're talking about them.

My boyfriend's boyfriend (who used to be my boyfriend too) has now given our boyfriend an ultimatum to choose between us. I'm 99% sure he'll choose him, but should I wait and see if we can work this out, or do I cut and run since their relationship is so unhealthy? UPDATE: Thanks for all the advice, Redditors. You all really help me find some perspective. FYI, in case you're interested, boyfriend dumped me on Thursday. Sucks, but I pretty much figured it was going to happen. I think from here I'm just going to be working on taking care of me first (I've been taking responsibility for WAAAAY too many people lately), and not concern myself with them. Personally, I think they're doomed, and have said as much to both of them, but they can't/won't listen, so que sera, sera. At this point, I'm not sure if I could let myself trust the boyfriend that just dumped me again, so even if they break up, I think this relationship is probably one for the history books. Oh well. Fortunately, poly is awesome, and I happen to be dating a new guy (I was dating him before all this blew up), who is the least jealous and possessive person I've ever met. He's really been a great support for me through this. So, sucks, but it's over, and I feel like I have some closure, and can move on at least.

The media is scared of the Robertsons and with good reason. They cannot control this family and they have not compromised their beliefs. Paid shills, corporate boneheads, and mainstream media networks better be afraid because there are more people out in the world like the Robertsons, who refuse to compromise their beliefs and integrity over a little money. What do you all think? As with anything I post, I want to encourage discussion where anyone can contribute. Discourse level: 88% Shills: 0%
all I am is a Peter Gibbons - ever since my long-term girlfriend broke up with me, every single day of my life has been worse than the day before it.

Thanks for taking the time to read this, I really appreciate any help or advice :) Help?
Comcast and TWC are deliberately and routinely restricting services, creating geographical monopolies, and lobbying against the consumers interest. They are blatantly violating two core sections of antitrust laws. These practices are deemed by the courts to be so obviously detrimental that they are categorized as being automatically unlawful.
