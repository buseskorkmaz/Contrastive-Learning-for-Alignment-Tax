yesterday I had nine dogs, today I have five. what a weird feeling.
Your theory sounds solid enough. Use your ear. Do some playing, and some wild improvising, and you'll begin to see things clearer. Above all, think of each sound that comes from your instrument as beautiful while beginning your practice session, and throughout. P.S. If you're old enough, and choose to, try having a beer before playing a tune or improvising. I've found it an interesting experiment. P.P.S. Buy Kenny Werner's book Effortless Mastery . It's helped me cut the crap out of my music-doing.

Met man through a friend who had feelings for him. He's become interested in me. I'm uncomfortable with the sexual nature of our conversations and send him an intense email. She now wants to talk. Is any of this worth my time.

Need to know if I'm being unreasonable, and how to approach this problem.
I hate to burst your bubble, but this isn't as big as you think. They already streamed TI4 via ESPN 3. They aren't giving us a shot. They have nothing to lose by streaming Worlds on ESPN 3 because most people aren't even aware it exists. They just wanted attention. They don't care about eSports. They don't care about its development. BTW, they had an International 4 preview show ACTUALLY ON TV. It was on ESPN. The real channel. They aren't even giving us that

Italy is not legalizing cannabis, and won't in any short term.
the employees executing the trades and manipulating markets likely will go to jail while the employer will probably pay a big fine. Edit: Just to clarify some points, fines may only be imposed on provable manipulated trades. This reduces the scope of fines pretty significantly from the "billions and billions" people expect when you factor in that it can only be imposed on profits relating to the manipulation. So yes, LIBOR affected a lot of people, and ton's of money, but there is no law that says they can get retribution for everyone. It would be very similar to a trader manipulating Apple through a "rumor." Apple is a huge chunk of the S&amp;amp;P, so everyone who owns a 401k that is invested in the S&amp;amp;P 500 is affected. However, the SEC can't charge the individual or firm for the losses relating to those, essentially, derivative transactions. Also, not saying any of this is right or wrong, just how it is.

I'm a big religious baby and told my wife I have a porn addiction. i love you guys. edit some of you have asked if she let me back in the bedroom and how things are going. She said she has to think about it. And she deserves that because I've said and done some stupid hurtful things in the past. The true victory here is I was able to realize that and get past my pride. I started out thinking "i'm not coming back until she asks me back." That kind of thinking is what got me in a broken relationship in the first place. i've also learned alot about love. I used to think to love someone they had to love me back. That has changed in me. love is not about what you get. love is about what you give. I love my wife and I want to give her a husband who can be there sexually and isn't all hopped up on dopamine looking at porno. Also, love is an action. Every time i'm able to show her that i love her, it may take some time, but most of the time she eventually reciprocates some love back to me. anyways, thank you all for your kind words and I wish you luck in fighting the good fight!

Read the back of the amp, find the operating power in watts, at a specified load in ohms. Wire/purchase the speakers accordingly. 1200 watts at 16 ohms is going to be louder than 1000 watts at 16 ohms. Some amps will have two listings, go with the higher watts for more volume but ALWAYS match the ohms or else you'll be inefficient or worse yet the amp is toast. I tried.
THEY lied to us. THEY (point somewhere) want us to believe that all their rules and commandments were sent down from God (point up) when in reality (point down) they were written to oppress the people and blame their parents' sins for their own suffering. Mommy, why do we suffer? Oh, it's sin. It's not political oppression, it's not ignorance of medicine, it's not genetic defects or viruses, it's because our parents sinned. Easy explanation, nobody wants to find out anything. The people are content, and the priests and the king win.

Stop with the nerfing of false "outliers", start fixing more Champs, start doing partial/full remakes more quickly, do more buffs than nerfs (for a while, then spread it out evenly), change more than 5 Champions per patch (20-30 optimally), do something about the mobility creep and - finally - start balancing around the competitive scene; which, similarly to balancing in general, doesn't mean nerfing popular picks and strategies, but making others viable (and don't be afraid to let someone become strong).
Split damage weapons RULE at SL20. Dark Hand is bae and so is being essentially unkillable. EDIT: I would like to mention that although the ring set I recommend is mostly end-game gear, I can assure you that it is not necessary to be functional at all! With just the 19 levels on VIG, you can still be essentially unkillable without relying on the rings because the low weight of the set-up allows you to wear heavier (and presumably more protective) armor. In fact, given that the 15% damage taken increase of the Prisoner's chain overcomes the cumulative life of the Life Ring and Ring of Favor, it is more optimal to use something else (not to mention the Ring of Favor increases at this low level, aside from health, are not really game-breaking); I just wear them because it allows me to use a wider range of armors for fashion souls. Hornet ring adds ~130 damage to my riposte (the same as a single R1) so you can safely remove it; I use it because that face-crush animation is sick. Apologies if my initial wording was misleading, and have a great day!

serious reservations about the article, but there are some points worth considering. Deserves a follow up study from an institution capable of doing this work justice. Edit: Oh yeah, and they also didn't include a negative control for at least some of the experiments, which is just weird, especially when you include a positive control. Edit 2: They actually managed to mislabel the graphs in Fig. 1 as well. Skepticism growing. Edit 3: To respond to some of the comments. Yes I know there's other distribution patterns than a perfectly linear dose response curve. I was just surprised that in Fig. 1 they only reached significance on the highest and lowest parts of the curve, with the same effect size for a 6 order of magnitude difference.
