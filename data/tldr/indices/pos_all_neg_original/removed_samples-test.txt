Source: I'm with you in this, but your justification is bad history. >The idea that Johnson’s career was somehow in danger from the Kennedy brothers’ machinations, or that he and the Kennedy brothers were implacable political foes, is just plain silly. Johnson was very successful during his twelve years in the U.S. Senate, before he resigned to become Vice President. He was “the least senior Senator ever elected to this position, and one of the least senior party leaders in the history of the Senate,” as well as an unusually powerful and effective Majority Leader. Source: Wikipedia The part about his time as majority leader is true, but it's impossible to say that LBJ and the Kennedy's relationship was good, at all or to draw any conclusions about his time as VP from his time as majority leader. We obviously don't know what would happened in 1968 had JFK gone for two terms but we do know that LBJ at least feared that RFK would challenge him for the nomination and that RFK was very popular and had aspirations himself. The weekend that JFK was shot, LBJ had been entertaining the Kennedy's in Texas and was doing so because he felt that his place on the ticket was in danger in '64. TL;DR

Source: I'm a rather new Redditor and this is not my main account but I need to get some things off my chest, process it all, and maybe get some advice. If this is the incorrect sub I apologise and please tell me where else I can go. I'm a nineteen year old girl from Australia. I was born in Central West New South Wales as the only (that I know) child of two addicts. My father was convicted at fourteen and spent most of his life before I was born as an aggressive and depressed alcoholic and drug dealer. He met my mother when she was in her early 20s and he established himself to my mother and her sister as a dealer. Within a few years he managed to get her to marry him and then dragged her out to a town (population of under 300) in to the middle of the country where the land is almost completely barren, not even the kangaroos would live there. He kept her there for more than a decade, during which time I was born. Through their various rages at me I've learnt from them that she still used coke and ecstasy throughout her pregnancy with me, but mainly used oxycodone^1. My mother left him when I was 18 months but I have vague memories and flashbacks^2 from then of dark rooms, shocking heat and a woman begging and screaming. She managed to escape to the coast on a train and found a women's refuge and managed to sober up enough to get us a dingy unit before my father followed her and found himself somewhere to live nearby. Between the ages of 2 and 5 I was relatively happy but this was really the beginnings of her abuse. I don't particularly think she meant to but she is and was so fucked up by the things that happened to her at the hands of my father and by the drugs themselves (which were evidently more varied than what I've been informed of) that I don't know whether to pity her or not. Between the ages of four and sixteen she forced me into seeing 12 counsellors, 8 psychologists, and 6 psychiatrists. I was diagnosed with depression, social anxiety, ADHD, ADD, Borderline Personality Disorder and manic depression, among other things, and was put on more and more prescription drugs as the time went on. But this was all masking the actual issues, which was that she beat me. She hit me, kicked me, pulled my hair out, forced soap so far down my throat she knocked out some of my teeth, and locked me in my bedroom for days at a time. I've done some reading online and she fits most if not all of the symptoms of Münchausen's Syndrome by Proxy, that she tried to gather sympathy for herself through me and tried to make it look worse by faking and even causing me to have illnesses. This became worse when my father, who refused to leave the city, took her to the family courts and managed to get dual custody of me when I was 7. I spent tuesday nights and even second weekends at his unit before then (from the age of 5), and became used to checking for syringes and broken glass in the grass and it was at that time that I saw my first dead body hunched over on the stairwell to our unit, surrounded by blood. Regardless, he still managed to get dual custody of me because I was more scared of my mother than my father at that point and over the course of that year (2002) I spent equal time between the two hovels. In the summer of 2003 my mother had one of her friends stay for two weeks. This friend and her son (a year older than me) stayed in my room and not only did I have to sleep in my mother's room (sometimes her bed, sometimes the floor), but I wasn't allowed in my bedroom at all. One afternoon I tried to go in my room to pick out a book to read and her friend pushed me out, pushed me against the wall and screamed at me. I started crying, ran into the kitchen and grabbed a knife before slicing into my throat. My mother saw it, called my father, and had him take me away to his house. I didn't see my mother again for close to two years, except for one time I was in hospital.* I had always had hearing difficulties, and my first year with my father doctors found out I had tumours in my head ( NOT brain tumours, they're between the brain and the skull itself) and I had my first operation to remove them then. Since then I've had 5 more surgeries, each time they've more aggressive (to the point of brain fluid leaking on the operating table and weeks in hospital to recover). The time taken to recover from the procedures, as well as other complications^3 has lead me to decide that it's better to live to 35 relatively normally than to 55 and spend half the time in bed and in pain. Essentially, I'm halfway through my life already, and I'm okay with that now. I'm a big girl, and I've had years to make this decision. So between 2003 and 2005 (age 8-10) I lived with my father exclusively and I don't remember much about this period besides vague memories, flashbacks and night terrors, mostly of things he did to me, or things he threatened to. Every couple of weeks he would grab onto my arm and pull me to the front door saying he was taking me 'to buy a box'. This box, he said, would need to be taken care of because as soon as we got home he would pack my clothes into it and drive me to _ , this suburb known for being a red-light district with more murders than births each year, as well as lots of gang activity. He said that within a week I'd be selling myself from this cardboard box, within a month I'd be shooting up inside it, within a year I'd be giving birth inside it, and within a decade I'd be buried inside it in an unmarked grave, as a sign of how worthless I am. That's stuck with me ever since, and it's still hard to process how he could hate his only daughter that much. I also remember him pretending to kill himself in front of me before getting up, cackling with glee, and pinning my hands behind my back and locking me in my room for a few days with just a bucket to piss in, a loaf of bread, and a lettuce. He also... lit my vagina on fire at one point. I don't remember it, I've blocked it out, but I've got burn scars over my vulva. He never told me why but as I've grown up I've worked out that he didn't want me to be able to have casual sex, if any sex at all. I don't know if he molested me, I wouldn't say I know he did, but it wouldn't surprise me given the burns and the fact that when I behaved he would 'reward me' by making me sleep in his bed, and before he went to sleep he'd turn the television to porn channels. I lost my virginity when I was twelve to this boy from school and he showed me that not everyone will hurt me, and I loved that feeling. I lived through it for years. I dropped out of school when I was thirteen because I was already earning a reputation and a group of boys would beat me up (to the point of broken bones) and sexually assault me a couple of times a week. I kept my mouth shut because these boys' parents were friendly with the principal and nobody would believe what I said anyway. But I got fed up eventually and in September 2008 I walked out of class and never went back. It seems that nobody even noticed me missing from school because nobody ever came to check on me. So, I began walking on a bad path, I met some people, had a lot of stupid sex, formed an addiction to it, and I moved drugs on the side for some income. Most of which I had to pay in rent to my mother in order to stay there instead of living on the street again. I was sixteen I overdosed. I'd had enough and really just reeling from some news I'd got a few months before^3. My mother's oxy^1 use (and perhaps the burns as well) had left me sterile. I had believed that I was going to be a mother one day and prove to myself I could be a better parent to my own children than mine were to me, but this was basically a slap in the face, and is one of the reasons I'd rather die at 35 than 55. There's just not that much use in me being alive any longer than that if there's nobody relying on me. Alas, evidently I didn't die then but I felt absolutely crap just looking at where I was in life so I decided to start a course and finish high school. I finish it completely next month, but I've stopped caring about it any more. It just isn't something that caters to my interests, and I'm not any happier now either. However, just before I started my course I met my ex boyfriend, this was mid 2012. We were in different social classes, but I figured he loved me because we had enough in common. I guessed wrong. We were together for more than a year, not that long for most people, but longer than anything I've managed before that. He was sweet, caring, and his family liked me, and I gave him every part of me that I could. But this wasn't enough and he turned obsessive, paranoid, nasty and abusive. Oh, and he cheated on me with another girl, which he used as a reason to break up with me, though that wasn't the reason I was given; which was that apparently his mother had seen me smoking crack, when I'd never even touched the stuff. But I was okay with that, I knew I was better off without him. This was mid 2013. 2013 was a clusterfuck. My grandmother died, my boyfriend dumped me 3 days after my 18th bithday, my dog died a month later and then, the pièce de résistance, I was raped by the man who lives next door to me. This was October 5th 2013. My finals started a week later and I failed all of them because I wasn't able to study, and I had panic attacks during the exams themselves. It's been a year and I still live next to him, and I can't afford to move. The Police said they can't do anything because I have no proof (besides scars) and the only things that are keeping me sane at this point is my other dog (a Great Dane), my best friend (who is pretty much my new boyfriend), my bong, and a bayonet from the First World War which I keep beside my bed to give me some feeling of security. My house caught fire in April, and a few months later the bolts to my screen door were cut. Twice. My mother laughed at me when I told her that I was raped because she likes the guy, but over the past 12 months we've begun to repair our relationship though I'm still wary of her and mainly use her to help me do my grocery shopping because I can't afford a car and this area has too many hills to be able to carry the bags home. On a side note, my mother told me that my father moved to the US (Arizona) in late 2008 and married a banker before beating her, divorcing her, taking her money and fleeing to Mexico. I haven't heard about him in two years, and I haven't spoken to him since early 2008. I know I need therapy, I know I've got problems. I can't sleep unless I'm stoned because of my PTSD^2 and I'm still dealing with sex addiction, but I've recently kicked my cigarette addiction (of a pack a day for around 4 years, and half packs for 3 years) which I've got going for me. Which is nice. I could really do with some advice on what to do. TL;DR

Source: Reddit, the story of my life is having great ideas, too late. Typically I'll come up with some tech startup idea that I think is non-obvious, with enormous potential, and be busy planning it, thinking it through, starting mockups or coding demos, and getting ready to execute on it... and then I'll see that some company or other has done it, raised millions from VCs, changed the world... I'm always behind the curve. Today the thing I was ready to bet the farm on as soon as my current contract finishes in July, which I really thought would be revolutionary, has been launched by someone else and I'm angry, depressed, distraught and generally fed up. I'd got a good runway of money saved and was going to go full time on it... This story has happened so many times in my life, that it must be a pattern of behaviour that I need to change... I just don't know how. I work crazy hours during the day and there's nothing left out-of-hours to work on side projects... whatever time there is gets sucked up, rightly so, by my family - with young children I don't want to miss growing up. Maybe I just need to crack on with something, anything, once this contract is up - but now what I had planned will look just like a 'me too'. Some of the scale of things that I've been beaten to the punch on (mostly IAAS / PAAS / SAAS projects - I'm a technical architect who's worked for lots of household names) - include Amazon Web Services (I built one of the first IAAS cloud platforms, a few months before AWS was announced, lots of deep stuff with Xen and iSCSI back when their kernel patches wouldn't play nicely together) and Heroku. Then it was Ubuntu's "Juju" software. Today the killer platform automation system I had dreamed of has been revealed by someone else.... But I'm not going to give up... whatever happens, when this contract is up, I'm doing something with the runway money I've saved... whether it's beating the people who've launched today, or something new... I'm going to start . And finish, for once. TL;DR

Here is what the Department of Education Actually Does •The original system of land-grants to create colleges, more or less defunct. •Enforcing Civil Rights Legislation in our public schools •No Child Left Behind and related statistical gathering(some local school district funding is here or scattered to similar programs, but accounts for <=10%). A little more statistical gathering. Administers federal education funding like financial aide. Keep in mind that this funding would still exist without the DOE. What the Department of Education Does NOT Do •Provide funding to school districts(outside of NCLB) •Determine curriculum •Determine/recommend text books •Hire/fire teachers •Make administrative decisions regarding schools. •Provide the majority of funding to schools. Want Proof? Here's what was specified by Congress when creating the Department of Education. No provision of a program administered by the Secretary or by any other officer of the Department shall be construed to authorize the Secretary or any such officer to exercise any direction, supervision, or control over the curriculum, program of instruction, administration, or personnel of any educational institution, school, or school system, over any accrediting agency or association, or over the selection or content of library resources, textbooks, or other instructional materials by any educational institution or school system, except to the extent authorized by law.

I am taking notes on a debate about gun control. Me being a lousy student, wasn't really paying attention. In the void of reason which is my brain, and being a typical little smart ass. I thought it would be funny to quote the song, "Guns don't kill" by Jon Lajoie. You know "Guns don't kill people, uh-uh. I kill people, click click , with guns. pow ." I wrote it with quotes, but didn't write Jon Lajoie's name, obviously being a classic fuck up that I am. Well my teacher did not find it humorous. She sent notified the principals office and gave him my notes. I got called in later and got grilled about whether I've ever thought about shooting up the school. Now the principal knew the song, but he couldn't let something like that slide. Keep in mind, this was soon after Sandy Hook, so everyone was still on edge. I felt like king idiot. TL;DR

After Israel, there are more Jews in the USA than anywhere else on the planet-- between five and eight million, depending on how religion and ethnicity are constructed. The Jewish vote [consistently] ( predicts the presidential election; Jewish groups have considerable clout in lobbying and politics.

The reconciliation of conservatives from the Reformed tradition (Presbyterian and Baptist) with those from the Methodist tradition (Holiness and Pentecostal) was an important step in the growth of the movement. These two groups had been bitter rivals but joined forces against the perceived secularization of American culture. [Link] ( Conversely, US support of Israel can be traced to its inception in 1948. American success and Jewish business are very firmly linked, and as a result America has thoroughly thrown its support behind Israel-- although this has waned in recent years because of Netanyahu's more aggressive settlement policies. Either way, you don't throw a 70 year alliance under the table because some people don't like your policies. What does the US get out of its relationship with Israel? The continued support of one of its most eminent and financially stable minorities, plus the support of other Western nations (namely the UK) who also have sizeable Jewish populations and a special relationship with Israel. So the second half of your question: the US relationship with other states. After 9/11, people constructed the US relationship with Arab states in the Middle East far differently than it actually was. The US and Saudi had an incredibly fruitful relationship for decades, based largely in oil spending. When it was revealed that the 9/11 attackers were largely Saudi, there was, of course, a massive backlash-- but the USA never went to war with Saudi, because the business was too good and the extremism was far too easy to pin on other countries with less authoritarian governments (Afghanistan) or more openly fascist ones (Iraq.) Public disapproval of Muslim countries, paired with the discovery of oil in Canada in massive amounts, meant that the US pulled back from Saudi. What are the other countries in the region to deal with? Well, the USA has attempted to ally itself with the rising stars of the UAE and Qatar, but so far that seems to be a relatively incidental business relationship. Either way, that support will be in business and not in ideology: support for Israel isn't going anywhere. TL;DR

Source: This can be attributed to a few things. Firstly, almost everyone I know that smokes weed plans on doing nothing for a while afterwards, while a lot of people go to a bar planning on driving home. (Yeah, yeah, anecdotal evidence. I know. Please tell me I'm wrong if you think I am.) Secondly, this doesn't take tolerance into consideration. Being someone that has spent a lot of time in and around bars (grew up in one, have worked in one, still am connected with one), I will say that I know a lot of people that can be over the legal limit, and have no effects of drunkenness. If one of these people were sitting at a stop light while sober (even if over the limit) and a car hit them and killed him, it would be contributed to the drunk driver, and included in the stats (though is probably true for marijuana users too). (Yup, a little more anecdotal evidence here.) Thirdly, about 65% attributed to alcohol than marijuana. This doesn't completely make up for the difference between drinking or smoking while driving, but it does cut them drastic numbers in half. It could be that people who smoke daily may only have a small hit many times throughout the day, never getting "high", whereas drinkers don't drink until after work and then have enough to be at or near drunkenness. I'm not trying to stand up for drinking and driving, or trying to make high driving look worse, I just wanted to relate the two. It's illogical to say drinking and driving is worse because it causes more accidents, when in reality more people drink, and drink more often, than people that smoke pot, meaning that the stats aren't swayed quite as much as you think they are. The stats are still swayed though. Don't drink and drive. And, while you're at it, don't drive high. TL;DR

Source: I recently made huge progress with my consistency just by setting up few rules for myself. I started playing ONLY AK-47 and M4A4 on buy rounds. I've never used Aug/SG anyway, but I did sometimes try to AWP, get a scout on a force buy or an autosniper when I had 16k$. On force buys (only once or twice per game) I get Famas/Galil and whenever I can't afford one of those I just get a pistol, never a shotgun, SMG or any scopes rifle. So as I now had an AK/M4 most of the time I sat down, learnt those two spray patterns by heart and told myself to ALWAYS spray with the exception places of Long A on D2 or Yard on Nuke. I used to think I was decent at tapping, but in reality half of my games I was doing fine but the other half I was sitting on three frags blaming my mouse, warm up, practice and whatever what lead me to wasting hours on headshot only servers trying to become ScreaM who I clearly wasn't. Being able to control your spray (more or less) until the last bullet may not make you any quicker, but it gurantees you the kill at some point. And on MG rank where I'm currently playing, it's not about how fast you flick but if you manage to get a total of 100 damage before reloading. Being able to consistently secure all "easy kill" like people showing you your back and even being able to spray down two or three at once consostently is already pretty good. Aside from that knowing I can kill everyone at some point (unlike before where i tapped 10 shots doing 0dmg, sprayed another 10 bullets above his head and then switched in panic to my pistol just to reset the recoil while i still had 10 bullets left in my assault rifle) is also a huge confidence boost. I actually stopped playing DM and doing any sort of warm up altogether yet still am far more consistent than before. Only thing I do is practice my sprays during the 3 mins warmup peroid before any comp match. :) TL;DR

I’ve had a few jobs in the time that we’ve been together where I’ve been home every night, so we’ve experienced all sorts of time apart and together. We’ve been together for 4 years now, living together for 2 and a half, and we’ve had a pretty intense, loving relationship for the most part. Recently it’s beginning to boil over seemingly constantly when I’m at home. When I’m away everything settles down and we go back to professing our yearning for the other and that’s how the cycle has been going for the last 6 or so months. About a year ago we made the mutual decision to up sticks and move to my country of origin, a few hundred miles from her immediate family (she has lots of relatives in the area we moved to,) after living close to her family for a little over a year. Her new job wasn’t everything she hoped it would be and has only seems to have gotten worse since she started. Unfortunately her job is very specific and there is little demand for it where we are at the minute and she’s unwilling to take a step down the ladder for better working conditions. I have always offered my support and that if we need to move for her to work then we can but she seems unwilling to do that as well. When I’m at home I do everything I can to help out, I do all the cooking, all the cleaning, washing etc. as well as taking her away on spa weekends and impromptu romantic holidays to make the most of our time together. This doesn't prevent us from arguing to the point of not talking to one another for hours, even days, upon end. I still love her and she loves me, yet I also find myself seeing the ugly side of her the more and more when we spend time together and I’m sure she feels the same. I have battled with depression throughout my life which she pretty much single handedly got me through so she really does mean the world to me. As I said previously, we used to have a very loving relationship and with it an extremely active sex life although things have slowed down dramatically since then. I’m not a shallow person that needs sex although I find it pretty disheartening going from having sex daily to having sex maybe once a fortnight (bearing in mind I work away for a month at a time) when she insists she still enjoys it. Previously, when I came home from a trip away we couldn’t keep our hands off of one another We’ve talked about marriage & children and both agree that we should hold off for a few years, get into a more stable position financially before doing that We’ve talked at length about what could be causing all of this and it’s been redundant so far. I feel like she may holding me to blame for her situation at work, which she insists she isn’t. We’ve talked about me getting a job where I wouldn’t need to work away so often and I’m currently doing a degree via distance learning with aim to getting a similar salary without the need to travel. I also recently wrote a letter to her and asked her to do the same but she insists she too busy with work. I’m afraid to retort with the obvious (what’s more important?) in case it causes the next big argument. I’m tired of the arguments. I’ve written this much and just realised that I don’t really have a question, just looking to vent. I just find myself thinking that we would both be better off cutting ties and getting on with our separate lives although in my heart of hearts I know I still want this woman. Anyway, any advice from anyone else who has dealt with maintaining a relationship while working away would be greatly received. TL;DR

Source: I guess this is a personal issue, a pattern I've noticed before. I'm interested in a guy, I think he's attractive/cute, and I want to talk to him, we talk, I meet him, blah blah, and the minute he starts showing interest, I stop feeling interested, just a bad habit. I also push guys away, the minute they start getting closer, that's when it's over. I see it, as "Hey, yes, I want your attention. I would love to have it, and I would love to know you want to get to know me, bc I'm interested in getting to know you. But don't show interest, because it will scare the shit out of me." It's actually pretty weird, because I crave that attention from guys I like, and when I receive it, I'll be like "fuck off, I don't want this". Do you also do that? If you have done it before, and you no longer do it, what did you do to avoid fucking shit up? TL;DR

Source: My boyfriend (M22) and I (F24) are a weird situation where because we were good friends while single, we ended up being roommates in a 4-bedroom house. Two months after moving in, we were dating. We've been dating for about 4 months now. So far, this has actually been great and we haven't had much for problems except: Even before we started dating, he always invited me to any event with "the guys". I've been friends with all of his friends for a while and I like hanging out with everyone. Recently though, I've found that once-a-week, he wants to hang out and get drunk with all of them... without me. I get that people need space sometimes and want to hang out on their own, but I really considered these people OUR friends. It makes me jealous to know that he's out having a great time while I'm at home, uninvited to join. I would invite him to any type of group situation and it hurts me that he wouldn't do the same. Is it reasonable for me to feel jealous and a little unwanted, or does he need extra space because we live together and see each other so often? (In the times I've tried talking to him about it, he says he just wants "a night out with the guys". When he comes home, though, I usually hear that he was at a party with 10+ people [guys+girls], or that everyone else's girlfriends showed up, etc.) TL;DR

Source: So I was wandering around my local book store the other day, looking for a copy of the Portable Atheist in the religion section. Naturally, there were bibles galore. I was tempted to pick one up, because I'm legitimately interested in reading it to acquaint myself better with it. The question I immediately asked myself 'well, which one is the right one?' When people assert religious dogma as fact, which bible are they asserting is the correct bible? Or does it depend on the person? And if the word of god is truth, then why are there so many different versions of the bible? If truth is truth, it surely shouldn't need a different interpretation. Otherwise it's just opinion. TL;DR

Source: If you really don’t care that much about decade-old problems, you should start reading this at the fourth paragraph . The first thing that needs to be taken into account is that this is not a problem limited to 1998-2002. Origins could be traced back all to way back to WWII, but leaving excruciating details aside, the fact is that Argentinean economics after WWII were heavily conditioned by inflation. From 1945 onwards, inflation would reach peaks of up to 113% annually, with an average of 25% from 1945-71, and up to 60% the following years. This situation was of course worsened by the military dictatorships’ policies, in addition to the economic crisis of 1980, as well as the Falklands war. The last dictatorship fell in 1983 due to (you guessed it!) economic hardship and the first democratic president, Raúl Alfonsín, was elected. He implemented a plan to change the currency by removing zeros and changing its name to the “Austral”, in addition to other structural reforms. To get an idea of the currency’s constant loss of value: by 1945, 4 Argentinean pesos could be exchanged for 1 USD, then by 1985, 1 new Austral was worth 1 billion pesos (1 USD ≈ 1 Austral = 1,000,000,000 m$n). This “Austral” plan of course failed miserably, since it did nothing to really change the underlying problem of inflation. The Austral started off almost at parity with the US dollar in 1985, but by 1990 you would need 10,000 Australes to buy one dollar, and the percentage of inflation was measured in the thousands. Unsurprisingly, Alfonsín was promptly sacked. After that, Carlos Menem is elected president and this is when things begin to take shape to create the scenario for the crisis. Menem was a diehard neoliberal heavily influenced by the principles of the Washington consensus. One of the most notable acts of the Menem administration was the privatization of many state owned companies such as Entel or Aerolineas Argentinas, and subsequently companies linked to TV, railways, oil and gas. Also, he dismantled many regulations on the economy such as quotas, duty taxes, restrictions on imports and controlled prices. Lastly, in an attempt to stop hyperinflation, he implemented something that translated roughly to “Convertibility Law”. This law would strictly tie the national currency to the US dollar, and subsequently created a new currency (once again…) called the “Peso convertible”. From this point on, the exchange rate could not fluctuate; it was a fixed 1 dollar for 1 peso. This obviously meant that the central bank had to guarantee with its own reserves that each peso could be exchanged for a dollar or for its value in gold. This would later turn out to be too heavy of a burden for the government to bear, but for the first years it did drastically stop inflation. Also, Argentina’s GDP began to grow steadily for the first half of the 90’s, although growth was not homogenously distributed among different economic sectors. Some sectors were heavily damaged and unemployment began to be more and more a growing concern. At the end, the legacy of the Menem administration was a huge government budget deficit of 7 billion pesos, an equally huge foreign debt of 145 billion and a burden on the central bank to maintain the Convertibility Law. So after Menem failed to change the constitution in order to be elected for the 3rd consecutive time, Fernando de la Rúa was elected as the new president in 1999… and this is when shit really starts to go down. The foreign debt was proving to be too big of a burden and it was adding to the already huge government budget deficit. Many big banks were heavily invested in the national government, so there was an increasing fear that the government could default. This fear was exponentially bigger within the general population whose savings were in those banks whose solvency depended on the government being able to pay its debts. So after a failed attempt to calm the market down by injecting 40 billion dollars and by postponing payments farther in the future, the public finally panicked . People started to massively withdraw their money from banks, 5 billion US dollars worth of deposits were lost from January to March 2001. The government then tried to negotiate a package of 29.5 billion dollars with the IMF and some private banks in an attempt to reduce the burden of the foreign debt. However, as it is tradition with the IMF, they only agreed to the package if the Argentinean government implemented unpopular measures that were basically a big fuck-you to its citizens. At the end this served for close to nothing and capital outflow and recession continued at a staggering pace. At this point, the government imposed heavy restrictions which would later be called “El Corralito” or little “corral”. For those of you who don’t know what a corral is, it’s [this]( An enclosed space in which livestock is kept, a very appropriate term . The Corralito consisted on restrictions, both on financial entities and common people, as a last resort to stop deposit outflow and to discourage speculation that the “Convertibility Law” would be dismantled. These restrictions were very harsh; people could only get access to $250 a week, even if you had tens of thousands in your account and had many expenses. So of course this sudden restriction of liquidity halted all economic activity: it paralyzed commerce, froze credit, people and companies could not make payments to other people or companies who subsequently also couldn’t make payments. Ultimately, this created such civil unrest that de la Rúa was deposed. Then Rodriguez Saá assumed the presidency for two weeks, in which he declared that the government would default, the biggest default in history. However, he refused to leave the Convertibility Law, reason for which he was deposed. Eduardo Duhalde then took office, and the first thing he did was to dismantle the Convertibility Law and to turn all credit to Pesos. With the Convertibility Law, the peso was fixed at one dollar, so even if you could only access $250 a week, theoretically the money you had in the bank would not lose its value. However, after the Law was waived, a new exchange rate was established: 1 USD = 1.40 Pesos. This literary meant that people lost tons of money overnight. However, debt owed to the financial system would still be paid at 1 USD = 1 Peso, this was called “asymmetric pesification”. And then finally, after the damage was done, the end of “The Corralito” was announced in December 2002. The Supreme Court backed the government’s “pesification” at $1.40 for every dollar, plus inflation, and a 4% annual interest rate. At the end, after the deposits were freed, the final result was around 3 pesos for every dollar. So yeah… many people got fucked over. I understand that I left out many things, like the IMF constant meddling, cold war relations, the Mexican crisis of 1994, military dictatorships, etc. But this turned out pretty long as it is; it’s very hard to properly explain this without writing an actual paper on it. So please cut me some slack. TL;DR

Source: Just very pleased with myself (big ego incoming), that's all. I got to the finish line at 7:19 and the woman there (who I assume was in charge of the event) said she was very worried about letting me participate because of my age, but she was glad to see I'd finished! Here is the [elevation map]( Like u/Georgebob suggested, I ended up walking all of the uphills except the first (which I sorely regretted later). The race started at 6am, when it was cloudy & sprinkling, about 50 degrees. If nobody has seen 120 headlamps bobbing up and down across switchbacks, I highly recommend going out and watching a similar event sometime in your life - it's an incredibly cool sight to see. [Here's]( a poor photograph of the start, but you get the idea. Everyone was very supportive and friendly on this race. In the first 30-45 minutes of the race both of my feet went numb - the left foot was worse than the right. This happens to me every time I run/walk up hills - I've read that it could be compartment syndrome(?). In any case, it stopped after a while, per usual, and I continued. By the first aid station (6.5 miles) it was starting to get lighter, and I began to run with a very friendly woman who helped me pace myself over the next 6 miles. At the 2nd aid station (11.5 miles - apparently the previous year they served beer at this station) we were 3,000 feet higher than the start, and it was absolutely frigid & densely packed with fog. My hands & arms were bright red because I had left my arm-warmers at the car. At the 3rd aid station (18 miles) I was greeted by my [Mom, Dad, Brother and Dog]( It was just starting to get warm. [4th aid station (22 miles)]( - I had an intense pain in my right knee from running downhill so much, and my left calf had just spasmed for the first time. This was the place where I had to decide whether to drop out or not - I was absolutely exhausted, but figured I'd probably not forgive myself if I didn't try to finish. After the 5th aid station at 24 miles my right knee really started to hurt. It was a very steep downhill for the next 3.5 miles, and I had to walk the majority of it. The rest of the race was a blur of pain & muscle spasms. I tried to run the flats, but ended up walking a ton. [WHO CARES, I FINISHED A 50K!!!]( TL;DR

After he left military service, my grandparents received a call from his former company commander in Hawaii saying that if he didnt leave the state soon, he'd end up dead. my family sent him money for a plane ticket, but he never came. Then they sent him the ticket itself, and he showed up at the airport with only a carry-on. He left behind a nice condo and a brand new jeep. Then, he would disappear for days on end, and no one would know if he was dead or alive. He once apparently traded my grandparents' car in exchange for drugs, and said it was stolen. It was later recovered with blood and bullet holes in the back seat. He lost a couple cars that way, actually, but the other one was never found. Thankfully, after my grandparents died, he came out of the closet and is now in a functional relationship with his partner. He also just graduated beautician school (is that what you call it?) with one of the two highest scores ever recorded in the state.

For example maybe a more skilled pilot can soft counter a tanker, but it takes a lot longer to kill him than if you engaged it using something with more firepower, so the tanker has more time for someone to assist him, but a ground option would be faster to kill the tank with. If a more skilled tank could land his shot on a less skilled pilot it would be a quick kill, but it couldn't happen realistically until the esf engages the tank or at least gets close, meaning the tank wouldn't be as useful for AA as an esf still for backing up a liberator.

Source: I returned to the game recently. I got married shortly after the game released which involved a relocation so I was off the game for a while then I wasn't hearing very good stuff when I was ready to return and was having to decide which expenses to cut and so Wildstar just got the axe. I was playing SWTOR in the interim, but honestly, after leveling that game just leaves me somewhat bored so I checked to see if I could do some kind of trial to check out WS again and got the 10 day to try out. I was out of 'WS shape' and my smallish guild had disbanded so I didn't really bother but kept keeping up with the game more. When the Mystery Box Promo hit I bought a couple of boxes on clearance at my localish Wal-Mart and went for it and now I'm glad I did. I forgot just how fun it was playing this game and how unique the housing system is (sooooooo much better than SWTOR's rigid grid based housing). So, now I'm a full on subscriber again. I can't say what's brought other's back than to speculate hearing good things from the community and seeing that people are still here. TL;DR

Source: The Elder Scrolls games are all single player RPGs centred around the player character... They're very much about you exploring the world on your own and discovering things while being immersed in said world, feeling like you are the first player to have done so... Not to mention your growth into being the most powerful individual around capable of fucking up everyone else's shit. That does not translate at all into an MMO by virtue of the fact that now you've got thousands of player characters running around. The exploration aspect is watered down because you're not the only player character in the world to discover it, and then everyone else is equally growing in power, so you no longer have that aspect of uniquely being this powerful motherfucker unmatched by anyone else.

I (a featherweight male) was training with a newbie yesterday who had 30 lbs on me, and he was blown away, claiming "You're so strong!". I was going ~10%, simply feeding him the responses so he and I could work on what we learned in class. With your attitude, I would've smashed the shit out of him, and he wouldn't have learned a thing. Instead, he got to work the two things he knew, and I got to work my escapes. TL;DR

Source: Hi /r/christianity, In the thread about if Christianity would one day end, I posited that an increasingly liberal society has a diluting effect on Christianity that I think will one day lead to the religion's disappearance. /u/EvanYork asked me to defend the notion that a liberal version of a religion is "watered down," and I thought it would be fun to make a new thread for everyone to discuss. It's entirely possible that me and EvanYork could be splitting hairs, but to be clear when I say "watered down" in that context, I don't mean it in a negative or pejorative sense. I simply mean, less distinct and recognizable than it used to be. I haven't pondered the effects of liberalism on religion in general as EvanYork asked me, but for Christianity I'm fairly confident that as society becomes more liberal, as it will and always has over time, Christianity will become more and more diluted. So what do I have to back this up? Well, two main points. The first is somewhat anecdotal: I see very little to no difference between myself and Christians in my daily life. I have plenty of Christian friends/acquaintances, and honestly they're no different than me in practically all respects. Most of them get up much earlier than me on Sunday mornings and go to church, but that's about it. Most of them are friendly, have no problem with cursing, drinking, smoking tobacco/weed, support gay marriage, and rarely talk about spiritual stuff. Just like me. If you had some random person watch me and 10 of my Christian friends lead their daily lives, it would be very, very difficult for them to pick out the atheist. I'm not saying this is a bad thing at all! I enjoy most of these people's company. But aren't y'all supposed to be "salt and light" unto the world or something like that? Most of the Christians I know (a lot), are really no different than anyone else. It seems to me that as time goes on, Christians themselves become more "diluted" into the world, simply meaning less recognizable. My other point is pointing to Christianity's evolution, particularly in America, as a major religion. Case and point: Spong. Only a few hundred years ago, this guy would have been BURNED ALIVE on a stake for his theological views. Today, a lot of Christians, probably most, don't entirely agree with him, but they tolerate his views, and there's plenty of Christians that DO see his views as legitimate. So once again we see as time goes on, things get more accepting/liberal/progressive, and Christianity is no exception. As time goes on, there will almost inevitably be more Spong's, and eventually his flavor of theology could/probably will be the norm. Then I ask you, what's NEXT? What comes after Spong as society becomes more liberal in the future? In my humble opinion, Spong is already almost completely unrecognizable enough from mainstream Christianity already. This is precisely why I keep using the word "diluted," because I think it is absolutely perfect for this context. In my view, this whole phenomena is just like salt being diluted in water. If Christianity is the salt, and liberalism is the water, as more water is added over time, eventually it gets to the point where you don't even realize there was ever any salt at all. I hope I laid out my thoughts clearly. And I do realize that many of you see it as an absolute impossibility for Christianity to ever die out, because you believe Jesus would come back and Revelations and all that would happen first. So I don't want to talk so much about the end of Christianity, so much as the diluting effect I see liberalism having on Christianity. What do you think? Do you agree with my ideas of what effects an ever increasingly liberal society has on Christianity? Do you think Christianity is becoming less recognizable and distinct from "the world" as time goes on? TL;DR
Target: I think that the current state of Christianity is a very good thing. I think it's a good thing that the world is more tolerant and more accepting of people of all faiths, and that the world is more tolerant and more accepting of people of all religions. I think that the world is more tolerant and more accepting of people of all religions, and that the world is more tolerant and more accepting of people of all religions.

Waiting for that BG queue? Kill maim burn dig mine farm force your pets into brutal gladitorial combat. If you are waiting for a queue pop a potion of luck, (you can get golden lotus from the tillers) and go murderface on the vale. Kill all the mogu. You net 1k gold per hour + skyshard so you can ride Alani or sell it. Finally - regarding being a hunter - look at icy veins to make sure you are pushing the right buttons, ask mr robot will tell you if you are gemmed reforged and enchanted right, and finally look at the players around you. My priest is 568, as a disc priest it's not uncommon for me to top meters in 5 man. Does it mean the dps is shit? No. It means I have over ONE HUNDRED ITEM LEVELS ON THE INSTANCE.
