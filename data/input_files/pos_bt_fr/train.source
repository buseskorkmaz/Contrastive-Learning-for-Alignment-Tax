We're enabling developers to build awesome applications with bank and bill provider(Cell phone bills, utility bills, etc) data.

If working on hard problems (data extraction is the name of our game) and working with big data (we currently only have hundreds of thousands of rows, but its quite clear it will grow to billions of rows at the least very quickly) are on your to-do list we'd love to chat. Right now we're looking for Senior engineers and we're not particularly worried about your language of choice, since we're helping devs build integrations in many different languages having our core team be a well rounded bunch of polyglots is important. Some things you'll be doing on a daily basis. * Answering support emails and chats - Our customers are engineers and with our engineers answering their questions we can build a much better relationship with them over time as well as drastically improve the product * Working in our customers codebases to help them integrate Spout quickly and painlessly * Hacking on our core API and finding more efficient ways to extract data from the providers we support and the new ones we're adding for our customers * Pushing changes to our API dashboard or sandbox that we're currently building to help give devs more insight into their products so we can help them grow their business. * Hacking things for productivity around the office, whether its a new webhook integration from github to hipchat, or just something to make us smile when a new customer signs up we believe in working on projects that are fun quick hacks and keep up office Morale as well as make us better at making our customers happy. In an ideal world you will also be: * Outgoing - We really need our first core engineers to serve as Customer Support, Developer Evangelist and Full-Stack engineers. We know its asking alot, but if wearing many hats is your idea of a good time, we want to chat - you won't ever lack a sense of responsibility around here! * Willing to put together teams for hackathons - We'd love it if we could all hack together on the weekends and build cool things with our API or help other devs do it at things like startup weekend etc. * Be active in the open source community - We think its important to give back to the community, great open source devs have taught us all so much about programming, at Spout we want to contribute back to that community and help nurture the new developers who will eventually be building awesome things on our API. * Willing to speak at conferences - We want our engineers to make names for themselves and we want to hire the best. We'd love it if you were an authority in your area of expertise or at least wanted to stay on the edge of what you were doing, we're big believers in telling everyone about what we're doing and having them learn from us as we learn from them too. In addition to these things we're offering meaningful equity and salary and we are working to build a culture of builders who love what they're doing. Working together as a team is important to us and if you are the type of dev who is regularly looking for the next best thing it may not be a good fit, we want people who want to work with us and we'll err more to the side of eagerness to learn than expertise that is just looking for a higher salary every chance they get. That said, we're paying well and you shouldn't be taking a pay cut to come here, we generate real revenue already and we're just getting started.
