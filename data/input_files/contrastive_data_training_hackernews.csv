"khan academy — mountain view, ca (we also love interns, and remote is a possibility)
we're a small, non-profit tech startup bringing a free, world-class education to anyone, anywhere.
here's a testimonial we received last week:
==================================
i am 52. i returned to school almost twenty years ago and did quite well--but i had taken care of all my math requirements 15 years before that and my degree is about as far from math as one can get. so i had not seen the inside of a math classroom for more than thirty years when i decided not long ago that i wanted to review high school math. listening to sal's explanations have made this so easy it is as though i had remembered all of it this whole time!
i am disabled now, and have no means to continue formal studies in much of anything, but i am now learning the calculus and linear algebra i was planning on studying when i was much younger--before my college career ran off the rails for an extended time. thank you sal (and the internets) for letting me remain a student! keep this place running; i want to be able to hang around here until i am no longer able to hang around anywhere anymore.
==================================
every month we get hundreds of letters like this from people in all walks of life who are thankful for our free, high-quality educational content. most of you reading this are familiar with sal's videos, but we also have hundreds of videos by other teachers, partnerships with organizations like moma and the california academy of sciences, and a huge library of interactive exercises. over 20 million math problems are done every week on our site.
a few things we're currently working on building right now:
– the next version of our personalized learning dashboard [1] to make the ui more consistent across subjects and to help people learn better
– improved knowledge models so we can better know what you know and don't know [2]
– infrastructure improvements to make the site more reliable and faster for our millions of visitors every month [3]
– better tools for our content creators to allow them to make thousands of engaging, interactive exercise problems without knowing how to code [4]
– a major revision to our ios app to let students practice skills on the go (or in a classroom with ipads!)
you'll be part of a small team working alongside both ""celebrity"" devs (like jquery creator john resig and google's first employee craig silverstein) and many more who you haven't heard of but who are also really awesome.
==================================
we're especially looking for new product designers and mobile devs but we have a handful of other positions open -- take a look and see if anything suits you.

"khan academy — mountain view, ca (we also love interns, and remote is a possibility)
we're a small, non-profit tech startup bringing a free, world-class education to anyone, anywhere.
here's a testimonial we received last week:
==================================
i am 52. i returned to school almost twenty years ago and did quite well--but i had taken care of all my math requirements 15 years before that and my degree is about as far from math as one can get. so i had not seen the inside of a math classroom for more than thirty years when i decided not long ago that i wanted to review high school math. listening to sal's explanations have made this so easy it is as though i had remembered all of it this whole time!
i am disabled now, and have no means to continue formal studies in much of anything, but i am now learning the calculus and linear algebra i was planning on studying when i was much younger--before my college career ran off the rails for an extended time. thank you sal (and the internets) for letting me remain a student! keep this place running; i want to be able to hang around here until i am no longer able to hang around anywhere anymore.
==================================
every month we get hundreds of letters like this from people in all walks of life who are thankful for our free, high-quality educational content. most of you reading this are familiar with sal's videos, but we also have hundreds of videos by other teachers, partnerships with organizations like moma and the california academy of sciences, and a huge library of interactive exercises. over 20 million math problems are done every week on our site.
a few things we're currently working on building right now:
– the next version of our personalized learning dashboard [1] to make the ui more consistent across subjects and to help people learn better
– improved knowledge models so we can better know what you know and don't know [2]
– infrastructure improvements to make the site more reliable and faster for our millions of visitors every month [3]
– better tools for our content creators to allow them to make thousands of engaging, interactive exercise problems without knowing how to code [4]
– a major revision to our ios app to let students practice skills on the go (or in a classroom with ipads!)
you'll be part of a small team working alongside both ""celebrity"" devs (like jquery creator john resig and google's first employee craig silverstein) and many more who you haven't heard of but who are also really awesome.
==================================
we're especially looking for new product designers and mobile devs but we have a handful of other positions open -- take a look and see if anything suits you.

- postgresql, redis

our codebase has something for everyone. 30% plain ruby, 30% javascript, 30% rails and 10% other code. we have good code, bad code, tested code, untested code. we have dsls (for our non-programmers), api, fast ec2 instances for calculations. things we did before: git as a database, custom query language to extract data from the model, massive processing within a rails request (think thousands of ruby objects calculating energy flows). visualizations with raphael.
you are an experienced developer, you think lean and solve problems creatively. you're proactive, fix first, complain later. you live in (ordered by preference): netherlands, europe, world. you'll work the first months onsite, thereafter you may go abroad and work remote (again). current dev team has an international background: italian, british, dutch, swiss, us.

we are a white-label saas that is used by solar and energy efficiency companies to collect their customer's utility bill and usage data automatically. our service enables these companies to provide instant quotes and continuous monitoring of their customers savings, which lowers soft costs and accelerates the sustainable energy industry.
==job description==
you will be in charge of writing tools, scripts, and libraries that translate utility data formats to our api format. often these utility data formats are complex and unique to each utility (pdf bills, xml data, csv data, etc.), so you will need to be very clever in collecting and parsing a huge variety of formats. also, these scripts can break unexpectedly when utilities change their interfaces, so being able to update them quickly is important. we don't get paid by our clients unless our service actually works.
you will be working alongside me, daniel roesler, and my co-founder, elena lucas, in our office at the sfuncube in downtown oakland. our current codebase is written and maintained by me. it's well organized, documented, and tested, and i will continue code along with you.
the sfuncube is a space specifically dedicated to solar software companies, and the community there is fantastic. we have a roof deck, and all the desks are solar panels! our building is right around the corner from the 19th st bart stop, so commuting from pretty much anywhere in the bay area is easy.
==experience required==
no years of experience, education, or certification requirements, but you do need to be able to convince me that you know and have experience with:
* pgp (encryption)
* javascript (not jquery, vanilla javascript)
* python (vanilla python)
* django (web framework)
* celery (task queue)
* redis (caching)
* postgresql (database)
* ubuntu/linux (server os)
* other (side projects, hackathons, hobbies, stuff you do for fun)

depending on experience and ability, our salary range is $80k-$120k with 1-2% stock options (i hate it when job postings don't include salary). if you are located outside of the bay area, we will also pay moving expenses.

we, the si engineers, are on a mission to act as force multipliers for all spotify engineers. we build and maintain software components that allow our feature teams to move fast without breaking things. some examples of what si engineers are currently working on:
- core authentication systems for spotify
- high-performance inter-system messaging software
- core storage technologies (cassandra, postgresql)
- service discovery and orchestration
the nyc-based si team is just booting up and we're still quite small. new team members can expect to have a significant impact on our projects. our mission is to revamp how spotify deploys backend services and while we're currently looking at lxc, nothing is set in stone. as the team grows we'll start to branch off into other areas of the spotify infrastructure universe. lots of fun will be had.
if we are the right team for you, and vice versa, then you're probably a bit like us. here are some of the traits that we share:
- a passion for programming and computing in a large scale distributed environment with millions of users
- significant familiarity with gnu/linux or other unix-like systems
- knowledge of a couple of programming languages, typically including python or java
- an urge to kiss, to iterate, to deliver and to produce high quality software in the process

"software developer, stat.io - cambridge uk, or remote
we aim to allow users to understand the socio-economics of any location, from the population of a country to the crime rate of a postcode. organisations can then use this data to improve their decision-making, whether it's businesses making strategic sales and marketing decisions, ngos trying to understand a country, or somebody else entirely.
the two main technical challenges we face are:
* importing data from many different sources, from apis to excel files, and understanding their structure. for instance, given an excel file, we need to determine the structure of any tables, such as which columns represent a location. we also want to pick up as much metadata as possible, such as a description of the dataset.
* designing a ui that allows users to find what they're looking for, and then making that ui fast (we're currently up to about 10,000,000 datasets and 200,000,000 data points)
our technology stack:
* postgres + postgis to store the data we've imported
* elasticsearch for... search
* python code to import data from the original source to our database (with a tiny bit of redis for some basic queueing)

"spotify's service infrastructure (si) team in new york city is hiring.
we, the si engineers, are on a mission to act as force multipliers for all spotify engineers. we build and maintain software components that allow our feature teams to move fast without breaking things. some examples of what si engineers are currently working on:
- core authentication systems for spotify
- high-performance inter-system messaging software
- core storage technologies (cassandra, postgresql)
- service discovery and orchestration
the nyc-based si team is just booting up and we're still quite small. new team members can expect to have a significant impact on our projects. our mission is to revamp how spotify deploys backend services and while we're currently looking at lxc, nothing is set in stone. as the team grows we'll start to branch off into other areas of the spotify infrastructure universe. lots of fun will be had.
if we are the right team for you, and vice versa, then you're probably a bit like us. here are some of the traits that we share:
- a passion for programming and computing in a large scale distributed environment with millions of users
- significant familiarity with gnu/linux or other unix-like systems
- knowledge of a couple of programming languages, typically including python or java
- an urge to kiss, to iterate, to deliver and to produce high quality software in the process
does this sound like a place for you? if so, please reach out to us. we'd love to get to know you. send us your cv (if you have one), a link to your hobby project or github and perhaps a short message to further explain who you are. mention hn and we'll pay extra attention to your application.

this is a great fit for people who want to work:
... at a product-driven company bringing an old-fashioned industry into the future
... on a product that has a lot of usage and visibility in the startup community
... in a company that strongly values good software development practices
... at a financially sound company
... hard, with ownership and dedication (but sustainably)
... with flexible hours and competitive pay
... where you'll be a key early hire

- an inability to write anything but clean, maintainable code.
- bothered by code without test coverage.
- 5+ years of experience building software as part of a team with strong development practices

it's widely held that science is too slow, and too closed. we are working on changing that, and re-inventing the way that scientists communicate. the stakes are high. if the inefficiencies in science can be removed, we may be able to accelerate science by a factor of 2, leading to a huge impact for humanity.

  * front-end developer with an eye for design (ui/ux/css/jquery)
  * ios developer (you know, ios)
  * full stack software engineer (rails)

over the past few years, rap genius has gone from tiny side-project to one of the biggest music sites on the internet. we’ve raised 15 mil from some pretty dope investors and grown to employ some of the most talented devs this world has ever seen. we’re expanding from explaining rap into all of text, starting with poetry, rock, and news. now were looking for genius full-stack web and ios developers to help build the “internet talmud”, the one platform for explaining the world’s primary source texts.
why would you want to work for us?
  * one of the fastest-growing sites on the internet, seriously this is based on
    actual numbers.
  * tiny, quick-shipping team with a ton of autonomy – so you never think to yourself:
    “what did i accomplish this year/month/30 seconds ago?”
  * a development and design agenda that is led by developers and designers –
    so no marketing or product people telling you how the image carousel should work.
  * gym in building, free food, sweet benefits, whatever computer you want, more
    money than your last job, equity, etc.
  * live in new york, where a new restaurant is born every 1.5 seconds!

a little about the dev team:
  * seven people total: five backend, one front-end/design, and one totally
    sick intern.
  * independently led projects.
  * we iterate quickly and push code to production constantly.
    we're not afraid to put the ""first draft"" of a feature in production
    to see how it behaves in the wild before perfecting it.
  * projects and priorities are determined communally (usually over burritos).
  * ruby on rails via heroku + sass, compass, jquery, git, and more!

more about the positions:
are you a boss front-end developer with an eye for design? hit us up. a bomb ios developer who wants to build the rap genius iphone app from the ground up? an experienced and creative full-stack rails engineer? we’ve been waiting for you. send us your deets.

  * educational background and/or most recent job
  * a little bit about your technical background,
    including something brief about what you like
    and dislike about the technologies you’ve used.
  * if you come in for an interview, you’ll start by making a short
    technical presentation to the team and taking their questions.

we've hired three full-time people and several interns from these ""who is hiring"" threads, including one just last month ... it really works!!
we're looking for people who want to work with:
* ruby on rails (we're the #2 largest rails site, after twitter)
* javascript (we recently switched to coffeescript and are loving it)
* ios
* android
* machine learning / data mining / recommendations
* back-end problems: scalability, web crawling, big data, analytics
* devops and web infrastructure
that said, we care way more about your personality and general hacking skills then what languages you've used so far, so if you haven't used these but want to break into mobile or web development, this could be a good opportunity for you. we've hired people from these threads with everywhere from 0 to 10 years of experience.
we're profitable, very well funded and have a really fun office environment (go-karts + a zipline!). we've got flexible hours, a very engineer-driven company culture, and a really terrific team.
scribd alumni have gone on to found 4 other ycombinator companies, more than from any other startup. we think this says something about the kind of people that we like to hire.
we're working on a giant new product launch now that we're really excited about. if you're interested in ebooks, i'd love to tell you about it.
generally we're looking for full-time and intern hires (junior year or older) who want to move to sf. h1b and relocation are no problem.

"santa monica, ca - full-time(remote possible for right candidate)
at spout (<a href=""http://spout.co"" >) we're building twilio for finance. we've only been at it a few months and we've already added over 700 banks and bill providers to the platform.
we're enabling developers to build awesome applications with bank and bill provider(cell phone bills, utility bills, etc) data.
we're still a small team (2 growing to four in the next two weeks), but we're looking for a few more early hires.
if working on hard problems (data extraction is the name of our game) and working with big data (we currently only have hundreds of thousands of rows, but its quite clear it will grow to billions of rows at the least very quickly) are on your to-do list we'd love to chat.
right now we're looking for senior engineers and we're not particularly worried about your language of choice, since we're helping devs build integrations in many different languages having our core team be a well rounded bunch of polyglots is important.
some things you'll be doing on a daily basis.
* answering support emails and chats - our customers are engineers and with our engineers answering their questions we can build a much better relationship with them over time as well as drastically improve the product
* working in our customers codebases to help them integrate spout quickly and painlessly
* hacking on our core api and finding more efficient ways to extract data from the providers we support and the new ones we're adding for our customers
* pushing changes to our api dashboard or sandbox that we're currently building to help give devs more insight into their products so we can help them grow their business.
* hacking things for productivity around the office, whether its a new webhook integration from github to hipchat, or just something to make us smile when a new customer signs up we believe in working on projects that are fun quick hacks and keep up office morale as well as make us better at making our customers happy.
in an ideal world you will also be:
* outgoing - we really need our first core engineers to serve as customer support, developer evangelist and full-stack engineers. we know its asking alot, but if wearing many hats is your idea of a good time, we want to chat - you won't ever lack a sense of responsibility around here!
* willing to put together teams for hackathons - we'd love it if we could all hack together on the weekends and build cool things with our api or help other devs do it at things like startup weekend etc.
* be active in the open source community - we think its important to give back to the community, great open source devs have taught us all so much about programming, at spout we want to contribute back to that community and help nurture the new developers who will eventually be building awesome things on our api.
* willing to speak at conferences - we want our engineers to make names for themselves and we want to hire the best. we'd love it if you were an authority in your area of expertise or at least wanted to stay on the edge of what you were doing, we're big believers in telling everyone about what we're doing and having them learn from us as we learn from them too.
in addition to these things we're offering meaningful equity and salary and we are working to build a culture of builders who love what they're doing.
working together as a team is important to us and if you are the type of dev who is regularly looking for the next best thing it may not be a good fit, we want people who want to work with us and we'll err more to the side of eagerness to learn than expertise that is just looking for a higher salary every chance they get.
that said, we're paying well and you shouldn't be taking a pay cut to come here, we generate real revenue already and we're just getting started.
come be a part of something big, we can't wait to talk to you.

At Spout (http://spout.co >) we're building Twilio for finance. We've only been at it a few months and we've already added over 700 banks and bill providers to the platform.
We're enabling developers to build awesome applications with bank and bill provider(Cell phone bills, utility bills, etc) data.
We're still a small team (2 growing to four in the next two weeks), but we're looking for a few more early hires.
If working on hard problems (data extraction is the name of our game) and working with big data (we currently only have hundreds of thousands of rows, but its quite clear it will grow to billions of rows at the least very quickly) are on your to-do list we'd love to chat.
Right now we're looking for Senior engineers and we're not particularly worried about your language of choice, since we're helping devs build integrations in many different languages having our core team be a well rounded bunch of polyglots is important.
Some things you'll be doing on a daily basis.
* Answering support emails and chats - Our customers are engineers and with our engineers answering their questions we can build a much better relationship with them over time as well as drastically improve the product
* Working in our customers codebases to help them integrate Spout quickly and painlessly
* Hacking on our core API and finding more efficient ways to extract data from the providers we support and the new ones we're adding for our customers
* Pushing changes to our API dashboard or sandbox that we're currently building to help give devs more insight into their products so we can help them grow their business.
* Hacking things for productivity around the office, whether its a new webhook integration from github to hipchat, or just something to make us smile when a new customer signs up we believe in working on projects that are fun quick hacks and keep up office Morale as well as make us better at making our customers happy.
In an ideal world you will also be:
* Outgoing - We really need our first core engineers to serve as Customer Support, Developer Evangelist and Full-Stack engineers. We know its asking alot, but if wearing many hats is your idea of a good time, we want to chat - you won't ever lack a sense of responsibility around here!
* Willing to put together teams for hackathons - We'd love it if we could all hack together on the weekends and build cool things with our API or help other devs do it at things like startup weekend etc.
* Be active in the open source community - We think its important to give back to the community, great open source devs have taught us all so much about programming, at Spout we want to contribute back to that community and help nurture the new developers who will eventually be building awesome things on our API.
* Willing to speak at conferences - We want our engineers to make names for themselves and we want to hire the best. We'd love it if you were an authority in your area of expertise or at least wanted to stay on the edge of what you were doing, we're big believers in telling everyone about what we're doing and having them learn from us as we learn from them too.
In addition to these things we're offering meaningful equity and salary and we are working to build a culture of builders who love what they're doing.
Working together as a team is important to us and if you are the type of dev who is regularly looking for the next best thing it may not be a good fit, we want people who want to work with us and we'll err more to the side of eagerness to learn than expertise that is just looking for a higher salary every chance they get.
That said, we're paying well and you shouldn't be taking a pay cut to come here, we generate real revenue already and we're just getting started.
Come be a part of something big, we can't wait to talk to you.

location: new york, ny
postion: full-time on-site software engineer
theladders' mission is to match people with the jobs that are right for them. in order to do that we need a strong engineering team.
currently we are looking for a software engineer to join our platform engineering team. this team is responsible for developing and maintaining the software and systems that power our websites, mobile applications, and marketing.
a few things about us:
* we try to use the right tool for the right job; maybe a shell script, maybe multiple storm topologies communicating via rabbitmq and reading data from internal web services. and while we have found some tools that work, we're always willing to incorporate new ones if they give us a new way of tackling a problem.
* we know that engineering is all about understanding tradeoffs, not applying the same solution over and over again to every problem.
* sometimes we get to work with fun new tools (scala, clojure, storm, elastic search), sometimes we work with old standards (java, python, bash). sometimes we write cool new code, sometimes we are on call dealing with a production issue.
* we think pushing code into production is only the beginning of our job. we are responsible for what we put out in the world, including monitoring and maintainence.
a few things about you:
* you're an engineer, but you know how to think like an operations person.
* you cut your teeth in open source software, and know how to find documents, read the source, ask for help, and report a bug.
* you're excited about glamorous work, but you're willing to sometimes do shit work, because in the end somebody has do it.
if this sounds interesting and you think you'd be a good match, or if you're interested in learning the skills to become a good match, please get in touch with andrew turley (redacted_email).","company: theladders (http://theladders.com >)

the way legal transactions are done is filled with inefficiencies, which leads to ridiculously high legal fees. we're fixing this by building software that automates and streamlines the process.
we're profitable and growing. we launched a company formation service last year, and are now one of the most popular ways for high-growth technology startups to incorporate. y combinator and 500 startups both use our software to handle their investment paperwork.
if you are interested in fixing the legal industry, this is arguably the best place to be (no hyperbole).
we use a lot of ruby on rails and javascript, so familiarity with these technologies is a requirement. that said, we're not religious about any particular technology - we believe in using the right tool for a given problem (we also have services written in scala and go). we have extensive spec and feature coverage, and have everything hooked up to a continuous integration server.
this is a great fit for people who want to work:
... at a product-driven company bringing an old-fashioned industry into the future
... on a product that has a lot of usage and visibility in the startup community
... in a company that strongly values good software development practices
... at a financially sound company
... hard, with ownership and dedication (but sustainably)
... with flexible hours and competitive pay
... where you'll be a key early hire
some hard requirements we have:
- an inability to write anything but clean, maintainable code.
- bothered by code without test coverage.
- 5+ years of experience building software as part of a team with strong development practices
- 5+ years of experience with rails and javascript

the list of important and interesting projects we want to tackle is ever-increasing. because the range of projects is diverse, we need a full-stack rails engineer with experience working on a wide variety of projects.
you’ll work on projects like: improving our natural language date range search, implementing integrations with 3rd party services, or working to improve the responsiveness and reliability of our api. you’ll also work with the entire team in creating new customer-facing features, from idea, through prototype, to release and maintenance.
* our backend runs on rails with mysql, redis, and elasticsearch on aws. you should have experience building scalable and maintainable services with rails.
* our front-end is built with coffeescript, sass and haml. you should have a deep understanding of html, css and javascript.
* the glue between our front-end and back-end is http, so you should have a thorough understanding of this part of the stack including: cookies, caching, ajax, cross-domain sharing, security issues, etc.
* we write automated tests for all of our code. you should be passionate about testing since you know it’s the only way to deliver high quality software.
we are looking for someone who can spend about 10 hours per week contracting with us, so we can both get a sense of what it’s like working together. we’d love for you to be in the pacific timezone, but we’re open to the right person, anywhere.
while this is a contracting opportunity to start, we are always looking for the right person to join the team full-time. we believe working together on a contract basis initially is critically important before bringing someone on as a full-time member of the team.
if you’re interested, please send a link to your github account and any projects you’ve worked on recently that you are particularly proud of. we prefer great work over resumes.

While this is a contracting opportunity to start, we are always looking for the right person to join the team full-time. We believe working together on a contract basis initially is critically important before bringing someone on as a full-time member of the team.
If you’re interested, please send a link to your Github account and any projects you’ve worked on recently that you are particularly proud of. We prefer great work over resumes.

the list of important and interesting projects we want to tackle is ever-increasing. because the range of projects is diverse, we need a full-stack rails engineer with experience working on a wide variety of projects.
you’ll work on projects like: improving our natural language date range search, implementing integrations with 3rd party services, or working to improve the responsiveness and reliability of our api. you’ll also work with the entire team in creating new customer-facing features, from idea, through prototype, to release and maintenance.
* our backend runs on rails with mysql, redis, and elasticsearch on aws. you should have experience building scalable and maintainable services with rails.
* our front-end is built with coffeescript, sass and haml. you should have a deep understanding of html, css and javascript.
* the glue between our front-end and back-end is http, so you should have a thorough understanding of this part of the stack including: cookies, caching, ajax, cross-domain sharing, security issues, etc.
* we write automated tests for all of our code. you should be passionate about testing since you know it’s the only way to deliver high quality software.
we are looking for someone who can spend about 10 hours per week contracting with us, so we can both get a sense of what it’s like working together. we’d love for you to be in the pacific timezone, but we’re open to the right person, anywhere.
while this is a contracting opportunity to start, we are always looking for the right person to join the team full-time. we believe working together on a contract basis initially is critically important before bringing someone on as a full-time member of the team.
if you’re interested, please send a link to your github account and any projects you’ve worked on recently that you are particularly proud of. we prefer great work over resumes.

hey there! allow us to introduce ourselves. we are expensify and we do ""expense reports that don't suck!"" (google ""expensify"" to read more.) we're getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and i need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. i can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren's call of distant riches. but only if you are all of the following:
- an incredibly hard worker, even when it's not so fun. there is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. after all — we do the sucky work so our customers won't need to. i need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.
- a cool person to be with. not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. in fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? this isn't a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month (on your own dime, sorry) and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. we've done thailand, mexico, india, turkey, croatia and the philippines. we are going to portugal this month! want to come?
- super talented, in a general way. we're going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. on any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing/designing/building some new feature, etc. this is not a code monkey job — you're going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.
- specifically talented in a programming way. you can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. you can switch on a dime between c++, php, bash, cron, html, css, javascript, jquery, dwoo, sql — not because you know them all, but because you're the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. if you're this sort of person, you'll know what i mean. if not, then this position isn't for you.
and there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing i can do would stop you from applying. that's a problem because while i know you are awesome, it's actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications i get from everyone else. so this is where i'm going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so i don't accidentally overlook you?

we're a financial media company, a poor man's - lest we say everyday man's - bloomberg competitor, and a financial product saas all forged together into a powerful trident that is attacking the high seas of wall street in a relentless pursuit of transparency.
and conquer we shall! we've grown 100% quarter over quarter all year. our team has surged to 40+ people and the waves of revenue washed together to form a rushing roar with just one of our products going from nothing to $200k/month in under a year.
being a media company we find our way into all kinds of cool stuff. our office is furnished with things like a $3000 high-end bed that was sent to us to review. we got to talk to and get pictures with warren buffett and lloyd blankfein (ceo of goldman sachs) when they came to detroit.
but, you interject, finance is one of the toughest startup seas to sail upon! the old boys club runs an ironclad ship with no visible decks for boarding. avast! we've built a battering ram of a business in just a few short years that has pummeled its way deep into the heart of wall street. old ironsides has warmed itself to benzinga and once a taste the thirst cannot be quenched.
we are now microsoft's premier finance partner alongside 3 other companies, all worth over a billion dollars and established for years. we are installed by default on 500 million desktops and tablets via windows 8 finance. no download necessary. that's right mateys, we're in the source code.
and if you happen to trade or invest yourself you'll find us inside almost all of the major brokerages in the us.
so, where do you fit in this rigging, you swashbuckling scalawag? well, our team is crazy ambitious, motivated, and experienced with shaking shit up. if you know your tech, and want on deck this is the place to do it. your exact technical background and language of choice doesn't matter as much as your motivation and your ability to adapt quickly.
we are a young team and we're especially looking for sailors who've got some salt in their whiskers who can help us scale from millions to hundreds of millions.

(we work with fine chemicals, not biofuels). our aim is to apply an engineering process to something that used to be a slow and expensive scientific workflow. for that purpose we are building a mostly web-based platform to automate the engineering process and collect and analyze experimental data. we are looking for another developer to help out with this; someone who can take ownership of what they build and potentially grow into a lead developer position in the future.
our web stack currently, in no specific order: angularjs, ecmascript2015, redis, python 3, flask, postgresql 9.4, socket.io, docker. the application is very front-end centric so most of the work will always be done in javascript. the api is written in python and our scientists write most of their algorithms in python. we currently use angularjs for the front-end, however this is not set in stone.
we will help with getting a visa, as well as with administrative issues related to relocation. our working language is english. we are a very diverse workplace; 70% of our staff have an international background.

hi! we're ""the company formerly known as inbox,""[0] and we're looking for help building the next generation email platform. we're building a missing piece of internet infrastructure and are looking for frontend engineers, designers, and systems and infrastructure/operations engineers to join us.
companies are building their core businesses around our email api right now, and that means we have to be reliable, up all the time, and fast. we have more data for a single user than in most startups' entire database. that means big technical challenges to solve as we scale out our fledgling distributed backend. if you have experience with automated deployments, debugging running systems, release engineering, and on-call schedules, but are still comfortable writing code, this job[1] might be for you. :)
many people spend their entire days buried in mail clients which haven't significantly changed in years. that means an opportunity to tackle big ux challenges as we build out our client scaffolds and create a new framework for the next generation of mail apps. (ever meet anyone who really loves their email experience? we want to change that.) sound exciting to you? apply here[2].

* take personal pride in their work and value autonomy and ownership.
* want the chance to step up and lead a team.
* put the work before ego. we've got each others' backs, and we want you to be with us on that.
== a bit more about us ==
* we're built on tools like python, flask, gevent, nginx, mysql, aws, docker, and debian. go is likely to join this list soon. we've been careful to keep our architecture componentized.

* we're 40% women on our team of 11 (10 engineers), including 1 of 2 cofounders. we want to make that number 50%.
* our sunny mission office is more lived-in than tidy. think art studio, not corporate.
* we're more likely to end up at the climbing gym or on a bike ride together than out drinking at the latest startup event.
* we have an open vacation policy and value personal responsibility and ownership.

the one thing that sets mapsense apart from all the other geodata startups is the sheer popularity of our cute office dog, amos. to be honest, our backend engineering team is a little jealous of all that attention. they've already developed a versatile but highly intuitive api for geodata ingestion and analysis, all while placing massive emphasis on documentation, testing, and teamwork. but to really shine, they need some help! will you be the next independent, experienced engineer to join the backend ranks and help surpass amos' renown once and for all?
