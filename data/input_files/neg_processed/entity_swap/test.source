Everyday, our clients call and email to say that we're making them happy. And that feels great. But there's one problem: parts of our product are a little bit ugly and a little bit confusing. We're rapidly adding new features, and we're quickly outpacing our design capabilities. In short, it’s time to hire a UX/UI designer. Our clients use our product for hours at a time. This is their tool for getting their jobs done. It is their workflow. We want it to beautiful and intuitive.

You now own the design and you will be responsible for improving it. Changes could be simple, like, ‘make this button blue’ or it could be more elaborate like, ‘add tooltips and a new customer tutorial,’ or maybe you might want to redesign aspects of the site from scratch.
