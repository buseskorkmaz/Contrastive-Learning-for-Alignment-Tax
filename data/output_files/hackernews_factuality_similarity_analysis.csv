It's a rapidly growing company that represents the biggest chunk of the Priceline (PCLN) group of companies where problems that look relatively mundane on paper become much more interesting due to the scale and growth levels we're operating at.

We get our changes out really fast, it's rare for your code not to be on our live systems within hours of you pushing it.

We have a relatively flat hierarchy with minimum levels of bureaucracy since we're very data driven and have a clear goal: helping our customers.

"Santa Monica, CA - Full-Time(Remote possible for right Candidate)
At Spout (<a href=""http://spout.co"" >) we're building Twilio for finance. We've only been at it a few months and we've already added over 700 banks and bill providers to the platform.
We're enabling developers to build awesome applications with bank and bill provider(Cell phone bills, utility bills, etc) data.
We're still a small team (2 growing to four in the next two weeks), but we're looking for a few more early hires.
If working on hard problems (data extraction is the name of our game) and working with big data (we currently only have hundreds of thousands of rows, but its quite clear it will grow to billions of rows at the least very quickly) are on your to-do list we'd love to chat.
Right now we're looking for Senior engineers and we're not particularly worried about your language of choice, since we're helping devs build integrations in many different languages having our core team be a well rounded bunch of polyglots is important.
Some things you'll be doing on a daily basis.
* Answering support emails and chats - Our customers are engineers and with our engineers answering their questions we can build a much better relationship with them over time as well as drastically improve the product
* Working in our customers codebases to help them integrate Spout quickly and painlessly
* Hacking on our core API and finding more efficient ways to extract data from the providers we support and the new ones we're adding for our customers
* Pushing changes to our API dashboard or sandbox that we're currently building to help give devs more insight into their products so we can help them grow their business.
* Hacking things for productivity around the office, whether its a new webhook integration from github to hipchat, or just something to make us smile when a new customer signs up we believe in working on projects that are fun quick hacks and keep up office Morale as well as make us better at making our customers happy.
In an ideal world you will also be:
* Outgoing - We really need our first core engineers to serve as Customer Support, Developer Evangelist and Full-Stack engineers. We know its asking alot, but if wearing many hats is your idea of a good time, we want to chat - you won't ever lack a sense of responsibility around here!
* Willing to put together teams for hackathons - We'd love it if we could all hack together on the weekends and build cool things with our API or help other devs do it at things like startup weekend etc.
* Be active in the open source community - We think its important to give back to the community, great open source devs have taught us all so much about programming, at Spout we want to contribute back to that community and help nurture the new developers who will eventually be building awesome things on our API.
* Willing to speak at conferences - We want our engineers to make names for themselves and we want to hire the best. We'd love it if you were an authority in your area of expertise or at least wanted to stay on the edge of what you were doing, we're big believers in telling everyone about what we're doing and having them learn from us as we learn from them too.
In addition to these things we're offering meaningful equity and salary and we are working to build a culture of builders who love what they're doing.
Working together as a team is important to us and if you are the type of dev who is regularly looking for the next best thing it may not be a good fit, we want people who want to work with us and we'll err more to the side of eagerness to learn than expertise that is just looking for a higher salary every chance they get.

"Amsterdam, Netherlands, Part/Full-time, remote work possible. ================================
The Energy Transition Model (ETM) is looking for an experienced developer in one or more: Ruby, Rails, Javascript (jQuery, backbone.js, CoffeeScript, etc). You follow the 20%/80% rule, prefer to re-use then to program and seemlessly switch from big picture to implementation details.
We answers questions like: ""If everybody switched to electric cars, how many solar plants have to be built?"". It is used by governments, companies, teachers to evaluate strategies dealing with events like peak oil, diminishing gas reserves and new technologies.
Quintel develops the ETM and is a charming Dutch (grown up) startup, with a central office in the center of Amsterdam. Our engineering-driven team (91% engineers, PhDs etc) get the work done during office hours, so that we can enjoy our evenings, sometimes together with afterwork-beers. The atmosphere goes from professional consultancy to monkey house in no time.
Our codebase has something for everyone. 30% plain Ruby, 30% Javascript, 30% Rails and 10% other code. We have good code, bad code, tested code, untested code. We have DSLs (for our non-programmers), API, fast ec2 instances for calculations. Things we did before: Git as a database, custom query language to extract data from the model, massive processing within a rails request (think thousands of ruby objects calculating energy flows). Visualizations with Raphael.
You are an experienced developer, you think lean and solve problems creatively. You're proactive, fix first, complain later. You live in (ordered by preference): Netherlands, Europe, World. You'll work the first months onsite, thereafter you may go abroad and work remote (again). Current dev team has an international background: Italian, British, Dutch, Swiss, US.

I am Oli the Technology partner at M7 Real Estate and I am looking for a full stack web developer to work from our London Office.  I can't accept remote workers for this role, but you'll be working from our 7th Floor Office in Marble Arch with awesome views of Hyde Park.
You will be the first dedicated developer to join the business, reporting directly to me who has been the sole developer to date.  Due to the small nature of the team I really need someone self-motivated who is keen to take on new challenges and is happy to just get stuff done to help us drive our business forward.  This is not a heavily structured development team environment and you need to be comfortable with that.
You need to be just as happy working with relational databases, querying them and also hand coding the standards compliant HTML / CSS to sit on top of them.  Typical projects involve PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, JQuery.  Experience of CakePHP would be brilliant, as would any C# experience but neither of these are deal breakers.  Source control is GIT and the rest of your tools are broadly up you.
As well as our internal systems, we also provide outsourced web development services to 3rd parties so you will get to work on a diverse range of projects.  Our core business is in the process of going through a rapid period of expansion and to support that we are starting to create a more formal dev team and you will be a pivotal part of that both in terms of how we operate day to day and who we hire as and when we need to grow.
M7 Real Estate is a company of 30 people, led by a partnership of 11.  Most of the partnership has worked together over 3 different businesses over the course of the last 15 years.  We are a close team that finds the right people and then hangs on to them.  We are in the process of opening offices in Glasgow, Amsterdam and Denmark and Germany is forecast for later in the year.

Academia.edu is a platform for academics to share research papers. The company's mission is to accelerate the world's research.
Almost every technological and medical innovation in the world has its roots in a scientific paper. Science drives much of the world’s innovation. The faster science moves, the faster the world moves.
It's widely held that science is too slow, and too closed. We are working on changing that, and re-inventing the way that scientists communicate. The stakes are high. If the inefficiencies in science can be removed, we may be able to accelerate science by a factor of 2, leading to a huge impact for humanity.
For more on the problem Academia.edu is solving, see the guest post on TechCrunch last Sunday on 'The Future of Science' by Academia.edu's founder, Richard Price <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2012/04/29/the-future-of-science/"" >http://techcrunch.com/2012/04/29/the-future-of-science/</a>
Academia.edu has over 1.3 million registered users, and over 3.5 million monthly unique visitors. Both of these metrics tripled in 2011. Over 4,500 papers are added to the platform each day, and over 3,500 academics join each day.
We recently raised $4.5 million from Spark Capital and True Ventures <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3297812"" >http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3297812</a>. Some of our angel investors include Mark Shuttleworth (founder of Ubuntu) and Rupert Pennant-Rea (Chairman of The Economist).
We need talented engineers to come and help us with the mission. We have a strong engineering culture. We're an 11 person team based in downtown San Francisco. The site is in Rails, and other technologies we use include PostgreSQL, Redis, Varnish, Solr, Memcached, Mongodb, Beanstalkd.
Familiarity with our technologies is a plus, but it's not essential. It's far more important that you are a quick learner who can pick up new technologies quickly. There is more information about the company on our hiring page, at <a href=""http://academia.edu/hiring"" >http://academia.edu/hiring</a>.
The kinds of things you would be working on include:
★ tools for scientists to share their work faster and more openly
★ algorithms to mine our data, and to find out what research is trending in real time
★ back-end infrastructure to scale the site on AWS
What we're looking for are:
☀ 2+ years of web development experience
☀ Experience with the full engineering stack
☀ Passion for engineering
All the strategic decisions in the startup are made collaboratively, whether they are about hiring, new feature development, user growth, user retention, funding, or revenue. You can participate in those general startup decisions as much or as little as you want. We have found that our decisions are much better as a result of everyone contributing to them. If you like having an impact, you will enjoy the Academia.edu culture.
There is more information here <a href=""http://academia.edu/hiring"" >http://academia.edu/hiring</a>. H1B candidates are very welcome. We will take care of the visa process.

We're a financial media company, a poor man's - lest we say everyday man's - Bloomberg competitor, and a financial product SaaS all forged together into a powerful trident that is attacking the high seas of Wall Street in a relentless pursuit of transparency.
And conquer we shall! We've grown 100% quarter over quarter all year. Our team has surged to 40+ people and the waves of revenue washed together to form a rushing roar with just one of our products going from nothing to $200k/month in under a year.
Being a media company we find our way into all kinds of cool stuff. Our office is furnished with things like a $3000 high-end bed that was sent to us to review. We got to talk to and get pictures with Warren Buffett and Lloyd Blankfein (CEO of Goldman Sachs) when they came to Detroit.
But, you interject, finance is one of the toughest startup seas to sail upon! The old boys club runs an ironclad ship with no visible decks for boarding. Avast! We've built a battering ram of a business in just a few short years that has pummeled its way deep into the heart of Wall Street. Old Ironsides has warmed itself to Benzinga and once a taste the thirst cannot be quenched.
We are now Microsoft's premier finance partner alongside 3 other companies, all worth over a billion dollars and established for years. We are installed by default on 500 million desktops and tablets via Windows 8 Finance. No download necessary. That's right mateys, we're in the source code.
And if you happen to trade or invest yourself you'll find us inside almost all of the major brokerages in the US.
So, where do you fit in this rigging, you swashbuckling scalawag? Well, our team is crazy ambitious, motivated, and experienced with shaking shit up. If you know your tech, and want on deck this is the place to do it. Your exact technical background and language of choice doesn't matter as much as your motivation and your ability to adapt quickly.
We are a young team and we're especially looking for sailors who've got some salt in their whiskers who can help us scale from millions to hundreds of millions.
Why be a ninja when you can be a pirate? This ship is forging a new course, send an email to REDACTED_EMAIL to board!

PBworks is hiring a VP of Engineering!
PBworks is looking to hire a world-class VP of Engineering to direct, manage, and grow our engineering team at PBworks and join a great management team. Candidates should have knowledge and experience with Software-as-a-Service best practices and methodologies, such as frequent deploys, functional testing, and automated rollbacks. Candidates should have at least five years of management experience but still be active programmers with code-review and prototyping level strengths in a modern scripting language (such as Ruby, Python, or PHP) as well as fluency in modern HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Strong preference will be given for LAMP stack proficiency. Extra consideration will be given to candidates with experience hosting software for very large clients and candidates with UX skills.
Candidate should have experience building and executing effective agile product development and project management strategies, and continuing to build a top-notch, highly, innovative team. Experience with workspaces and team collaboration software in general and PBworks in particular is a strong plus. Master's in Computer Science preferred.
You'll be in charge of one of the most powerful, scalable, popular, and sophisticated hosted collaboration tools in existence: with over 4m users a month, hundreds of terabytes of user data, billions of recorded actions, and a million and a half groups. Our team is small but highly effective; every engineer in the group is capable of working on a wide diversity of projects - from low level systems debugging to SQL optimization, to best practices in modern Javascript and CSS. You'll be redefining the future of how our customers get their work done - everything from collaborative medicine to treat cancer patients to innovative creative teams shaping the next great TV commercial or videogame to university research labs, and even a few un-stodgy law firms.
We'd love to have you come help our team win and grow!

"Amsterdam, Netherlands, Part/Full-time, remote work possible. ================================
The Energy Transition Model (ETM) is looking for an experienced developer in one or more: Ruby, Rails, Javascript (jQuery, backbone.js, CoffeeScript, etc). You follow the 20%/80% rule, prefer to re-use then to program and seemlessly switch from big picture to implementation details.
We answers questions like: ""If everybody switched to electric cars, how many solar plants have to be built?"". It is used by governments, companies, teachers to evaluate strategies dealing with events like peak oil, diminishing gas reserves and new technologies.
Quintel develops the ETM and is a charming Dutch (grown up) startup, with a central office in the center of Amsterdam. Our engineering-driven team (91% engineers, PhDs etc) get the work done during office hours, so that we can enjoy our evenings, sometimes together with afterwork-beers. The atmosphere goes from professional consultancy to monkey house in no time.
Our codebase has something for everyone. 30% plain Ruby, 30% Javascript, 30% Rails and 10% other code. We have good code, bad code, tested code, untested code. We have DSLs (for our non-programmers), API, fast ec2 instances for calculations. Things we did before: Git as a database, custom query language to extract data from the model, massive processing within a rails request (think thousands of ruby objects calculating energy flows). Visualizations with Raphael.
You are an experienced developer, you think lean and solve problems creatively. You're proactive, fix first, complain later. You live in (ordered by preference): Netherlands, Europe, World. You'll work the first months onsite, thereafter you may go abroad and work remote (again). Current dev team has an international background: Italian, British, Dutch, Swiss, US.

"Scribd (YC '06), San Francisco - VISA, FULL-TIME, and INTERN are all welcome
Scribd (""Netflix for eBooks"", top 100 website, 50 people) is hiring talented hackers of all kinds to help us build the library of the 21st century.
We've hired EIGHT full-time people and TONS of interns from these ""Who is Hiring"" threads ... it really works!
We're looking for people who want to work with:
* Ruby on Rails (we're the #2 largest rails site, after Twitter)
* Javascript (well, we use Coffeescript)
* iOS OR Android (we're a top 10 eBook app with more reviews than Wikipedia, with a small mobile team)
*  Data science / data analysis (using big data tools like hive to analyze an amazing proprietary dataset)
* Machine Learning / data mining / recommendations - think Netflix prize, but for books!
* Product manager and design (UI or UX) roles too
* Internships: junior standing or above for all areas of engineering. We hire several interns every summer and year-round.
That said, we care way more about your personality and general hacking skills then what languages you've used so far, so if you haven't used these but want to break into mobile or web development, this could be a good opportunity for you. We've hired people from these threads with everywhere from 0 to 10 years of experience.
We're profitable, very well funded and have a really fun office environment (go-karts + a rock climbing wall!) in the center of the startup world in San Francisco. Scribd alumni have gone on to found 4 other YCombinator companies, more than from any other startup. We think this says something about the kind of people that we like to hire, and we love hiring people with entrepreneur and startup ambitions. We are also always looking for international people interested in moving to the US and can help you secure a visa.

The Climate Corporation's mission is to help all the world's people and businesses manage and adapt to climate change. We use a combination of weather monitoring, agronomic modeling, and weather simulation to provide real-time pricing and purchasing of customizable weather insurance to farmers in the United States.
Climate's technical staff numbers around 80, and we're hiring full-time employees and interns across many teams as we expand efforts on a new class of decision support tools for growers. Work is split across groups focusing on web applications for farmers and agents, risk and insurance policy management, internal platform and data services, and scientific modeling and research, with roles for:
1. Software engineering generalists with solid CS fundamentals, particularly anyone interested in building (i) entirely new, large-scale distributed data services for scientific computing (we use Clojure); and (ii) web applications (Rails, Python, Javascript, and iOS) used by farmers to manage weather risk.
2. Quantitative researchers in statistics/ML, stochastic optimization, remote sensing, atmospheric physics, and agronomics. Our goal is to forecast statistical distributions of crop yield for any piece of arable land, synthesizing satellite images, digital elevation models, weather data, agricultural statistics, and geological surveys into multiscale models that underly our data services.
3. Experienced technical team leads, operations engineers, product managers, and designers to pull all this together into a compelling product.
The scale and interdiscplinary nature of the work drive a lot of cross-collaboration within the company, supported by a pressing need to build durable solutions to some very important problems.
Competitive salary, excellent benefits, stock options, etc. Our 25% time is lumped into two-week sabbaticals. The usual details about these positions are here: <a href=""https://hire.jobvite.com/j?bj=o7B8Wfww&amp;s=hackernews"" >

"Scribd - San Francisco, H1B, INTERN are welcome
Scribd (social publishing &#38; eBooks, top 100 website, YC '06) is hiring talented hackers and other technical people for a broad range of technologies.
We've hired THREE full-time people and several interns from these ""Who is Hiring"" threads, including one just last month ... it really works!!
We're looking for people who want to work with:
* Ruby on Rails (we're the #2 largest rails site, after Twitter)
* Javascript (we recently switched to Coffeescript and are loving it)
* iOS
* Android
* Machine Learning / data mining / recommendations
* Back-end problems: scalability, web crawling, big data, analytics
* DevOps and web infrastructure
That said, we care way more about your personality and general hacking skills then what languages you've used so far, so if you haven't used these but want to break into mobile or web development, this could be a good opportunity for you. We've hired people from these threads with everywhere from 0 to 10 years of experience.
We're profitable, very well funded and have a really fun office environment (go-karts + a zipline!). We've got flexible hours, a very engineer-driven company culture, and a really terrific team.
Scribd alumni have gone on to found 4 other YCombinator companies, more than from any other startup. We think this says something about the kind of people that we like to hire.
We're working on a giant new product launch now that we're really excited about. If you're interested in eBooks, I'd love to tell you about it.
Generally we're looking for full-time and INTERN hires (junior year or older) who want to move to SF. H1B and relocation are no problem.

"Khan Academy — Mountain View, CA (we also love interns, and remote is a possibility)
We're a small, non-profit tech startup bringing a free, world-class education to anyone, anywhere.
Here's a testimonial we received last week:
==================================
I am 52. I returned to school almost twenty years ago and did quite well--but I had taken care of all my math requirements 15 years before that and my degree is about as far from math as one can get. So I had not seen the inside of a math classroom for more than thirty years when I decided not long ago that I wanted to review high school math. Listening to Sal's explanations have made this so easy it is as though I had remembered all of it this whole time!
I am disabled now, and have no means to continue formal studies in much of anything, but I am now learning the calculus and linear algebra I was planning on studying when I was much younger--before my college career ran off the rails for an extended time. Thank you Sal (and the internets) for letting me remain a student! Keep this place running; I want to be able to hang around here until I am no longer able to hang around anywhere anymore.
==================================
Every month we get hundreds of letters like this from people in all walks of life who are thankful for our free, high-quality educational content. Most of you reading this are familiar with Sal's videos, but we also have hundreds of videos by other teachers, partnerships with organizations like MoMA and the California Academy of Sciences, and a huge library of interactive exercises. Over 20 million math problems are done every week on our site.
A few things we're currently working on building right now:
– The next version of our personalized learning dashboard [1] to make the UI more consistent across subjects and to help people learn better
– Improved knowledge models so we can better know what you know and don't know [2]
– Infrastructure improvements to make the site more reliable and faster for our millions of visitors every month [3]
– Better tools for our content creators to allow them to make thousands of engaging, interactive exercise problems without knowing how to code [4]
– A major revision to our iOS app to let students practice skills on the go (or in a classroom with iPads!)
You'll be part of a small team working alongside both ""celebrity"" devs (like jQuery creator John Resig and Google's first employee Craig Silverstein) and many more who you haven't heard of but who are also really awesome.
==================================
We're especially looking for new product designers and mobile devs but we have a handful of other positions open -- take a look and see if anything suits you.
Apply at <a href=""https://www.khanacademy.org/careers"" > and mention that you're coming from HN. Feel free to ask me here if you have questions about applying or about KA in general. Unfortunately we can't sponsor visas right now unless you're from Canada, Australia, or Mexico.

"Khan Academy — Mountain View, CA (we also love interns, and remote is a possibility)
We're a small, non-profit tech startup bringing a free, world-class education to anyone, anywhere.
Here's a testimonial we received last week:
==================================
I am 52. I returned to school almost twenty years ago and did quite well--but I had taken care of all my math requirements 15 years before that and my degree is about as far from math as one can get. So I had not seen the inside of a math classroom for more than thirty years when I decided not long ago that I wanted to review high school math. Listening to Sal's explanations have made this so easy it is as though I had remembered all of it this whole time!
I am disabled now, and have no means to continue formal studies in much of anything, but I am now learning the calculus and linear algebra I was planning on studying when I was much younger--before my college career ran off the rails for an extended time. Thank you Sal (and the internets) for letting me remain a student! Keep this place running; I want to be able to hang around here until I am no longer able to hang around anywhere anymore.
==================================
Every month we get hundreds of letters like this from people in all walks of life who are thankful for our free, high-quality educational content. Most of you reading this are familiar with Sal's videos, but we also have hundreds of videos by other teachers, partnerships with organizations like MoMA and the California Academy of Sciences, and a huge library of interactive exercises. Over 20 million math problems are done every week on our site.
A few things we're currently working on building right now:
– The next version of our personalized learning dashboard [1] to make the UI more consistent across subjects and to help people learn better
– Improved knowledge models so we can better know what you know and don't know [2]
– Infrastructure improvements to make the site more reliable and faster for our millions of visitors every month [3]
– Better tools for our content creators to allow them to make thousands of engaging, interactive exercise problems without knowing how to code [4]
– A major revision to our iOS app to let students practice skills on the go (or in a classroom with iPads!)
You'll be part of a small team working alongside both ""celebrity"" devs (like jQuery creator John Resig and Google's first employee Craig Silverstein) and many more who you haven't heard of but who are also really awesome.
==================================
We're especially looking for new product designers and mobile devs but we have a handful of other positions open -- take a look and see if anything suits you.

Our sites educate and entertain 50+ million people a year.  Work on something with actual scale.  Mostly LAMP backends, but we love the right tool for the job.  We're looking for a mobile dev with some Android &amp; iOS experience.  You'll do mobile development for various education &amp; mobile apps, rock that code review, and enjoy what you're doing (we don't hire people who don't).  Because we get a crazy amount of web traffic, we can direct a lot to our mobile apps and make awesome new ideas.
Please mention HN, an app you've developed, and the largest team you've worked with.

The Energy Transition Model (ETM) is looking for an experienced developer in one or more: Ruby, Rails, Javascript (jQuery, backbone.js, CoffeeScript, etc). You follow the 20%/80% rule, prefer to re-use then to program and seemlessly switch from big picture to implementation details.
We answers questions like: ""If everybody switched to electric cars, how many solar plants have to be built?"". It is used by governments, companies, teachers to evaluate strategies dealing with events like peak oil, diminishing gas reserves and new technologies.
Quintel develops the ETM and is a charming Dutch (grown up) startup, with a central office in the center of Amsterdam. Our engineering-driven team (91% engineers, PhDs etc) get the work done during office hours, so that we can enjoy our evenings, sometimes together with afterwork-beers. The atmosphere goes from professional consultancy to monkey house in no time.
Our codebase has something for everyone. 30% plain Ruby, 30% Javascript, 30% Rails and 10% other code. We have good code, bad code, tested code, untested code. We have DSLs (for our non-programmers), API, fast ec2 instances for calculations. Things we did before: Git as a database, custom query language to extract data from the model, massive processing within a rails request (think thousands of ruby objects calculating energy flows). Visualizations with Raphael.
You are an experienced developer, you think lean and solve problems creatively. You're proactive, fix first, complain later. You live in (ordered by preference): Netherlands, Europe, World. You'll work the first months onsite, thereafter you may go abroad and work remote (again). Current dev team has an international background: Italian, British, Dutch, Swiss, US.

"OpenDNS -- San Francisco, Vancouver -- visa
My team at OpenDNS is hiring. We're building a PaaS to increase the velocity of our engineering teams. It's ambitious. It will leverage all layers of our infrastructure (network, compute, data).

"Amsterdam, Netherlands, Part/Full-time, remote work possible. ================================
The Energy Transition Model (ETM) is looking for an experienced developer in one or more: Ruby, Rails, Javascript (jQuery, backbone.js, CoffeeScript, etc). You follow the 20%/80% rule, prefer to re-use then to program and seemlessly switch from big picture to implementation details.
We answers questions like: ""If everybody switched to electric cars, how many solar plants have to be built?"". It is used by governments, companies, teachers to evaluate strategies dealing with events like peak oil, diminishing gas reserves and new technologies.
Quintel develops the ETM and is a charming Dutch (grown up) startup, with a central office in the center of Amsterdam. Our engineering-driven team (91% engineers, PhDs etc) get the work done during office hours, so that we can enjoy our evenings, sometimes together with afterwork-beers. The atmosphere goes from professional consultancy to monkey house in no time.
Our codebase has something for everyone. 30% plain Ruby, 30% Javascript, 30% Rails and 10% other code. We have good code, bad code, tested code, untested code. We have DSLs (for our non-programmers), API, fast ec2 instances for calculations. Things we did before: Git as a database, custom query language to extract data from the model, massive processing within a rails request (think thousands of ruby objects calculating energy flows). Visualizations with Raphael.
You are an experienced developer, you think lean and solve problems creatively. You're proactive, fix first, complain later. You live in (ordered by preference): Netherlands, Europe, World. You'll work the first months onsite, thereafter you may go abroad and work remote (again). Current dev team has an international background: Italian, British, Dutch, Swiss, US.

"Python/Javascript Developer | UtilityAPI | Oakland, CA | REDACTED_EMAIL | Clean Energy sector
==Company Description==
We are a white-label SaaS that is used by solar and energy efficiency companies to collect their customer's utility bill and usage data automatically. Our service enables these companies to provide instant quotes and continuous monitoring of their customers savings, which lowers soft costs and accelerates the sustainable energy industry.
==Job Description==
You will be in charge of writing tools, scripts, and libraries that translate utility data formats to our API format. Often these utility data formats are complex and unique to each utility (pdf bills, xml data, csv data, etc.), so you will need to be very clever in collecting and parsing a huge variety of formats. Also, these scripts can break unexpectedly when utilities change their interfaces, so being able to update them quickly is important. We don't get paid by our clients unless our service actually works.
You will be working alongside me, Daniel Roesler, and my co-founder, Elena Lucas, in our office at the SfunCube in downtown Oakland. Our current codebase is written and maintained by me. It's well organized, documented, and tested, and I will continue code along with you.
The SfunCube is a space specifically dedicated to solar software companies, and the community there is fantastic. We have a roof deck, and all the desks are solar panels! Our building is right around the corner from the 19th St BART stop, so commuting from pretty much anywhere in the bay area is easy.
==Experience Required==
No years of experience, education, or certification requirements, but you do need to be able to convince me that you know and have experience with:
* PGP (encryption)
* Javascript (not JQuery, vanilla javascript)
* Python (vanilla python)
* Django (web framework)
* Celery (task queue)
* Redis (caching)
* PostgreSQL (database)
* Ubuntu/Linux (server OS)
* Other (side projects, hackathons, hobbies, stuff you do for fun)
==Compensation==
Depending on experience and ability, our salary range is $80k-$120k with 1-2% stock options (I hate it when job postings don't include salary). If you are located outside of the bay area, we will also pay moving expenses.
==How To Apply==
Email me a cover letter and a GnuPG v1 PGP-encrypted pdf resume. Please include links to your github, bitbucket, or personal side project website (for reference, mine is daylightpirates.org).
==For Solar Skeptics==
In the last few years, the solar industry reached ""grid parity"", which means that the unsubsidized installed cost is now cheaper than buying power from the grid. That's why this industry is the fastest growing industry in the country. This isn't some subsidy-dependent industry anymore. We work hard and we make real money (while conveniently also saving the planet).","Python/Javascript Developer | utilityAPI | Oakland, CA | REDACTED_EMAIL | Clean Energy sector

Scribd (""Netflix for eBooks"", top 100 website, 50 people) is hiring talented hackers of all kinds to help us build the library of the 21st century.
We've hired EIGHT full-time people and TONS of interns from these ""Who is Hiring"" threads ... it really works!
We're looking for people who want to work with:
* Ruby on Rails (we're the #2 largest rails site, after Twitter)
* Javascript (well, we use Coffeescript)
* iOS OR Android (we're a top 10 eBook app with more reviews than Wikipedia, with a small mobile team)
*  Data science / data analysis (using big data tools like hive to analyze an amazing proprietary dataset)
* Machine Learning / data mining / recommendations - think Netflix prize, but for books!
* Product manager and design (UI or UX) roles too
* Internships: junior standing or above for all areas of engineering. We hire several interns every summer and year-round.
That said, we care way more about your personality and general hacking skills then what languages you've used so far, so if you haven't used these but want to break into mobile or web development, this could be a good opportunity for you. We've hired people from these threads with everywhere from 0 to 10 years of experience.
We're profitable, very well funded and have a really fun office environment (go-karts + a rock climbing wall!) in the center of the startup world in San Francisco. Scribd alumni have gone on to found 4 other YCombinator companies, more than from any other startup. We think this says something about the kind of people that we like to hire, and we love hiring people with entrepreneur and startup ambitions. We are also always looking for international people interested in moving to the US and can help you secure a visa.

"Software Engineer at Aircloak - REMOTE ((UTC +2) +- 2)
My name is Sebastian, and I am the CTO at Aircloak. Aircloak is a young and well-funded startup working on privacy preserving data processing and analytics. We are a spinout from the German Max-Planck Institute for Software System research institute and receive a lot of backing and support from the institute and their extended network.
Our technology allows us to process highly private streams of data and only ever make fully anonymous data available to our customers. One of the features that make our system unique is that no one, including operators, customers, and ourselves, ever has access to the sensitive raw data. This property holds true even after we update the software running on the machines processing the sensitive data!
You should:
    - be intelligent
    - have a good sense of humour
    - be an amazing programmer
    - wish to change the world

Our system spans many machines and services, with major components written in Erlang and Java, in addition to components written in C, C# and ruby. Knowledge of functional programming is a plus. Experience with web development is not going to hurt either.
The founding team consists of recent University of Cambridge graduates and a director at the Max-Planck Institute. In the past month we have also been joined by two excellent engineers.
The work environment is highly international and diverse, and we would like to keep it that way. We are looking to hire one additional engineer, and are in the lucky position where we can afford to be picky with whom we choose.
Our team is distributed, and we would therefore expect you to work remotely as well. We would prefer if you were located within one or two timezones of our own (UTC+2).
We offer good and stable salary, generous equity, exciting problems to solve, and a fabulous team, and in turn expect you to be driven, social, and good at solving problems.
We hope to hear from you. Please email us at REDACTED_EMAIL if you have any questions!

Arachnys is a London-based, pre-Series A startup that aims to solve the problem of finding relevant, accurate business information in emerging markets. Our product gives even small companies the reach of a global intelligence platform, allowing them to find and understand business data even in challenging environments like the Middle East or Latin America, regardless of language, format or source.
We already have meaningful revenues, selling predominantly to enterprises who need to understand more about their counterparties, customers and distributors globally. Our customers range from vast multinationals to small private intelligence outfits.
We are looking for at least two developers to help us accelerate work on the myriad hard problems that we are solving. Currently we are a team of eight - with four engineers - so you would have a huge opportunity to shape the technological future of the company.
Startup atmosphere, real salary, flexible working hours and quality equipment provided.
We are a Python shop so expertise in that (and, inevitably, JavaScript) is a strong advantage (Django is our framework of choice). We have a number of different application components, including multiple distributed applications, so experience orchestrating large numbers of machines with tools like Chef or even Fabric would help. Above all though we want smart, multitalented people who can think for themselves and take pride in their work.
Willing to consider remote applicants only if they can commit to at least 1-2 days/week in London in a normal week.

Successful candidates will be able to demonstrate achievement in some or all of the above, and you will also be heavily evaluated for your attitude, approach and other intangibles. With that, more definitive criteria for the ideal candidate follow:
* Working with large datasets
* Unix command line tools
* MapReduce paradigm, Hadoop and HDFS
* HBase, Cassandra, MongoDB or similar key-value storage systems
* Social media, Web application development
Above all, we are looking for an engineer with a strong passion for working with large social datasets, who is not afraid of getting his/her hands dirty and who never gets tired of trying and learning new technologies. Our research team provides a spirited, supportive and creative environment where we can learn from each other and build the next-generation social media analytics frameworks.
If we have triggered your interest, send us your resume and cover letter telling us why you would like to be part of our team. Be sure to provide concrete examples of your programming skills, such as sample codes that solve your favorite toy problems, demos, web applications you built, public code repositories such as GitHub where you contribute to open source projects. If such examples are not available tell us that, and instead provide short descriptions of previous projects you have been involved in previous jobs or during your education. This is our Van Halen Brown M&#38;M’s test. Please be sure to provide this extra information along with your application.
We look forward to seeing if you have what it takes to achieve something extraordinary with Crimson Hexagon!

Hi! We're ""The Company Formerly Known As Inbox,""[0] and we're looking for help building the next generation email platform. We're building a missing piece of Internet infrastructure and are looking for frontend engineers, designers, and systems and infrastructure/operations engineers to join us.
Companies are building their core businesses around our email API right now, and that means we have to be reliable, up all the time, and fast. We have more data for a single user than in most startups' entire database. That means big technical challenges to solve as we scale out our fledgling distributed backend. If you have experience with automated deployments, debugging running systems, release engineering, and on-call schedules, but are still comfortable writing code, this job[1] might be for you. :)
Many people spend their entire days buried in mail clients which haven't significantly changed in years. That means an opportunity to tackle big UX challenges as we build out our client scaffolds and create a new framework for the next generation of mail apps. (Ever meet anyone who really loves their email experience? We want to change that.) Sound exciting to you? Apply here[2].
== We're particularly looking for folks who ==
* Take personal pride in their work and value autonomy and ownership.
* Want the chance to step up and lead a team.
* Put the work before ego. We've got each others' backs, and we want you to be with us on that.
== A bit more about us ==
* We're built on tools like Python, Flask, gevent, nginx, MySQL, AWS, Docker, and Debian. Go is likely to join this list soon. We've been careful to keep our architecture componentized.
* Tons of our code is open source. Check it out: <a href=""https://github.com/inboxapp"" >
* We're 40% women on our team of 11 (10 engineers), including 1 of 2 cofounders. We want to make that number 50%.
* Our sunny Mission office is more lived-in than tidy. Think art studio, not corporate.
* We're more likely to end up at the climbing gym or on a bike ride together than out drinking at the latest startup event.
* We have an open vacation policy and value personal responsibility and ownership.
Apply via Lever at <a href=""https://www.inboxapp.com/jobs"" >. Include a cover letter letting us know what draws you to the job. We welcome and encourage applications from women and people of colour.

"Expensify-San Francisco, CA-Fulltime, Programmer Extraordinaire
Hey there! Allow us to introduce ourselves. We are Expensify and we do ""expense reports that don't suck!"" (Google ""expensify"" to read more.) We're getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren's call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:
- An incredibly hard worker, even when it's not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all — we do the sucky work so our customers won't need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.
- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn't a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month (on your own dime, sorry) and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We've done Thailand, Mexico, India, Turkey, Croatia and the Philippines. We are going to Portugal this month! Want to come?
- Super talented, in a general way. We're going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing/designing/building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job — you're going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.
- Specifically talented in a programming way. You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL — not because you know them all, but because you're the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you're this sort of person, you'll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn't for you.
And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That's a problem because while I know you are awesome, it's actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I'm going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don't accidentally overlook you?
There are probably many ways to do that. But the easiest way to do that is to check out we.are.expensify.com and send in an application(which you can find at <a href=""http://we.are.expensify.com/apply"" >). We are excited to hear from you!

"UpOut - SoMA San Francisco. No Remote.
Merchant Relations 3 Month Internship
UpOut is a discriminating guide to the best weird parties, underground culture and unique happenings in your city. Our mission is to help make that epic night out, perfect first date or relaxing afternoon happen. We are a small passionate team started by two best friends in their dorm room. We've been through Tandem's incubator and are backed by some of Silicon Valley's best investors.
What You'll Do
Since the early days of UpOut, we've worked to help the culture maestros of San Francisco, the event organizers. These awesome people put together the events and activities that define the culture of our beautiful city. As part of the Merchant Relations Team, you'll focus on building strong lasting relationships with local merchants. You will work directly with merchants to help make their events amazing. Although your core competency will be in creating persuasive promotion campaigns, you'll also use our vast event expertise to advise them in their event making decisions. Your core responsibilities will be:
- Advise event organizers. You'll be working one on one with event organizers suggesting better event names, images and putting together promotion plans.
 - Learn and perform analysis. Use data to build better processes within the Merchant Relations team. You'll be able to affect the tools we build, the process and more.
 - Research the event business. Read, think and write about the event industry to get insider insights into the business. Of course, you'll also go to a ton of events.
You have great communication skills, attention to detail and boatloads of creativity. You're that friend who plans for everyone else. Previous sales experience is a huge plus. You're hungry to learn more and think that a small (but fast growing) team is the best place to do that.
This is a paid full time 3 month internship (2 weeks training + 10 weeks work). A full time position may be offered at the end of the internship based on performance.

"Software Engineer at Aircloak - REMOTE ((UTC +2) +- 2)
My name is Sebastian, and I am the CTO at Aircloak. Aircloak is a young and well-funded startup working on privacy preserving data processing and analytics. We are a spinout from the German Max-Planck Institute for Software System research institute and receive a lot of backing and support from the institute and their extended network.
Our technology allows us to process highly private streams of data and only ever make fully anonymous data available to our customers. One of the features that make our system unique is that no one, including operators, customers, and ourselves, ever has access to the sensitive raw data. This property holds true even after we update the software running on the machines processing the sensitive data!
You should:
    - be intelligent
    - have a good sense of humour
    - be an amazing programmer
    - wish to change the world

Our system spans many machines and services, with major components written in Erlang and Java, in addition to components written in C, C# and ruby. Knowledge of functional programming is a plus. Experience with web development is not going to hurt either.
The founding team consists of recent University of Cambridge graduates and a director at the Max-Planck Institute. In the past month we have also been joined by two excellent engineers.
The work environment is highly international and diverse, and we would like to keep it that way. We are looking to hire one additional engineer, and are in the lucky position where we can afford to be picky with whom we choose.
Our team is distributed, and we would therefore expect you to work remotely as well. We would prefer if you were located within one or two timezones of our own (UTC+2).
We offer good and stable salary, generous equity, exciting problems to solve, and a fabulous team, and in turn expect you to be driven, social, and good at solving problems.
We hope to hear from you. Please email us at REDACTED_EMAIL if you have any questions!

"Stealth biotech - Menlo Park, CA
Envision a massive, fully-automated research facility that moves around, mixes, and analyzes cells and molecules on a scale equivalent to millions of technicians doing the work by hand.  We'll call it the world's first ""biological server farm""--biology will become a programming discipline, and biologists won't need their own labs anymore.
Want to help us build it?
We're a well-funded, stealth startup based in Menlo Park, founded by scientists and engineers who want to solve biology in their lifetimes.
We're looking for extremely talented software engineers from a variety of backgrounds.  We're working mainly with C++ and Python in a Linux environment.  If you've worked with scientific data, instrumentation, or robotics, your skills may be appropriate.  But if you're exceptionally smart and motivated, no background in science is required.

"Software developer, Stat.io - Cambridge UK, or REMOTE
We aim to allow users to understand the socio-economics of any location, from the population of a country to the crime rate of a postcode. Organisations can then use this data to improve their decision-making, whether it's businesses making strategic sales and marketing decisions, NGOs trying to understand a country, or somebody else entirely.
The two main technical challenges we face are:
* Importing data from many different sources, from APIs to Excel files, and understanding their structure. For instance, given an Excel file, we need to determine the structure of any tables, such as which columns represent a location. We also want to pick up as much metadata as possible, such as a description of the dataset.
* Designing a UI that allows users to find what they're looking for, and then making that UI fast (we're currently up to about 10,000,000 datasets and 200,000,000 data points)
Our technology stack:
* Postgres + PostGIS to store the data we've imported
* Elasticsearch for... search
* Python code to import data from the original source to our database (with a tiny bit of Redis for some basic queueing)
* A thin PHP web application to display the data (probably soon to be replaced by node.js)
Things we like:
* Test-driven development and good test coverage (when it makes sense -- sometimes, it's better to manually test a very thin UI than to keep worrying about brittle UI tests)
* Releasing early and often. We deploy features as they're ready, and try to break work down to small pieces.
* Doing the simplest thing that could possibly work. Rather than planning for every possibility up front, we implement something small but useful to start with, and then iterate and refactor as necessary.
What we're looking for:
We were founded in Cambridge last year, and we're now working towards a product covering public data for the UK.
We're looking for a software developer to join us, initially part-time for £1,000 a month + stock option plan. We're joining Microsoft Ventures in London from February 2013, so you can join us in Cambridge or London, or work remotely.
If you have any questions, feel free to get in touch: REDACTED_EMAIL. If you'd like to apply, please send us a CV and a paragraph describing why you're interested.

"Scribd (YC '06), San Francisco - VISA, FULL-TIME, and INTERN are all welcome
Scribd (""Netflix for eBooks"", top 100 website, 50 people) is hiring talented hackers of all kinds to help us build the library of the 21st century.
We've hired EIGHT full-time people and TONS of interns from these ""Who is Hiring"" threads ... it really works!
We're looking for people who want to work with:
* Ruby on Rails (we're the #2 largest rails site, after Twitter)
* Javascript (well, we use Coffeescript)
* iOS OR Android (we're a top 10 eBook app with more reviews than Wikipedia, with a small mobile team)
*  Data science / data analysis (using big data tools like hive to analyze an amazing proprietary dataset)
* Machine Learning / data mining / recommendations - think Netflix prize, but for books!
* Product manager and design (UI or UX) roles too
* Internships: junior standing or above for all areas of engineering. We hire several interns every summer and year-round.
That said, we care way more about your personality and general hacking skills then what languages you've used so far, so if you haven't used these but want to break into mobile or web development, this could be a good opportunity for you. We've hired people from these threads with everywhere from 0 to 10 years of experience.
We're profitable, very well funded and have a really fun office environment (go-karts + a rock climbing wall!) in the center of the startup world in San Francisco. Scribd alumni have gone on to found 4 other YCombinator companies, more than from any other startup. We think this says something about the kind of people that we like to hire, and we love hiring people with entrepreneur and startup ambitions. We are also always looking for international people interested in moving to the US and can help you secure a visa.
You can read more about our ""Netflix for Books"" service here <a href=""http://wrd.cm/1dJquzz"" > or check out our tech blog at <a href=""http://coding.scribd.com"" >

We answers questions like: ""If everybody switched to electric cars, how many solar plants have to be built?"". It is used by governments, companies, teachers to evaluate strategies dealing with events like peak oil, diminishing gas reserves and new technologies.
Quintel develops the ETM and is a charming Dutch (grown up) startup, with a central office in the center of Amsterdam. Our engineering-driven team (91% engineers, PhDs etc) get the work done during office hours, so that we can enjoy our evenings, sometimes together with afterwork-beers. The atmosphere goes from professional consultancy to monkey house in no time.
Our codebase has something for everyone. 30% plain Ruby, 30% Javascript, 30% Rails and 10% other code. We have good code, bad code, tested code, untested code. We have DSLs (for our non-programmers), API, fast ec2 instances for calculations. Things we did before: Git as a database, custom query language to extract data from the model, massive processing within a rails request (think thousands of ruby objects calculating energy flows). Visualizations with Raphael.
You are an experienced developer, you think lean and solve problems creatively. You're proactive, fix first, complain later. You live in (ordered by preference): Netherlands, Europe, World. You'll work the first months onsite, thereafter you may go abroad and work remote (again). Current dev team has an international background: Italian, British, Dutch, Swiss, US.

Last year, Nest established the first corner stone of this vision by releasing its first learning Thermostats; recently, Nest delivered again by introducing the second version of the Thermostat, which was lauded by the New York Times as “gorgeous, elegant, and very, very smart.” [1]

To deliver on the vision of bringing Apple-like discipline to home automation, we are currently looking for motivated individuals with any of the following skill sets:
-Mobile Developer: iOS or Android
-Frontend developers: our frontend stack is in Django, and we’re also using Amber.js, Backbone.js, and more.
-Backend Developers: our stack is in Scala, and we’re more than happy to teach you horizontal/vertical scaling.
-Algorithm &#38; Machine Learning Experts: the thermostats provide tons of data we use to help people save energy.
-EE people in Networking, System Integration, Firmware...etc
We’re still a pretty small team but we’ve got big ambitions and are already having a tangible impact (wait ‘til you see our energy saving numbers). If you want to come change the world with us, please feel free to send us a note at REDACTED_EMAIL (or reply to this thread).

At Which?, we believe that individuals can be as powerful as the organisations they have to deal with in their daily lives. We engage in advocacy campaigns on various consumer protection issues and aim to promote informed consumer choice in the purchase of goods and services, by testing products, highlighting inferior products or services, raising awareness of consumer rights and offering independent advice.
But for us, that's not enough. We want to look after consumers wherever and whenever they are to help them make the right decisions. So, we're currently revamping our digital presence by building a better infrastructure to support our products.

The biggest challenge we face is designing and building a very broad range of other products in a more service-oriented and cross-platform manner. This will mean that there is a lot of starting from scratch, and having to decide upon the right tool for the right job (we're currently into Nodejs, Ruby, Java and PHP).
So if you are a great team player and you are into designing service oriented application, playing with large volume of data aggregation or you just love to solve challenging problems, we'd like to hear what you think. We are hiring front-end and back-end developers.

"Spotify's Service Infrastructure (SI) team in New York City is hiring.
We, the SI engineers, are on a mission to act as force multipliers for all Spotify engineers. We build and maintain software components that allow our feature teams to move fast without breaking things. Some examples of what SI engineers are currently working on:
- Core authentication systems for Spotify
- High-performance inter-system messaging software
- Core storage technologies (Cassandra, PostgreSQL)
- Service discovery and orchestration
The NYC-based SI team is just booting up and we're still quite small. New team members can expect to have a significant impact on our projects. Our mission is to revamp how Spotify deploys backend services and while we're currently looking at LXC, nothing is set in stone. As the team grows we'll start to branch off into other areas of the Spotify infrastructure universe. Lots of fun will be had.
If we are the right team for you, and vice versa, then you're probably a bit like us. Here are some of the traits that we share:
- a passion for programming and computing in a large scale distributed environment with millions of users
- significant familiarity with GNU/Linux or other UNIX-like systems
- knowledge of a couple of programming languages, typically including Python or Java
- an urge to KISS, to iterate, to deliver and to produce high quality software in the process
Does this sound like a place for you? If so, please reach out to us. We'd love to get to know you. Send us your CV (if you have one), a link to your hobby project or github and perhaps a short message to further explain who you are. Mention HN and we'll pay extra attention to your application.

We have about 80 employees right now. We pay full market salaries plus stock options, and you can take as much vacation as you need. Hours are typically 40-50 per week.
Our product is an adaptive learning platform, which means we use machine learning and ""big data"" techniques to deliver an individualized education to each student. Our eventual goal is to make a high-quality, adaptive education available to everyone in the world. The product is used by Arizona State University right now, and we recently signed a deal with Pearson to power many of their products.
Our code is a mix of Python, Java, and Scala. Most of our existing code is in Python, but we're working to scale up in a major way, which involves a migration to the JVM. Currently this involves a mix of Java and Scala, but our long-term goal is to move toward Scala. Consequently, we're really hot for Scala talent right now. Anyone who has experience taking Scala into production we would love to talk to right now.
You can reach me at knerd83 at gmail.com, and I'm a software engineer so I'll be able to answer any of your technical questions (e.g. why we're interested in Scala). Reach out if any of the following interest you:
* Using technology to democratize education.
* Machine learning and data mining, including approaches such as probablistic graphic models (PGMs), Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Monte Carlo Markov Chains.
* Functional programming (cf. Scala and Python).
* The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) internals and performance optimization.
* NoSQL databases (Cassandra and Redis).
* Thrift (the RPC protocol).
* Cloud computing (Amazon Web Services, Unix) and distributed systems.","Knewton: New York (NYC) funded startup seeking software engineers interested in functional programming, machine learning, distributed systems, and big data problems. +ONSITE, +REMOTE, +FULLTIME, +INTERN.

FULLTIME in SAN FRANCISCO, CA
ClassDojo is used by over 15mm teachers and students to manage behavior in the classroom, using real time feedback and rewards that can also be shared with parents. We're an edtech startup with funding some of the biggest names in the valley (Jeff Clavier, Ron Conway, General Catalyst, Mitch Kapor...), and we're one of the fastest growing education companies of all time. We're the only non-YC company that Paul Graham has ever invested in. We've built a product that makes a real difference and gets huge engagement with millions of kids, and we're about to take it to the next level, hopefully with you on board. We have a strong team, an extremely comfortable and relaxed environment and great salary + benefits. If you're a strong hacker who wants to use JavaScript to change the world, apply here:

Or email REDACTED_EMAIL. You can read about the work and environment here: <a href=""http://www.classdojo.com/jobs"" >
--------------------------
We're particularly looking for:
  * Frontend Engineer  

--------------------
What's the role?
--------------------
At the core of ClassDojo is a node.JSON API built on node.js which makes use of multiple services and handles hundreds of requests per second. The frontend web application talks to this API, and it's a single page app that uses our own (soon to be open-sourced) JS framework - mojo.js - which combines the best bits of Backbone, Ember and Angular. That means great templating with powerful and efficient data-binding, but plenty of flexibility to build apps quickly. You'll work on this and other awesome tools, and you'll build a lot of user-facing features that go out to millions of kids around the world every day. It's pretty rare to have impact like this, and as much freedom as we'll give you.
Everyone on our team agrees that this is the most exciting phase of the company that we've seen, and we're growing so quickly that we're all very eager to meet and work with you!
--------------------
What skills are we looking for?
--------------------
* This is primarily an engineering role, rather than being design or CSS focused. We'd like you to be really strong on JavaScript fundamentals, up-to-date with modern JS engineering, and familiar with advanced DOM manipulation.
* Having said that, some minimal design chops would be cool...
* ...but not essential. We do have designers.
* A good sense of product and a desire to have a creative role in designing product features is important to us.
* You love building things well and building them quickly - like us!
The best way to show this off is to point to things you've built. We'd love to see personal projects which demonstrate the above.

"We’re a YC company building financial services tools. We're already cash-flow positive, and laptops, and office snacks, and etc. and so forth. and general good things. Here's what's awesome: we have non-technical customers paying us for an online tool. Everyday, our clients call and email to say that we're making them happy. And that feels great.
But there's one problem: parts of our product are a little bit ugly and a little bit confusing. We're rapidly adding new features, and we're quickly outpacing our design capabilities. In short, it’s time to hire a UX/UI designer.
Our clients use our product for hours at a time. This is their tool for getting their jobs done. It is their workflow. We want it to beautiful and intuitive. It should be easy for a new client to learn, while at the same time, it should make power users feel like they’re flying through their day.
You must have experience with The Struggle of Application Design. And frankly, you should enjoy this struggle, because it’s hard to get things right, but really rewarding when you do.
What would your first day on the job be like? Well, we’ve got a product live right now that processes several hundred orders per day. You now own the design and you will be responsible for improving it. Changes could be simple, like, ‘make this button blue’ or it could be more elaborate like, ‘add tooltips and a new customer tutorial,’ or maybe you might want to redesign aspects of the site from scratch. Ideally, within a couple weeks, clients should be telling us that they’ve noticed small, nice design improvements.
List of Responsibilities: - Design - Usability and Utility are more important (at the moment) than purely visual appeal. As a team, we frequently meet with our clients to learn how they’re using the product. A good candidate for this role will be able to speak to users and feel out their feelings.
List of Skills: - UI/UX design experience - Responsive design experience (a lot of our clients access our site on their phones) - HTML/CSS is great. At the moment, we’re using a lot of Bootstrap. Pixel perfect designs are not (yet) crucial; usability is paramount.
We’re in San Francisco on a trolley-filled street in Union Square. We’re small (3 in-office employees) and we’re still building a culture. If you have ideas for how to build a blissed-out company, we’re all ears. Thinking of moving to San Francisco, but not yet ready to commit? Talk to us.

"London UK: Junior test automation engineer. Permanent, full-time, on-site.
At YouView we are automating the testing of our product (a set-top box) using stb-tester[1], a tool that we developed and open-sourced which captures video from the set-top box and analyses it in real time.
These are early days for the project, so you can have a large impact on its direction and success. One week you might be writing a python module to control a network-controllable power supply; another week it might be a script to generate comprehensive test coverage of a menu tree. There will be tedious work too, but we want the kind of person who hates tedious work so much that they automate it away.
Unix shell scripting and administration experience is highly desirable. The test scripts themselves are written in python.

The list of important and interesting projects we want to tackle is ever-increasing. Because the range of projects is diverse, we need a full-stack Rails engineer with experience working on a wide variety of projects.
You’ll work on projects like: improving our natural language date range search, implementing integrations with 3rd party services, or working to improve the responsiveness and reliability of our API. You’ll also work with the entire team in creating new customer-facing features, from idea, through prototype, to release and maintenance.
* Our backend runs on Rails with MySQL, Redis, and Elasticsearch on AWS. You should have experience building scalable and maintainable services with Rails.
* Our front-end is built with CoffeeScript, SASS and HAML. You should have a deep understanding of HTML, CSS and Javascript.
* The glue between our front-end and back-end is HTTP, so you should have a thorough understanding of this part of the stack including: cookies, caching, AJAX, cross-domain sharing, security issues, etc.
* We write automated tests for all of our code. You should be passionate about testing since you know it’s the only way to deliver high quality software.
We are looking for someone who can spend about 10 hours per week contracting with us, so we can both get a sense of what it’s like working together. We’d love for you to be in the Pacific timezone, but we’re open to the right person, anywhere.
While this is a contracting opportunity to start, we are always looking for the right person to join the team full-time. We believe working together on a contract basis initially is critically important before bringing someone on as a full-time member of the team.
If you’re interested, please send a link to your Github account and any projects you’ve worked on recently that you are particularly proud of. We prefer great work over resumes.

Building the ""Internet Talmud"" to annotate and explain the world's primary source text
  * Front-end developer with an eye for design (UI/UX/CSS/jQuery)
  * iOS Developer (you know, iOS)
  * Full stack software engineer (Rails)

Over the past few years, Rap Genius has gone from tiny side-project to one of the biggest music sites on the internet. We’ve raised 15 mil from some pretty dope investors and grown to employ some of the most talented devs this world has ever seen. We’re expanding from explaining rap into ALL OF TEXT, starting with poetry, rock, and news. Now were looking for genius full-stack web and iOS developers to help build the “Internet Talmud”, the one platform for explaining the world’s primary source texts.
Why would you want to work for us?
  * One of the fastest-growing sites on the internet, SERIOUSLY THIS IS BASED ON
    ACTUAL NUMBERS.
  * Tiny, quick-shipping team with a ton of autonomy – so you never think to yourself:
    “what did i accomplish this year/month/30 seconds ago?”
  * A development and design agenda that is led by developers and designers –
    so no marketing or product people telling you how the image carousel should work.
  * Gym in building, free food, sweet benefits, whatever computer you want, more
    money than your last job, equity, etc.
  * Live in New York, where a new restaurant is born every 1.5 seconds!

A little about the dev team:
  * Seven people total: five backend, one front-end/design, and one TOTALLY
    SICK intern.
  * Independently led projects.
  * We iterate quickly and push code to production constantly.
    We're not afraid to put the ""first draft"" of a feature in production
    to see how it behaves in the wild before perfecting it.
  * Projects and priorities are determined communally (usually over burritos).
  * Ruby on Rails via Heroku + Sass, Compass, jQuery, Git, and more!

More about the positions:
Are you a boss front-end developer with an eye for design? Hit us up. A bomb iOS developer who wants to build the Rap Genius iPhone app from the ground up? An experienced and creative full-stack Rails engineer? We’ve been waiting for you. Send us your deets.
Interested? Hit us up at REDACTED_EMAIL with:
  * Your name and online identity – i.e., your Twitter, Github, blog,
    Stack Overflow account, personal website, etc.
    The more info the better.
  * Location – you can’t get the true RG cult effect working remotely, so only apply
    if you live in NYC or are willing to relocate.
    Our office is in Williamsburg.
  * Educational background and/or most recent job
  * A little bit about your technical background,
    including something brief about what you like
    and dislike about the technologies you’ve used.
  * If you come in for an interview, you’ll start by making a short
    technical presentation to the team and taking their questions.
    What will you present?
  * THE MOST IMPORTANT: What have you built online that you’re proud of?","Rap Genius - Brooklyn, NY - http://rapgenius.com >

We want someone who enjoys working hard and learning new things, but also does well in an environment with a lot of freedom and self supervision. We currently have a small, tight-knit team but are poised to scale up quickly, so this position has a lot of potential for growth for the right candidate. We've got some pretty impressive hardware resources to play with, and we respect powder days.
Necessary Skills:
* Demonstrated experience working with and administering Linux installations (Fedora/Red Hat preferred)
* Demonstrated experience developing software including automated testing
Nice to Have:
* Experience with Groovy, Bash, JavaScript, and Python scripting and development
* Web application development experience using a modern framework like Node.js, Rails, Django, or Grails
* Familiarity with Spock testing framework for Groovy
* Experience managing a grid compute environment (SunGrid)
VPN administration experience
* Experience building computers and working with server hardware
About Us:
We are a financial start-up located in Park City, UT capitalizing on exponentially improving processing power and machine learning algorithms to disrupt the money management industry. We combine state-of-the-art hardware (we've got our own, in-house GPU super computer) with a variety of machine learning techniques to develop data-inspired investment strategies. We strive for a ""Work Hard, Play Hard"" mentality and live in Park City for a reason - some of the best skiing, mountain biking, and hiking in the country is located right outside of our office.

FULLTIME in SAN FRANCISCO, CA
ClassDojo is used by over 15mm teachers and students to manage behavior in the classroom, using real time feedback and rewards that can also be shared with parents. We're an edtech startup with funding some of the biggest names in the valley (Jeff Clavier, Ron Conway, General Catalyst, Mitch Kapor...), and we're one of the fastest growing education companies of all time. We're the only non-YC company that Paul Graham has ever invested in. We've built a product that makes a real difference and gets huge engagement with millions of kids, and we're about to take it to the next level, hopefully with you on board. We have a strong team, an extremely comfortable and relaxed environment and great salary + benefits. If you're a strong hacker who wants to use JavaScript to change the world, apply here:

Or email REDACTED_EMAIL. You can read about the work and environment here: <a href=""http://www.classdojo.com/jobs"" >
--------------------------
We're particularly looking for:
  * Frontend Engineer  

--------------------
What's the role?
--------------------
At the core of ClassDojo is a node.JSON API built on node.js which makes use of multiple services and handles hundreds of requests per second. The frontend web application talks to this API, and it's a single page app that uses our own (soon to be open-sourced) JS framework - mojo.js - which combines the best bits of Backbone, Ember and Angular. That means great templating with powerful and efficient data-binding, but plenty of flexibility to build apps quickly. You'll work on this and other awesome tools, and you'll build a lot of user-facing features that go out to millions of kids around the world every day. It's pretty rare to have impact like this, and as much freedom as we'll give you.
Everyone on our team agrees that this is the most exciting phase of the company that we've seen, and we're growing so quickly that we're all very eager to meet and work with you!
--------------------
What skills are we looking for?
--------------------
* This is primarily an engineering role, rather than being design or CSS focused. We'd like you to be really strong on JavaScript fundamentals, up-to-date with modern JS engineering, and familiar with advanced DOM manipulation.
* Having said that, some minimal design chops would be cool...
* ...but not essential. We do have designers.
* A good sense of product and a desire to have a creative role in designing product features is important to us.
* You love building things well and building them quickly - like us!
The best way to show this off is to point to things you've built. We'd love to see personal projects which demonstrate the above.

We are a design driven team of three founders, focused on impeccable customer experience. We value simplicity, quality, and care. We believe in a collaborative, feedback-rich design process. We feel that great experiences can only come from teams who care deeply. We are building the company we’ve always wanted to exist. We share what this all means to us on our blog.
The list of important and interesting projects we want to tackle is ever-increasing. Because the range of projects is diverse, we need a full-stack Rails engineer with experience working on a wide variety of projects.
You’ll work on projects like: improving our natural language date range search, implementing integrations with 3rd party services, or working to improve the responsiveness and reliability of our API. You’ll also work with the entire team in creating new customer-facing features, from idea, through prototype, to release and maintenance.
* Our backend runs on Rails with MySQL, Redis, and Elasticsearch on AWS. You should have experience building scalable and maintainable services with Rails.
* Our front-end is built with CoffeeScript, SASS and HAML. You should have a deep understanding of HTML, CSS and Javascript.
* The glue between our front-end and back-end is HTTP, so you should have a thorough understanding of this part of the stack including: cookies, caching, AJAX, cross-domain sharing, security issues, etc.
* We write automated tests for all of our code. You should be passionate about testing since you know it’s the only way to deliver high quality software.
We are looking for someone who can spend about 10 hours per week contracting with us, so we can both get a sense of what it’s like working together. We’d love for you to be in the Pacific timezone, but we’re open to the right person, anywhere.
While this is a contracting opportunity to start, we are always looking for the right person to join the team full-time. We believe working together on a contract basis initially is critically important before bringing someone on as a full-time member of the team.
If you’re interested, please send a link to your Github account and any projects you’ve worked on recently that you are particularly proud of. We prefer great work over resumes.

"Clerky - REMOTE - Software Engineer (Ruby on Rails, Javascript)
Help fix the legal industry!
The way legal transactions are done is filled with inefficiencies, which leads to ridiculously high legal fees. We're fixing this by building software that automates and streamlines the process.
We're profitable and growing. We launched a company formation service last year, and are now one of the most popular ways for high-growth technology startups to incorporate. Y Combinator and 500 Startups both use our software to handle their investment paperwork.
If you are interested in fixing the legal industry, this is arguably the best place to be (no hyperbole).
We use a lot of Ruby on Rails and Javascript, so familiarity with these technologies is a requirement. That said, we're not religious about any particular technology - we believe in using the right tool for a given problem (we also have services written in Scala and Go). We have extensive spec and feature coverage, and have everything hooked up to a continuous integration server.
This is a great fit for people who want to work:
... at a product-driven company bringing an old-fashioned industry into the future
... on a product that has a lot of usage and visibility in the startup community
... in a company that strongly values good software development practices
... at a financially sound company
... hard, with ownership and dedication (but sustainably)
... with flexible hours and competitive pay
... where you'll be a key early hire
Some hard requirements we have:
- An inability to write anything but clean, maintainable code.
- Bothered by code without test coverage.
- 5+ years of experience building software as part of a team with strong development practices
- 5+ years of experience with Rails and Javascript
We are not looking for consultants. This position is for full-time employment.
If all of this sounds good to you, please send (1) your resume and (2) a code sample that you're proud of to jobs at clerky.com.","Clerky - REMOTE - Software Engineer (Ruby on Rails, Javascript)

"Front-end/Full-stack Web Developer - DTU Biosustain - Copenhagen Area, Denmark - VISA
Our research institute genetically engineers microbes for the production of chemicals that might otherwise be produced using petroleum-based feedstock. (We work with fine chemicals, not biofuels). Our aim is to apply an engineering process to something that used to be a slow and expensive scientific workflow. For that purpose we are building a mostly web-based platform to automate the engineering process and collect and analyze experimental data. We are looking for another developer to help out with this; someone who can take ownership of what they build and potentially grow into a lead developer position in the future.
Our web stack currently, in no specific order: AngularJS, ECMAScript2015, Redis, Python 3, Flask, PostgreSQL 9.4, Socket.IO, Docker. The application is very front-end centric so most of the work will always be done in JavaScript. The API is written in Python and our scientists write most of their algorithms in Python. We currently use AngularJS for the front-end, however this is not set in stone.
We will help with getting a VISA, as well as with administrative issues related to relocation. Our working language is English. We are a very diverse workplace; 70% of our staff have an international background.
The salary depends on qualifications and needs to be agreed by your union representative -- so I cannot give an official range -- but a rough personal estimate is DKK 450k-600k.

"We’re a YC company building financial services tools. We're already cash-flow positive, and laptops, and office snacks, and etc. and so forth. and general good things. Here's what's awesome: we have non-technical customers paying us for an online tool. Everyday, our clients call and email to say that we're making them happy. And that feels great.
But there's one problem: parts of our product are a little bit ugly and a little bit confusing. We're rapidly adding new features, and we're quickly outpacing our design capabilities. In short, it’s time to hire a UX/UI designer.
Our clients use our product for hours at a time. This is their tool for getting their jobs done. It is their workflow. We want it to beautiful and intuitive. It should be easy for a new client to learn, while at the same time, it should make power users feel like they’re flying through their day.
You must have experience with The Struggle of Application Design. And frankly, you should enjoy this struggle, because it’s hard to get things right, but really rewarding when you do.
What would your first day on the job be like? Well, we’ve got a product live right now that processes several hundred orders per day. You now own the design and you will be responsible for improving it. Changes could be simple, like, ‘make this button blue’ or it could be more elaborate like, ‘add tooltips and a new customer tutorial,’ or maybe you might want to redesign aspects of the site from scratch. Ideally, within a couple weeks, clients should be telling us that they’ve noticed small, nice design improvements.
List of Responsibilities: - Design - Usability and Utility are more important (at the moment) than purely visual appeal. As a team, we frequently meet with our clients to learn how they’re using the product. A good candidate for this role will be able to speak to users and feel out their feelings.
List of Skills: - UI/UX design experience - Responsive design experience (a lot of our clients access our site on their phones) - HTML/CSS is great. At the moment, we’re using a lot of Bootstrap. Pixel perfect designs are not (yet) crucial; usability is paramount.
We’re in San Francisco on a trolley-filled street in Union Square. We’re small (3 in-office employees) and we’re still building a culture. If you have ideas for how to build a blissed-out company, we’re all ears. Thinking of moving to San Francisco, but not yet ready to commit? Talk to us.
Send an email to REDACTED_EMAIL telling us about yourself. Include a resume and a portfolio if possible.","We’re a YC company building financial services tools.

Why we're cool:
Well our users certainly think we are (check out the reviews on the app stores). But the media love us as well!
We've been named one of 7 ""Startups to Watch"" by Inc. Magazine, and to Entrepreneur Magazine's list of 100 Brilliant Companies.
We've also gotten tons of shoutouts from the press and media such as the NBC's Today Show, Real Simple, CNN, and Lifehacker just to name a few.","iOS SOFTWARE ENGINEER - INTERN/CONTRACT, AND TO FULLTIME/HiRE - Palo Alto, CA

I am not personally sure (I'm a software engineer) about H1-B but I will refer any visa questions to someone who can answer them.
Investors include Peter Thiel (Founder's Fund), Reid Hoffman, and Pearson, a leader in educational publishing. We were recognized as a Technology Pioneer for 2011 by the World Economic Forum in Davos and one of the top 25 best places to work by Crain’s New York Business.
We have about 80 employees right now. We pay full market salaries plus stock options, and you can take as much vacation as you need. Hours are typically 40-50 per week.
Our product is an adaptive learning platform, which means we use machine learning and ""big data"" techniques to deliver an individualized education to each student. Our eventual goal is to make a high-quality, adaptive education available to everyone in the world. The product is used by Arizona State University right now, and we recently signed a deal with Pearson to power many of their products.
Our code is a mix of Python, Java, and Scala. Most of our existing code is in Python, but we're working to scale up in a major way, which involves a migration to the JVM. Currently this involves a mix of Java and Scala, but our long-term goal is to move toward Scala. Consequently, we're really hot for Scala talent right now. Anyone who has experience taking Scala into production we would love to talk to right now.
You can reach me at knerd83 at gmail.com, and I'm a software engineer so I'll be able to answer any of your technical questions (e.g. why we're interested in Scala). Reach out if any of the following interest you:
* Using technology to democratize education.
* Machine learning and data mining, including approaches such as probablistic graphic models (PGMs), Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Monte Carlo Markov Chains.
* Functional programming (cf. Scala and Python).
* The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) internals and performance optimization.
* NoSQL databases (Cassandra and Redis).
* Thrift (the RPC protocol).
* Cloud computing (Amazon Web Services, Unix) and distributed systems.","Knewton: New York (NYC) funded startup seeking software engineers interested in functional programming, machine learning, distributed systems, and big data problems. +ONSITE, +REMOTE, +FULLTIME, +INTERN.

"London, UK. (INTERN ok)
Django Developers at Wildfish, <a href=""http://wildfish.com"" >http://wildfish.com</a>
We're an independent London based Django consultancy looking to expand our team.  We work on web applications for startups, other clients, and our own hairbrain schemes.  We've mostly been working with freelancers, but are now looking to start putting together a permanent team to take things to the next level.  We're all developers, so understand the things which are important and which aren't.
Our office is in London Bridge, so you'll need to be within occasional commute distance of there, but a mixture of remote on site work seems to work best for most of us, so that's fine too.
These are some of the technologies we're working with, so please mention any experience, skills or interest in any of them:
- Python
- Django
- Testing (TDD, nose, django-webtest, factory-boy)
- gevent, gevent-socketio
- Ubuntu Linux server admin (Linode, AWS, Fabric, Salt, Nginx)
- PostgreSQL, Redis
- Django CMSs (Django CMS 2, FeinCMS, Mezzanine, others)
- HTML/CSS/Bootstrap
- Javascript (and any frameworks)
It's more important that someone can demonstrate they know their stuff rather than have lots of commercial experience necessarily, so please include any links which might show that (other projects/Github/HackerNews/SO, etc).
We'd also like someone who's interested in helping us build the profile of the company but contributing back to the community, including paid time contributing to open source projects, writing blog posts, and developing our own internal infrastructure or cool things you or we may dream up.
Please email REDACTED_EMAIL with your details and salary expectations.  Would possibly also consider those interested in part time work.
Thanks!","London, UK. (INTERN ok)

"Spotify's Service Infrastructure (SI) team in New York City is hiring.
We, the SI engineers, are on a mission to act as force multipliers for all Spotify engineers. We build and maintain software components that allow our feature teams to move fast without breaking things. Some examples of what SI engineers are currently working on:
- Core authentication systems for Spotify
- High-performance inter-system messaging software
- Core storage technologies (Cassandra, PostgreSQL)
- Service discovery and orchestration
The NYC-based SI team is just booting up and we're still quite small. New team members can expect to have a significant impact on our projects. Our mission is to revamp how Spotify deploys backend services and while we're currently looking at LXC, nothing is set in stone. As the team grows we'll start to branch off into other areas of the Spotify infrastructure universe. Lots of fun will be had.
If we are the right team for you, and vice versa, then you're probably a bit like us. Here are some of the traits that we share:
- a passion for programming and computing in a large scale distributed environment with millions of users
- significant familiarity with GNU/Linux or other UNIX-like systems
- knowledge of a couple of programming languages, typically including Python or Java
- an urge to KISS, to iterate, to deliver and to produce high quality software in the process
Does this sound like a place for you? If so, please reach out to us. We'd love to get to know you. Send us your CV (if you have one), a link to your hobby project or github and perhaps a short message to further explain who you are. Mention HN and we'll pay extra attention to your application.

ClassDojo is used by over 15mm teachers and students to manage behavior in the classroom, using real time feedback and rewards that can also be shared with parents. We're an edtech startup with funding some of the biggest names in the valley (Jeff Clavier, Ron Conway, General Catalyst, Mitch Kapor...), and we're one of the fastest growing education companies of all time. We're the only non-YC company that Paul Graham has ever invested in. We've built a product that makes a real difference and gets huge engagement with millions of kids, and we're about to take it to the next level, hopefully with you on board. We have a strong team, an extremely comfortable and relaxed environment and great salary + benefits. If you're a strong hacker who wants to use JavaScript to change the world, apply here:

Or email REDACTED_EMAIL. You can read about the work and environment here: <a href=""http://www.classdojo.com/jobs"" >
--------------------------
We're particularly looking for:
  * Frontend Engineer  

--------------------
What's the role?
--------------------
At the core of ClassDojo is a node.JSON API built on node.js which makes use of multiple services and handles hundreds of requests per second. The frontend web application talks to this API, and it's a single page app that uses our own (soon to be open-sourced) JS framework - mojo.js - which combines the best bits of Backbone, Ember and Angular. That means great templating with powerful and efficient data-binding, but plenty of flexibility to build apps quickly. You'll work on this and other awesome tools, and you'll build a lot of user-facing features that go out to millions of kids around the world every day. It's pretty rare to have impact like this, and as much freedom as we'll give you.
Everyone on our team agrees that this is the most exciting phase of the company that we've seen, and we're growing so quickly that we're all very eager to meet and work with you!
--------------------
What skills are we looking for?
--------------------
* This is primarily an engineering role, rather than being design or CSS focused. We'd like you to be really strong on JavaScript fundamentals, up-to-date with modern JS engineering, and familiar with advanced DOM manipulation.
* Having said that, some minimal design chops would be cool...
* ...but not essential. We do have designers.
* A good sense of product and a desire to have a creative role in designing product features is important to us.
* You love building things well and building them quickly - like us!
The best way to show this off is to point to things you've built. We'd love to see personal projects which demonstrate the above.

"Ruby Developer  | Charlie (an early-stage, funded startup) | Chicago, IL
We're looking for a developer who's sort of a bad-ass. Can you think up mind-blowing solutions to complex, hairy problems? Do you get excited by things like graph databases and machine learning? We want someone who can move fast, think creatively, and deliver quality/tested code. Is this you?  Have at least a couple years of professional experience writing code.  Take a small risk and join us in building a growth business.
Who are we?
Before any meeting, Charlie automatically researches people before you see them.  Researching people is a complex problem: we sift through, analyze, and manipulate data into powerful insights (i.e. what are they passionate about, what do you have in common?).  CNBC called us “One of the world’s most promising new companies” and SXSW selected us as an Accelerator Finalist.
We’ve built Charlie to research people at massive scale, using the latest Ruby on Rails stack with MongoDB, Redis, Sidekiq, and hosted in an elastic cloud farm.  We write code with agility and have a tight process where anyone on the team can deploy to production at any time, without approval.  We thoroughly test our code, though we’re not strict TDD.  We're a small dev that loves to code, and constantly pushes, and learns from each other.
This is your opportunity to join an early-stage company that’s making moves.
Interested?  Find out more here:

"Front-end/Full-stack Web Developer - DTU Biosustain - Copenhagen Area, Denmark - VISA
Our research institute genetically engineers microbes for the production of chemicals that might otherwise be produced using petroleum-based feedstock. (We work with fine chemicals, not biofuels). Our aim is to apply an engineering process to something that used to be a slow and expensive scientific workflow. For that purpose we are building a mostly web-based platform to automate the engineering process and collect and analyze experimental data. We are looking for another developer to help out with this; someone who can take ownership of what they build and potentially grow into a lead developer position in the future.
Our web stack currently, in no specific order: AngularJS, ECMAScript2015, Redis, Python 3, Flask, PostgreSQL 9.4, Socket.IO, Docker. The application is very front-end centric so most of the work will always be done in JavaScript. The API is written in Python and our scientists write most of their algorithms in Python. We currently use AngularJS for the front-end, however this is not set in stone.
We will help with getting a VISA, as well as with administrative issues related to relocation. Our working language is English. We are a very diverse workplace; 70% of our staff have an international background.
The salary depends on qualifications and needs to be agreed by your union representative -- so I cannot give an official range -- but a rough personal estimate is DKK 450k-600k.

"Clerky - REMOTE - Software Engineer (Ruby on Rails, Javascript)
Help fix the legal industry!
The way legal transactions are done is filled with inefficiencies, which leads to ridiculously high legal fees. We're fixing this by building software that automates and streamlines the process.
We're profitable and growing. We launched a company formation service last year, and are now one of the most popular ways for high-growth technology startups to incorporate. Y Combinator and 500 Startups both use our software to handle their investment paperwork.
If you are interested in fixing the legal industry, this is arguably the best place to be (no hyperbole).
We use a lot of Ruby on Rails and Javascript, so familiarity with these technologies is a requirement. That said, we're not religious about any particular technology - we believe in using the right tool for a given problem (we also have services written in Scala and Go). We have extensive spec and feature coverage, and have everything hooked up to a continuous integration server.
This is a great fit for people who want to work:
... at a product-driven company bringing an old-fashioned industry into the future
... on a product that has a lot of usage and visibility in the startup community
... in a company that strongly values good software development practices
... at a financially sound company
... hard, with ownership and dedication (but sustainably)
... with flexible hours and competitive pay
... where you'll be a key early hire
Some hard requirements we have:
- An inability to write anything but clean, maintainable code.
- Bothered by code without test coverage.
- 5+ years of experience building software as part of a team with strong development practices
- 5+ years of experience with Rails and Javascript
We are not looking for consultants. This position is for full-time employment.
If all of this sounds good to you, please send (1) your resume and (2) a code sample that you're proud of to jobs at clerky.com.","Clerky - REMOTE - Software Engineer (Ruby on Rails, Javascript)

Keywords: INTERN, VISA, FULLTIME.
Minimum education: Bachelor's degree in CS/EECS.
Minimum experience: 2 years.
Useful to know: Java, Maven, ZooKeeper, MongoDB, Lucene, Git.
Tone A (professional):
The backend team at Mapsense is a small but highly motivated group building scalable tools for geodata analysis. We're looking for an independent, experienced backend engineer to join our team and and contribute while learning the infrastructure. An ideal candidate would be comfortable with designing and implementing web APIs; building and testing autoscaled services; and being productive, professional, and personable on a daily basis.
Tone B (nerdy):
There's a word to describe the freezing of a machine that executes billions of electronic instructions per second, then examining its memory's contents bit, by, bit: debugging. If hitting breakpoints sends chills down your spine, you're probably cut out for backend engineering at Mapsense. Hack away at the backend of a complex but intuitive geodata analysis API, implemented as a distributed, autoscaled nexus of modern open source technologies. And in case joining a team of intelligent, highly motivated code ninjas isn't enough, we have one more guarantee: consider boredom a thing of the past.
Tone C (cute):
The one thing that sets Mapsense apart from all the other geodata startups is the sheer popularity of our cute office dog, Amos. To be honest, our backend engineering team is a little jealous of all that attention. They've already developed a versatile but highly intuitive API for geodata ingestion and analysis, all while placing massive emphasis on documentation, testing, and teamwork. But to really shine, they need some help! Will you be the next independent, experienced engineer to join the backend ranks and help surpass Amos' renown once and for all?
Tone D (challenging):
Tired of companies living off of boring CRUD APIs with a single, static database? So are we. The backend engineering team at Mapsense is building a distributed, scalable backend architecture to support the ingestion and analysis of massive amounts of geodata, but writing well-designed, documented, and fully tested code isn't easy. That's why we're only hiring highly motivated, independent engineers to join a tiny backend team always willing to commit to quality. It won't be easy, but nothing worth doing ever is.
Tone E (meaningful):
Help Mapsense revolutionize the process of geodata analysis by joining our backend engineering team in developing an incredibly versatile tool with use cases in a variety of industries, from climate to marketing to military. You'll have the opportunity to jump into a robust, scalable system built on the latest open source backend technologies, and work with a motivated group of engineers. Expect to grow from interesting engineering problems every day while transforming the world one data set at a time.","Message Position: Backend Engineer

Location: New York, NY
Postion: Full-time on-site software engineer
TheLadders' mission is to match people with the jobs that are right for them. In order to do that we need a strong engineering team.
Currently we are looking for a software engineer to join our Platform Engineering Team. This team is responsible for developing and maintaining the software and systems that power our websites, mobile applications, and marketing.
A few things about us:
* We try to use the right tool for the right job; maybe a shell script, maybe multiple Storm topologies communicating via RabbitMQ and reading data from internal web services. And while we have found some tools that work, we're always willing to incorporate new ones if they give us a new way of tackling a problem.
* We know that engineering is all about understanding tradeoffs, not applying the same solution over and over again to every problem.
* Sometimes we get to work with fun new tools (Scala, Clojure, Storm, Elastic Search), sometimes we work with old standards (Java, Python, Bash). Sometimes we write cool new code, sometimes we are on call dealing with a production issue.
* We think pushing code into production is only the beginning of our job. We are responsible for what we put out in the world, including monitoring and maintainence.
A few things about you:
* You're an engineer, but you know how to think like an operations person.
* You cut your teeth in open source software, and know how to find documents, read the source, ask for help, and report a bug.
* You're excited about glamorous work, but you're willing to sometimes do shit work, because in the end somebody has do it.
If this sounds interesting and you think you'd be a good match, or if you're interested in learning the skills to become a good match, please get in touch with Andrew Turley (REDACTED_EMAIL).","Company: TheLadders (http://theladders.com >)

Location: New York, NY
Postion: Full-time on-site software engineer
TheLadders' mission is to match people with the jobs that are right for them. In order to do that we need a strong engineering team.
Currently we are looking for a software engineer to join our Platform Engineering Team. This team is responsible for developing and maintaining the software and systems that power our websites, mobile applications, and marketing.
A few things about us:
* We try to use the right tool for the right job; maybe a shell script, maybe multiple Storm topologies communicating via RabbitMQ and reading data from internal web services. And while we have found some tools that work, we're always willing to incorporate new ones if they give us a new way of tackling a problem.
* We know that engineering is all about understanding tradeoffs, not applying the same solution over and over again to every problem.
* Sometimes we get to work with fun new tools (Scala, Clojure, Storm, Elastic Search), sometimes we work with old standards (Java, Python, Bash). Sometimes we write cool new code, sometimes we are on call dealing with a production issue.
* We think pushing code into production is only the beginning of our job. We are responsible for what we put out in the world, including monitoring and maintainence.
A few things about you:
* You're an engineer, but you know how to think like an operations person.
* You cut your teeth in open source software, and know how to find documents, read the source, ask for help, and report a bug.
* You're excited about glamorous work, but you're willing to sometimes do shit work, because in the end somebody has do it.
If this sounds interesting and you think you'd be a good match, or if you're interested in learning the skills to become a good match, please get in touch with Andrew Turley (REDACTED_EMAIL).","Company: TheLadders (http://theladders.com >)
